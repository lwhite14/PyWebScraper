"Gaps in academic literature on venture capitalists’ decision-making on funding for early-stage, high-tech ventures.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/94498/","Brusche, LA","January 2016","Recognizing venture capital as a crucial source of funds for life science start-ups, this review paper focuses on the academic literature on venture capitalists’ decision-making process on granting funding to early-stage, high-tech ventures. This review identified the following three issues: First, despite three dominant factors in venture capitalists’ decision-making process, which are identified to be the human, technological and financial aspects of the potential start-up, a great variety of further factors exists and generalization to a great extent is difficult. Secondly, little research has been conducted in Europe and little research employed inductive, qualitative methods. Thirdly, the latest study focusing on a ranking of the importance of decision-making factors for venture capitalists lies 29 years in the past and has been conducted with a North-American sample, leaving a gap for future research in Europe.","Tech","University of Leeds"
"Exposure of wild Caspian seals (Pusa caspica) to parasites, bacterial and viral pathogens, evaluated via molecular and serological assays.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197640/","Kydyrmanov, A; Karamendin, K; Kasymbekov, Y","March 2023","Disease surveillance of marine mammal populations is essential to understand the causes of strandings, identify potential threats to animal health, and to support development of conservation strategies. Here we report the first large multi-pathogen screening of prevalence for viruses, bacteria and parasites in a sample of 177 live, healthy, wild Caspian seals (Pusa caspica), captured and released during satellite telemetry studies 2007-2017. Employing molecular and serological assays we assess prevalence of pathogens known to be of significance for marine mammal health worldwide, and evaluate the results in relation to Caspian seal health and conservation. RT-PCR, and PCR assays find evidence for infection by Canine Distemper Virus (CDV), Phocine herpes virus, phocine adenovirus and Influenza A at prevalences of 5%, 6.4%, 21.7%, and 4% respectively. The genomes of CDV isolates collected in 2008 showed 99.59% identity with the 2000 Caspian seal CDV epizootic strain. A partial coding sequence for the Us2 gene from the Caspian seal herpes virus was identical to PhHV-1 isolate PB84, previously reported from a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), while amplicon sequences for the adenovirus polymerase gene indicated a novel strain. ELISA assays detected exposure to Influenza A (55% of tested samples), adenovirus (25%), coronavirus (6%), CDV (8%), herpes virus (94%), Toxoplasma gondii (2.6%) and heartworm (1%). Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests detected exposure to Influenza B at a prevalence of 20%, and Leptospira microscopic agglutination tests detected suspected exposure to Leptospira serovars in 9% of tested samples. Overall, the risks, profile and prevalence of pathogens in Caspian seals appear comparable to other wild phocid seal populations. Our results suggest Caspian seals have exposure pathways to pathogens with epizootic potential or ability to cause significant morbidity, and disease impacts could reduce the resilience of the population to other conservation threats. Caspian seals are listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and we recommend that resources are invested to support further surveillance programmes and to understand how anthropogenic pressures may influence future disease risks.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Shallow- and deep-ocean Fe cycling and redox evolution across the Pliensbachian–Toarcian boundary and Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event in Panthalassa.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/194241/","Chen, W; Kemp, DB; He, T","December 2022","The late Pliensbachian to early Toarcian was characterized by major climatic and environmental changes, encompassing the early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE, or Jenkyns Event, ∼183 Ma) and the preceding Pliensbachian–Toarcian boundary event (Pl/To). Information on seawater redox conditions through this time interval has thus far come mainly from European sections deposited in hydrographically restricted basins, and hence our understanding of the redox evolution of the open ocean (and in particular Panthalassa – the largest ocean to have existed) is limited. Here, we present high-resolution Fe-speciation and redox-sensitive trace metal data from two Panthalassic Ocean sections across the Pl/To and the T-OAE intervals, one deposited in deep water (paleo-water depth >∼2.7 km) and the other on a shallow margin (paleo-water depth likely <∼50 m). Data from the deep-water open-ocean site indicate anoxic-ferruginous conditions from the late Pliensbachian to the onset of the T-OAE, with a rather fluctuating redox state alternating between oxic and anoxic/euxinic conditions across the Pl/To boundary. At least intermittent bottom-water euxinia characterized the T-OAE, followed by a subsequent transition toward more oxygenated conditions. By contrast, trace metal data from the shallow margin site indicate that oxygenated to possibly suboxic conditions prevailed. However, elevated highly reactive iron contents, dominated by Fe (oxyhydr)oxides, characterize this shallow-water site. These observations suggest that upwelling, driven in part by increased sea level and prevailing winds from the open ocean, brought anoxic-ferruginous waters onto the shelf, whereupon Fe2+ oxidation was initiated in oxic shallow waters.","Marine","University of Leeds"

"Integrating larval connectivity into the marine conservation decision-making process across spatial scales.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/194659/","Muenzel, D; Critchell, K; Cox, C","October 2022","Larval dispersal connectivity is typically integrated into spatial conservation decisions at regional or national scales, but implementing agencies struggle with translating these methods to local scales. We used larval dispersal connectivity at regional (hundreds of kilometers) and local (tens of kilometers) scales to aid in design of networks of no-take reserves in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. We used Marxan with Connectivity informed by biophysical larval dispersal models and remotely sensed coral reef habitat data to design marine reserve networks for 4 commercially important reef species across the region. We complemented regional spatial prioritization with decision trees that combined network-based connectivity metrics and habitat quality to design reserve boundaries locally. Decision trees were used in consensus-based workshops with stakeholders to qualitatively assess site desirability, and Marxan was used to identify areas for subsequent network expansion. Priority areas for protection and expected benefits differed among species, with little overlap in reserve network solutions. Because reef quality varied considerably across reefs, we suggest reef degradation must inform the interpretation of larval dispersal patterns and the conservation benefits achievable from protecting reefs. Our methods can be readily applied by conservation practitioners, in this region and elsewhere, to integrate connectivity data across multiple spatial scales.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"The inclusion of fisheries and tourism in marine protected areas to support conservation in Indonesia.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/195324/","Tranter, SN; Estradivari; Ahmadia, GN","September 2022","With the rapid growth of Indonesia’s marine protected area (MPAs) estate in Indonesia, reaching 23.9 million hectares by January 2020, attention needs to be focused on strengthening the effectiveness of MPA management. Consolidating and expanding protection of Indonesia’s marine resources is critical with increasing pressure from a fast-expanding population, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, pollution, coastal development, unsustainable tourism and climate change. Biodiversity conservation must therefore concurrently consider multiple economic sectors such as fisheries and tourism, and their synergies with MPA management. This paper aims to outline the current landscape of fisheries and marine tourism pertaining to area-based conservation in Indonesia, to inform and support improved integration into effective MPA management. Four areas to focus efforts were identified: diversification of governance types of community-based management, improved coordination between fisheries and MPAs during planning and management implementation, the development and support of pathways for sustainable tourism, and planning for future conditions. Sustainable development for fisheries and tourism must be incorporated into all aspects of MPA management, whilst recognising that current management systems are insufficient to ensure long-term sustainability for natural resources and local communities, and strategies need to increase resilience of social-ecological systems in anticipation of future conditions.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Enabling the informal recycling sector to prevent plastic pollution and deliver an inclusive circular economy.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/192223/","Velis, CA; Hardesty, BD; Cottom, JW","September 2022","Recycling by the informal sector provides a rapid, inexpensive solution to plastic pollution, whilst supporting the livelihoods via their inclusion and empowerment. This solution will have the greatest benefit to the environment if supporting interventions are targeted at types of plastic pollution that are the most damaging from an ecological and wider risk perspective. Interventions should target three aspects of the pollution: reducing barriers to collection, improving the revenue from the materials and wider informal recycler remuneration, and increasing the quality of the materials. Done well, these interventions will increase the collection rate, reduce pollution from plastics, and help millions of people escape poverty. They present a scalable international solution to a global challenge; and are likely the only viable solution to the widespread lack of solid waste services and infrastructure across low- and middle-income countries.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Dynamic ocean redox conditions during the end-Triassic mass extinction: Evidence from pyrite framboids.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/194884/","Li, J; Song, H; Tian, L","October 2022","The end-Triassic (∼201 Mya) records one of the five largest mass extinction events of the Phanerozoic. Extinction losses were coincident with large igneous province volcanism in the form of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) and major carbon isotope excursions (CIEs), suggesting a link between these phenomena. Marine anoxia has been implicated as a causal factor in the crisis, but there remains some uncertainty regarding the role of marine redox changes in marine extinction phases because both intensity and duration of marine anoxia are poorly constrained. We employ high resolution pyrite framboid size-frequency analysis at two Triassic-Jurassic (Tr-J) boundary sections: Kuhjoch in Austria (the Tr-J Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point; GSSP) and St. Audrie's Bay in England (former GSSP candidate) in order to further evaluate the role of marine anoxia in the end-Triassic mass extinction (ETME). The St. Audrie's Bay section records predominantly anoxic conditions punctuated by weakly oxygenated (dysoxic) conditions through the Tr-J transition, even during shallow-water intervals. Kuhjoch experienced both anoxic and dysoxic conditions during the ETME but became better oxygenated near the Tr-J boundary. Marine anoxia is therefore implicated in the extinction at both locations. A similar redox history is known from the Central European Basin, Western Tethys and Panthalassa, where marine anoxia developed in the lead up to the ETME prior to reoxygenation around the Tr-J boundary.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Alleviating impacts of climate change on fishing communities using weather information to improve fishers’ resilience.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/193695/","Okeke-Ogbuafor, N; Taylor, A; Dougill, A","October 2022","This study contributes new knowledge in evaluating actions aimed at alleviating impacts of climate change on small-scale fishers and enhancing resilience in their households in West Africa. Evidence of the damage caused by climate change to the artisanal fisheries sector in West African countries is accumulating. Current measures in place for artisanal fishers to adapt to these changes include broad long-term pro-poor strategies designed to manage the persistent problem of overfishing and declining fish stocks. However, one immediate coping strategy is beginning to emerge, the more active use of reliable weather information. Based on 80 semi-structured interviews conducted in Senegal, Ghana, and Nigeria between 2021 and 2022, this study investigates claims that the use of weather information (WI) is helping West African artisanal fishers and those involved in secondary fishery activities to build more climate-resilient household income and food security. Unlike the long-term measures for mitigating the impact of climate change, results from the study show that by assessing the risk, their marine capture activities using weather information, fishers are immediately benefitting. Using the diffusion of the innovation theory to investigate the pattern of fishers’ adoption and usage of weather information, we found that Senegalese marine artisanal fishers can be classified as “Early Adopters” of this innovation. However, this is not the case with inland fishers who remain skeptical and will only use weather information if they can ascertain its reliability. West Africa’s inland fisheries sector is often neglected in climate change strategies: there is a lack of coordinated action to understand the weather information needs of these vulnerable fishers in order to coassess and codevelop bespoke weather products that offer benefits to them. However, West Africa’s fisheries, especially those inland, are too important to ignore if the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), including no poverty and zero hunger, are to be achieved. To help this sector fully benefit from the use of weather information, this study recommends detailed research into the weather information needs of these fishers and user-friendly ways to engage with the fishers to transmit the information.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Short-takeoff marine vehicle with circulation flow control of wing-in-ground effect.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/192726/","Aslani, A; Shires, A; Shahsavari, A","July 2022","The concept of active circulation control has been proposed to improve lifting performance for various applications. It is mostly suggested as a flow control system to replace or minimize mechanical flaps or as a boundary layer control mechanism in the aerospace industry. The efficiency of these systems has always been the main concern due to increased drag and pumping requirements. These concerns are negligible for high-speed marine crafts as the hydrodynamic drag acting on the hull is dominant. This research investigates the aerodynamic performance of a NACA 4412 airfoil that was modified for circulation control to determine the influence of the trailing-edge geometry, blowing coefficient, angle of attack, and height above the ground to improve the efficiency of a wing-in-ground craft and shorten its take-off distance. The flow is subsonic and incompressible, and the chord Reynolds number is 1.7 × 106. A computational fluid dynamics investigation has determined that significant increases in lift can be attained through circulation control relative to the original NACA 4412 airfoil, and it is not significantly influenced by the airfoil height except when there is an extreme ground effect. Also, the lift augmentation increases approximately linearly with the blowing momentum coefficient and angle of attack. The study shows a significant improvement in the take-off length, which was reduced from 465 m to between 360 and 150 m according to the height above the ground plane, angle of attack, and the momentum coefficient when the Coanda surface is 30 mm. The circulation-controlled NACA 4412 could achieve 66% effectiveness compared to a currently available vehicle.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Canyon geomorphology has been characterised quantitatively in terms of maximum and average canyon dimensions, canyon sinuosity, average canyon thalweg gradient, and maximum canyon sidewall steepness. An assessment is made of how geomorphological characteristics vary with respect to the position of the canyon apex relative to the shelf break, continental-margin type, terrestrial source-to-sink system setting, oceanographic environment, and latitude. Scaling relationships between canyon morphometric parameters, and correlations between these and attributes of the canyon physiographic settings, terrestrial catchments, and continental shelves and slopes, have been quantified.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Comparing spatial conservation prioritization methods with site versus spatial dependency‐based connectivity.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/193940/","Muenzel, D; Critchell, K; Cox, C","September 2022","Larval dispersal is an important component of marine reserve networks. Two conceptually different approaches to incorporate dispersal connectivity into spatial planning of these networks exist, and it is an open question as to when either is most appropriate. Candidate reserve sites can be selected individually based on local properties of connectivity or on a spatial dependency-based approach of selecting clusters of strongly connected habitat patches. The first acts on individual sites, whereas the second acts on linked pairs of sites. We used a combination of larval dispersal simulations representing different seascapes and case studies of biophysical larval dispersal models in the Coral Triangle region and the province of Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, to compare the performance of these 2 methods in the spatial planning software Marxan. We explored the reserve design performance implications of different dispersal distances and patterns based on the equilibrium settlement of larvae in protected and unprotected areas. We further assessed different assumptions about metapopulation contributions from unprotected areas, including the case of 100% depletion and more moderate scenarios. The spatial dependency method was suitable when dispersal was limited, a high proportion of the area of interest was substantially degraded, or the target amount of habitat protected was low. Conversely, when subpopulations were well connected, the 100% depletion was relaxed, or more habitat was protected, protecting individual sites with high scores in metrics of connectivity was a better strategy. Spatial dependency methods generally produced more spatially clustered solutions with more benefits inside than outside reserves compared with site-based methods. Therefore, spatial dependency methods potentially provide better results for ecological persistence objectives over enhancing fisheries objectives, and vice versa. Different spatial prioritization methods of using connectivity are appropriate for different contexts, depending on dispersal characteristics, unprotected area contributions, habitat protection targets, and specific management objectives.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"“Please let me visit”: Management options for marine ecosystems in a Mediterranean Marine Protected Area.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/191723/","Tyllianakis, E","March 2022","Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as a means to support conservation of marine ecosystems is expected to depend on local communities and stakeholder’ participation and support. This paper presents the preferences of residents of Malta for measures intended to protect Posidonia oceanica seagrasses and coralligenous formations from threats from the anchoring and mooring of vessels in an offshore MPA area. The results indicate that only the most modest of restrictions increase the economic welfare of residents as participants are, overall, against further restrictions to enter the MPA. Survey participants wish to see an increase in provisioning ecosystem services such as fish caught and increases in carbon sequestration and are willing to pay to secure such benefits. Respondents also appear to have individualistic and use-driven values as a result of interacting with the MPA while past experiences play an important role in preferences, with frequent visitors strongly objecting to further restrictions to entry. The good current condition of the seagrass beds might explain the rejection of stringent restrictions but fails to account for threats from climate change and projected increase in tourism vessels’ visits. Such findings make co-operation and appropriate communication of threats and policies for management of marine resources through MPAs to the public more imperative.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"On Carbon Burial and Net Primary Production Through Earth’s History.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/182903/","Planavsky, NJ; Fakhraee, M; Bolton, EW","January 2022","The carbonate carbon isotope record has been traditionally interpreted as evidence of stability in the globally integrated ratio of organic to total carbon burial from Earth's surface environments over the past ∼3.8 billion years, but recent work has begun to question this conclusion. Herein, we use a reactive-transport modeling approach to track organic carbon oxidation at varying atmospheric oxygen levels and use that information to provide a rough estimate of net primary production through time. Our results support the emerging view that there was extensive variability in the fraction of carbon buried as organic matter (fb,org) throughout Earth's history. We strengthen the case that the carbonate carbon isotope record has been characterized by a relatively constant baseline value over time due to a fundamental mechanistic link between atmospheric O2 levels and the carbon isotope composition of net inputs to the ocean-atmosphere system. Further, using estimates of the organic carbon burial flux (Fb,org) and the burial efficiency of the carbon pump from our marine reactive-transport modeling, we also support previous work suggesting extensive fluctuation in marine net primary production over time.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Mapping the spatial distribution of global mariculture production.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/184748/","Clawson, G; Kuempel, CD; Frazier, M","February 2022","Mariculture (marine and brackish water aquaculture) has grown rapidly over the past 20 years, yet publicly-available information on the location of mariculture production is sparse. Identifying where mariculture production occurs remains a major challenge for understanding its environmental impacts and the sustainability of individual farms and the sector as a whole. We compiled known mariculture locations and applied a simple production-allocation approach to map remaining global mariculture locations across 73 countries using the key determinants of distance to shore and ports, and average productivity (tonnage) of known farms. Our map represents 96% of reported fish and invertebrate mariculture production for 2017, but excludes algae which constitutes half of global mariculture production. We provide, for the first time, a publicly available spatial database of known and estimated mariculture locations. We discuss the utility and limitations of the existing data and our modeling approach, and highlight the key data gaps and future challenges for mapping aquaculture. Our results provide a vital resource for mariculture and environmental researchers, but we emphasize the need for a standardized, ground-truthed global spatial database of aquaculture locations and farm-level attributes (e.g., species, production type) to better understand the distribution of production and adequately plan for future growth.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Late Permian–Middle Triassic magnetostratigraphy in North China and its implications for terrestrial-marine correlations.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/186497/","Guo, W; Tong, J; He, Q","March 2022","A detailed magnetostratigraphic study, linked to a new latest Permian U–Pb ID-TIMS age, was undertaken on the continental Shichuanhe section (SCH) in North China in order to provide a magnetic polarity scale for the Late Permian–early Middle Triassic interval. Tilt-corrected mean directions of the characteristic remanent magnetization pass the reversal test and correspond to a site paleolatitude of 18.1°N during the Early Triassic, consistent with previous results from the North China Block. The magnetostratigraphy shows close similarity with previous studies, allowing interregional correlations with both marine and non-marine records. Normal magnetozone SCH3n, constrained by an absolute age of 252.21±0.15 Ma from an ash bed 3.5 m below its base, is unambiguously correlated to the earliest Triassic normal magnetochron LT1n. Our newly established magnetostratigraphic framework and published carbon-isotope chemostratigraphy, indicate that the Permian–Triassic Boundary is ca. 8 m above the base of SCH3n (within the middle part of the Sunjiagou Formation) at SCH. The overlying reverse polarity dominated interval (SCH3r–SCH5r) ranges to the middle Liujiagou Formation, and straddles an interval from the mid-Griesbachian to mid-Smithian. The base of the Olenekian is provisionally located in the lower part of the Liujiagou Formation, near the base of magnetozone SCH5n. The succeeding thick normal magnetozone SCH6n persists into the upper Heshanggou Formation, with the inferred Smithian–Spathian boundary located in the upper part of the Liujiagou Formation. The transition from reverse magnetozone SCH6r to the overlying normal magnetozone SCH7n, coincides with a clear erosional contact with the base of the Ermaying Formation. Consequently, magnetozone SCH7n is matched to the Early Anisian magnetochron MT3n, with the Olenekian–Anisian boundary interval missing. Our new timescale provides additional magnetostratigraphic constraints on the timing of the terrestrial ecological crisis in North China, which is found to lie within reverse magnetozone SCH2r (equivalent with reverse magnetochron LP3r), a level some 270±150 kyrs before the main marine extinction, that falls in the overlying normal magnetochron LT1n.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"An efficient procedure to predict the dynamic loads for piston liner systems in marine engines.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/171885/","Xiuyi, L; Azam, A; Yuechang, W","January 2021","The piston ring-cylinder liner (PRCL) is one of the most important parts of marine diesel engines and contributes 25% to 50% of total friction loss. The lubrication simulation analysis of the PRCL system is a challenging task. Complete understanding and precise prediction of lubrication loads is a key to understanding the friction behavior of PRCL systems as the accuracy of the friction prediction depends upon precise prediction of lubrication loads. Therefore, this paper focuses on the gas pressure calculation which is the primary source of lubrication loads. The procedure presented combines the advantages of two mainstream methods to predict loads in the PRCL system. The result is a significant reduction in the computation time without compromising on accuracy. Firstly, a comparison of both approaches is presented which suggests that each technique has its limitations (one is time-bound, and one is accuracy-bound). Then, the results from both calculation methods are verified against literature and a parametric study is performed to identify the key structural parameters of PRCL system that affect the calculation efficiency. Finally, a correlation coefficient is introduced into the analysis to combine the two approaches which then identifies the conditions under which the use of the faster method becomes invalid and replaces it with the more accurate approach. This ensures optimum performance of the calculation procedure by switching between the fast and the accurate method depending upon the accuracy requirement under given conditions, thereby, simplifying the dynamic and lubrication model of PRCL systems. The study has direct implications for the tribological design of the PRCL interface.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Identifying economic costs and knowledge gaps of invasive aquatic crustaceans.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/181373/","Kouba, A; Oficialdegui, FJ; Cuthbert, RN","December 2021","Despite voluminous literature identifying the impacts of invasive species, summaries of monetary costs for some taxonomic groups remain limited. Invasive alien crustaceans often have profound impacts on recipient ecosystems, but there may be great unknowns related to their economic costs. Using the InvaCost database, we quantify and analyse reported costs associated with invasive crustaceans globally across taxonomic, spatial, and temporal descriptors. Specifically, we quantify the costs of prominent aquatic crustaceans — crayfish, crabs, amphipods, and lobsters. Between 2000 and 2020, crayfish caused US$ 120.5 million in reported costs; the vast majority (99%) being attributed to representatives of Astacidae and Cambaridae. Crayfish-related costs were unevenly distributed across countries, with a strong bias towards European economies (US$ 116.4 million; mainly due to the signal crayfish in Sweden), followed by costs reported from North America and Asia. The costs were also largely predicted or extrapolated, and thus not based on empirical observations. Despite these limitations, the costs of invasive crayfish have increased considerably over the past two decades, averaging US$ 5.7 million per year. Invasive crabs have caused costs of US$ 150.2 million since 1960 and the ratios were again uneven (57% in North America and 42% in Europe). Damage-related costs dominated for both crayfish (80%) and crabs (99%), with management costs lacking or even more under-reported. Reported costs for invasive amphipods (US$ 178.8 thousand) and lobsters (US$ 44.6 thousand) were considerably lower, suggesting a lack of effort in reporting costs for these groups or effects that are largely non-monetised. Despite the well-known damage caused by invasive crustaceans, we identify data limitations that prevent a full accounting of the economic costs of these invasive groups, while highlighting the increasing costs at several scales based on the available literature. Further cost reports are needed to better assess the true magnitude of monetary costs caused by invasive aquatic crustaceans.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Here, we report iron speciation and trace metal data from the Bristol Channel Basin and Larne Basin of the NW European epicontinental sea (EES), spanning the Triassic–Jurassic (T–J) transition (~ 202–200 Ma). Results show frequent development of anoxic-ferruginous conditions, interspersed with ephemeral euxinic episodes in the Bristol Channel Basin during the latest Rhaetian, whereas the contemporaneous Larne Basin remained largely oxygenated, suggesting heterogeneous redox conditions between basins. Subsequently, more persistent euxinic conditions prevailed across the T–J boundary in both basins, coinciding precisely with the second phase of the ETME. We propose that this later phase of benthic faunal loss in the NW EES was directly driven by the bottom-water oxygen crisis. Conversely, although anoxic conditions persisted into the early Hettangian, the benthos diversified at this time in nearshore areas. Post-extinction conditions were poised at a fluctuating redox state, but anoxia did not extend into the shallowest areas where benthic marine ecosystem recovery was occurring.","Marine","University of Leeds"

"The isotopic composition of sedimentary organic zinc and implications for the global Zn isotope mass balance.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/187484/","Zhang, Y; Planavsky, NJ; Zhao, M","September 2021","Zinc (Zn) is a bioessential element whose cycling in the marine environment is closely linked to the biological pump. As a vital micronutrient, Zn is depleted in marine surface waters and enriched in deep waters. This has given rise to the longstanding hope that Zn could serve as a robust paleoproductivity proxy. There has been a recent focus on how Zn isotope signatures can be used to track the evolution of the biological pump. However, the factors controlling variations in the sedimentary Zn isotope composition of core-top sediments are debated and these values are influenced by changes in the relative contributions of biological uptake and scavenging processes and by mineral fractionations. In order to provide a new perspective on the Zn isotopic signature of marine core-top sediments and their potential for tracing ocean biogeochemical processes, we developed a sample preparation procedure to extract organically bound Zn (excluding inorganic Zn) without a significant isotope fractionation. We tested five potential organic solvents and found that the isopropanol extraction procedure provided a reproducible and robust result that yielded the highest recovery rate of organically bound Zn without a significant associated isotopic fractionation and appeared to exclude common mineral bound forms of Zn. This extraction procedure was used to analyze the Zn concentrations and isotopic compositions (δ66Zn) of core-top sediment samples from Long Island Sound and the Peruvian continental margin. Our results suggest that the δ66Zn value of organic Zn increases with water depth, thus providing additional support for the finding that burial of isotopically light Zn occurs predominantly in shallow high-productivity sediments. However, we also found that the δ66Zn values of the estimated authigenic Zn component are consistently lighter than those of the organic Zn fraction, consistent with diagenetic (sediment pile) scavenging of organic derived Zn in sulfides imparting an isotope fractionation.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Personal attitudes and beliefs and willingness to pay to reduce marine plastic pollution in Indonesia.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/180617/","Tyllianakis, E; Ferrini, S","November 2021","Marine plastic pollution (MPP) is one of the most pressing issues especially for fast-growing economies in the Global South where addressing it involves both government and personal actions to achieve effective waste management policies. Alternative modelling strategies accounting for personal traits and beliefs (latent attitudes) which are unobservable characteristics are frequently overlooked in policy assessment studies. This study combines contingent valuation and latent traits questions to derive the willingness of Indonesian respondents to support MPP mitigation initiatives. One and two-step models are compared to test the sensitivity of results to modelling assumptions. Latent traits help to understand the willingness to pay (WTP) for MPP and one and two-step approaches produce comparable results. On average respondents are willing to pay £15, per person, per year to reduce MPP, or 2% of the average monthly salary. Local and international organizations should consider motivations and latent traits when designing MPP mitigation strategies.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Bioactive Trace Metals and Their Isotopes as Paleoproductivity Proxies: An Assessment Using GEOTRACES‐Era Data.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/195874/","Horner, TJ; Little, SH; Conway, TM","May 2021","Phytoplankton productivity and export sequester climatically significant quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide as particulate organic carbon through a suite of processes termed the biological pump. Constraining how the biological pump operated in the past is important for understanding past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and Earth's climate history. However, reconstructing the history of the biological pump requires proxies. Due to their intimate association with biological processes, several bioactive trace metals and their isotopes are potential proxies for past phytoplankton productivity, including iron, zinc, copper, cadmium, molybdenum, barium, nickel, chromium, and silver. Here, we review the oceanic distributions, driving processes, and depositional archives for these nine metals and their isotopes based on GEOTRACES-era datasets. We offer an assessment of the overall maturity of each isotope system to serve as a proxy for diagnosing aspects of past ocean productivity and identify priorities for future research. This assessment reveals that cadmium, barium, nickel, and chromium isotopes offer the most promise as tracers of paleoproductivity, whereas iron, zinc, copper, and molybdenum do not. Too little is known about silver to make a confident determination. Intriguingly, the trace metals that are least sensitive to productivity may be used to track other aspects of ocean chemistry, such as nutrient sources, particle scavenging, organic complexation, and ocean redox state. These complementary sensitivities suggest new opportunities for combining perspectives from multiple proxies that will ultimately enable painting a more complete picture of marine paleoproductivity, biogeochemical cycles, and Earth's climate history.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Codium fragile ssp. fragile is one of the most invasive species in the world. The species has deleterious impacts on marine ecosystems, but can also coexist with other Codium congeners, with neutral impact. Several invasive macroalgae have been described to occur along the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula, including C. fragile. However, despite its presence being noted in citizen science surveys, the occurrence of C. fragile on the coast of Portugal was not confirmed (except in the Azores Islands). The cryptic nature of this invasive macroalga has led to several misidentifications, and strict taxonomic approaches must therefore be used to confirm sightings. Previous intensive field sampling (2017–2018) aimed at recording the presence of different macroalgae did not find C. fragile along the Portuguese coast, northwards from Praia do Matadouro. Here, we report the first confirmed record of C. fragile on the coast of Portugal, in the Avencas Marine Park. Identification of the alga was confirmed by microscopic examination of the utricles. Early detection of invasive species is essential, and further research should be carried out in the surrounding areas in order to better understand the invasion pathways to enable correct application of management plans.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Estimating benthic trophic levels to assess the effectiveness of marine protected area management.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/174685/","Blanco, A; Beger, M; Planes, S","May 2021","Designating and managing marine protected areas (MPAs) can mitigate many ocean threats. Banning fishing activities within MPAs enhances the robustness of food-web dynamics and thus increases trophic resilience. Ecosystem function indicators, such as mean trophic level, are increasingly applied in conservation management. Stable isotope analysis is a common tool in trophodynamic studies as it provides information about food sources and trophic level within food webs. In contrast to the traditional top-down approaches in conservation management (mainly for fisheries), this study focuses on bottom-up responses to protection according to the target species in regional small-scale fisheries. The present study aimed to examine how MPA status affects trophodynamics in the rocky reefs of the Illas Atlánticas Marine-Terrestrial National Park (Galicia, NW Spain). Results showed no differences between inside and outside the MPA in species stable isotopic signatures or trophic level. However, these results should be considered with caution due to some limitations in the study design (small number of sites per location, biogeographic differences associated with the island nature of the MPA, or seasonal variability). Nevertheless, the lax fishing management, the lack of proper implementation (the MPA was established in 2002 without a management plan until 2019), and the small size of the studied MPA may result in ineffective conservation outcomes that could have been reflected in the stable isotopic content of the food web. The large number of “paper park” MPAs existing worldwide are not only detrimental to the perception of marine protection, but also provide poor protection of marine ecosystems. Subject to further studies accounting for both environmental and management factors on stable isotope signatures, trophic interactions can form a cost-effective tool for monitoring MPA effectiveness.","Marine","University of Leeds"

We tagged adult and juvenile gannets at the world's largest colony (Bass Rock) and reviewed two sources of survey data for different age classes to study their movements through southern North Sea waters. Tracked birds showed peak numbers in the southern North Sea in mid-October, with much smaller numbers there during November. Adults were distributed throughout the area, including waters close to OWFs, whereas juveniles were confined to the coast. Survey data indicated high proportions of immature gannets in southern North Sea waters, suggesting higher collision risk than for adults. Gannets present in November may be predominantly from colonies further north than Bass Rock.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Here we demonstrate the feasibility of sampling from commercial vessels (Mediterranean ferries) while underway, as a strategy to facilitate replicable, systematic marine eDNA surveys in locations that would normally be challenging and expensive for researchers to access. Sixteen eDNA samples were collected from four fixed sampling stations, and in response to four cetacean sightings, across three cruises undertaken along the 300 km ferry route between Livorno (Tuscany) and Golfo Aranci (Sardinia) in the Ligurian/Tyrrhenian Seas, June-July 2018. Using 12SrDNA and 16SrDNA metabarcoding markers, we recovered diverse marine vertebrate Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) from teleost fish, elasmobranchs, and cetaceans. We detected sample heterogeneity consistent with previously known variation in species occurrences, including putative species spawning peaks associated with specific sea surface temperature ranges, and increased night time abundance of bathypelagic species known to undertake diel migrations through the water column. We suggest commercial vessel based marine eDNA sampling using the global shipping network has potential to facilitate broad-scale biodiversity monitoring in the world’s oceans.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Controls on the cadmium isotope composition of modern marine sediments.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197429/","Bryan, AL; Dickson, AJ; Dowdall, F","April 2021","Continental margin sediments have been identified as the dominant sink in the marine budget of cadmium (Cd). The isotopic composition of this important output flux is, however, unknown. Here we present, with measurements on the Argentine continental margin, the first observational constraints on the isotopic composition of Cd in modern marine oxic and sub-oxic sediments. We identify two main removal mechanisms of Cd; in organic material, and by sulfide formation. Surface margin sediments (0–0.5 cm), with dissolved O2 below detection from ∼0.5 cm, are isotopically lighter than overlying oxygenated waters. A mass balance for these surface sediments indicates that Cd is present dominantly as organically-bound particulate Cd. In sub-surface sediments, Cd concentrations increase in the zone of nitrate reduction, and attain similar isotopic compositions as the water that overlies the sediment (i.e. ∼0.35‰ in deep waters). These observations are consistent with a downward diffusive flux of seawater Cd and redox-driven quantitative removal of that Cd during sulfide precipitation. In combination, these two routes of Cd removal lead to burial of isotopically light organic Cd in margin sub-oxic sediments that enables the global isotopic Cd budget to be balanced.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Pushing the switch: functional responses and prey switching by invasive lionfish may mediate their ecological impact.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/180380/","McCard, M; South, J; Cuthbert, RN","January 2021","Biodiversity is declining on a global scale and the spread of invasive alien species (IAS) is a major driver, particularly through predatory impacts. Thus, effective means of assessing and predicting the consequences of IAS predation on native prey population stability remains a vital goal for conservation. Here, we applied two classic ecological concepts, consumer functional response (FR) and prey switching, to predict and understand the ecological impacts of juveniles of the lionfish (Pterois volitans), a notorious and widespread marine invader. Functional responses and prey switching propensities were quantified towards three representative prey species: Artemia salina, Palaemonetes varians, and Gammarus oceanicus. Lionfish exhibited potentially destabilising Type II FRs towards individual prey species, owing to high consumption rates at low prey densities, whilst FR magnitudes differed among prey species. Functional response attack rates (a) were highest, and handling times (h) lowest, towards A. salina, followed by P. varians and then G. oceanicus. Maximum feeding rates (1/h) and functional response ratios (FRR; a/h) also followed this impact gradient for the three prey species. Lionfish, however, displayed a potentially population stabilising prey switching propensity (i.e. frequency-dependent predation) when multiple prey species were presented simultaneously, where disproportionately less of rare prey, and more of abundant prey, were consumed. Whilst FR and FRR magnitudes indicate marked per capita lionfish predatory impacts towards prey species, a strong prey switching propensity may reduce in-field impacts by offering low density prey refuge in biodiverse communities. Our results thus corroborate field patterns documenting variable impacts of lionfish, with prey extirpations less likely in diverse communities owing to frequency-dependent predation.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"The benefits of heterogeneity in spatial prioritisation within coral reef environments.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/174376/","Nolan, MKB; Kim, CJS; Hoegh-Guldberg, O","April 2021","Coral reefs are highly vulnerable habitats, threatened by climate change and local anthropogenic impacts. Management is imperative, and spatial prioritisation apportions the area of interest to inform investments of scarce conservation resources. Spatially delineated planning units used to make management decisions are typically large enough to contain significant natural variabilities, but the ecological significance of such variance is seldom considered in planning decisions. On coral reefs, the patchiness of habitat quality within planning units matters both ecologically and functionally. Here, we show that considering within-planning unit variance in spatial prioritisation influences the location and design of reserve networks. Studying Timor-Leste, we statistically model the average and variance in coral cover. We compare conservation priority areas for scenarios informed by coral cover and variance to a baseline scenario with the spatial prioritisation software Marxan. To further explain these differences, and to show the value of including coral variance as a metric in spatial prioritisation, we created a reserve quality score. We show that the similarity between reserve networks was only 57% for protection, and 44% for restoration objectives. For both objectives, the inclusion of cover variance improves the conservation benefit of management. This project has shown a novel way to target areas for restoration. These results demonstrate that not only is mean coral cover (and, by extension, reef condition) a key criterion in selecting marine conservation actions, but its variance must be considered in spatial conservation prioritisation to improve both the efficiency and benefit of management actions within marine reserve networks.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Distinct interspecific and intraspecific vulnerability of coastal species to global change.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/174156/","Nielsen, ES; Henriques, R; Beger, M","April 2021","Characterising and predicting species responses to anthropogenic global change is one of the key challenges in contemporary ecology and conservation. The sensitivity of marine species to climate change is increasingly being described with forecasted species distributions, yet these rarely account for population level processes such as genomic variation and local adaptation. This study compares inter- and intra-specific patterns of biological composition to determine how vulnerability to climate change, and its environmental drivers, vary across species and populations. We compare species trajectories for three ecologically important southern African marine invertebrates at two time points in the future, both at the species level, with correlative species distribution models, and at the population level, with gradient forest models. Reported range shifts are species-specific and include both predicted range gains and losses. Forecasted species responses to climate change are strongly influenced by changes in a suite of environmental variables, from sea surface salinity and sea surface temperature, to minimum air temperature. Our results further suggest a mismatch between future habitat suitability (where species can remain in their ecological niche) and genomic vulnerability (where populations retain their genomic composition), highlighting the inter- and intraspecific variability in species' sensitivity to global change. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of considering species and population level climatic vulnerability when proactively managing coastal marine ecosystems in the Anthropocene.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Experimental evaluation of the extractability of Fe-bound organic carbon in sediments as a function of carboxyl content.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/164864/","Fisher, BJ; Moore, OW; Faust, JC","August 2020","The majority of organic carbon (OC) burial in marine sediments occurs on continental shelves, of which an estimated 10–20% is associated with reactive iron (FeR). The association of OC with FeR (OC-FeR) is thought to facilitate preservation of organic matter (OM) in sediments and therefore represents an important carbon sink. The citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite (CBD) method is used to quantify OC-FeR in marine sediments by reductively dissolving FeR, thereby releasing bound OC. While the CBD method is widely used, it may be less efficient at measuring OC-FeR than currently thought, due to the incomplete reduction of FeR, resulting from the neutral pH conditions required to prevent OM hydrolysis. Additionally, the typical range of values reported for OC-FeR in marine sediments is narrow, despite variation in OM and FeR inputs, OM source types and chemical compositions. This suggests a limitation exists on the amount of OC that can become associated with FeR, and/or that the CBD method is limited in the OC-FeR that it is able to quantify. In assessing the efficiency of the CBD method, we aimed to understand whether methodological errors or (mis)interpretation of these extraction results may contribute to the apparent limitation on OC-FeR values. Here, we synthesised OC-FeR composites with a known FeR phase and known OM moieties, varying in carboxyl content, at neutral pH. These were spiked into OC-free marine sediment, and subject to a CBD extraction to investigate i) the efficiency of CBD for OC extraction; ii) the efficiency of CBD for FeR extraction; ii) how the OC moiety affects the physical parameters of associated FeR minerals; and iii) the impact of OM moiety on OC and Fe release. We show that the CBD method results in only partial dissolution of the most susceptible FeR phase (ferrihydrite) and therefore incomplete removal of bound OC. While as little as ~20% of Fe is released from OC-free ferrihydrite, structural disorder of the mineral phase increases with the inclusion of more OC, resulting in greater losses of up to 62% Fe for carboxyl rich OC-FeR complexes. In addition, our results show that the NaCl control step performed in the CBD method is capable of removing weakly bound OC from FeR, such that inclusion of this OC in the total OC-FeR fraction may increase marine sediments OC-FeR estimates by ~33%. Finally, we suggest that the structure of OC involved in OC-FeR binding can affect quantification of the OC-FeR pool. Our results have important implications for assessing the FeR bound OC fraction in marine sediments and the fate of this OC in the global carbon cycle.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"A review on regulations, current status, effects and reduction strategies of emissions for marine diesel engines.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/164697/","Ni, P; Wang, X; Li, H","June 2020","Marine diesel engines, which provide main power source for ships, mainly contribute to air pollution in ports and coastal areas. Thus there is an increasing demand on tightening the emission standards for marine diesel engines, which necessitates the research on various emission reduction strategies. This review covers emission regulations and emission factors (EFs), environmental effects and available emission reduction solutions for marine diesel engines. Not only the establishment of the emission control areas (ECAs) in the regulations but also many experiments show high concerns about the sulfur limits in fuels, sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Research results reveal that NOx emissions from marine diesel engines account for 50% of total NOx in harbors and coastal regions. Sulfur content in fuel oil is an important parameter index that determines the development direction of emission control technologies. Despites some issues, biodiesel, methanol and liquefied nature gas (LNG) play their important roles in reducing emissions as well as in replacing fossil energy, being promising fuels for marine diesel engines. Fuel-water emulsion (FWE) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) are effective treatment option for NOx emissions control. Common rail fuel injection is an effective fuel injection strategy to achieve simultaneous reductions in particulate matter (PM) and NOx. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and wet scrubbing are the most mature and effective exhaust aftertreatment methods for marine diesel engines, which show 90% De-NOx efficiency and 95% De-SOx efficiency. It can be concluded that the integrated multi-pollutant treatment for ship emissions holds great promise.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Does Arctic warming reduce preservation of organic matter in Barents Sea sediments?","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/162662/","Faust, JC; Stevenson, MA; Abbott, GD","June 2020","Over the last few decades, the Barents Sea experienced substantial warming, an expansion of relatively warm Atlantic water and a reduction in sea ice cover. This environmental change forces the entire Barents Sea ecosystem to adapt and restructure and therefore changes in pelagic–benthic coupling, organic matter sedimentation and long-term carbon sequestration are expected. Here we combine new and existing organic and inorganic geochemical surface sediment data from the western Barents Sea and show a clear link between the modern ecosystem structure, sea ice cover and the organic carbon and CaCO3 contents in Barents Sea surface sediments. Furthermore, we discuss the sources of total and reactive iron phases and evaluate the spatial distribution of organic carbon bound to reactive iron. Consistent with a recent global estimate we find that on average 21.0 ± 8.3 per cent of the total organic carbon is associated to reactive iron (fOC-FeR) in Barents Sea surface sediments. The spatial distribution of fOC-FeR, however, seems to be unrelated to sea ice cover, Atlantic water inflow or proximity to land. Future Arctic warming might, therefore, neither increase nor decrease the burial rates of iron-associated organic carbon. However, our results also imply that ongoing sea ice reduction and the associated alteration of vertical carbon fluxes might cause accompanied shifts in the Barents Sea surface sedimentary organic carbon content, which might result in overall reduced carbon sequestration in the future.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Uranium isotope (U) records from carbonates have recently been used to argue for significant swings in the global marine redox state from the late Neoproterozoic to the early Cambrian. However, geochemical signatures in carbonates—the U isotope archive most commonly employed to argue for redox shifts—are susceptible to diagenetic alteration and may have variable offsets from seawater values. Therefore, there is an impetus to reconstruct seawater U isotopic evolution using another sedimentary archive, in order to verify that these excursions can indeed be linked to global shifts in marine redox landscape. Here we report new U isotope data from two fine-grained siliciclastic upper Ediacaran to lower Cambrian (ca. 551–515 Ma) successions in South China. We find large δ²³⁸U swings between -0.63‰ and +0.39‰ for calculated values of authigenic U in the siliciclastic rocks, consistent with correlative records from the carbonates. The replication of these patterns in both carbonate and siliciclastic units provides confirmatory evidence that the early Cambrian seawater was characterized by highly variable U isotope compositions. These new δ²³⁸U data also provide higher-resolution records of global oceanic redox conditions during Cambrian Age 3, coeval with a critical interval of the Cambrian explosion. These δ²³⁸U data bolster the case that the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition experienced massive swings in marine redox state, providing a dynamic environmental backdrop for and potentially even a key driver of the emergence and radiation of metazoans.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Results of this study are used to critically evaluate the validity of paradigms and models that are routinely used to explain and predict trends in the anatomy and arrangement of parasequences. Data on 957 parasequences from 62 case studies of clastic, shallow‐water successions were coded in a relational database, which includes outcrop and subsurface datasets of ancient and Quaternary examples. These units cover the preserved records of both river‐dominated deltas and wave‐dominated coasts, representing shoreline transits over a breadth of timescales, likely of both local and regional extent. The role of extant accommodation, rates of creation of accommodation and rates of sediment supply in determining parasequence architecture is assessed through analysis of relationships between: (i) proxies of these variables at different scales (rates of aggradation and progradation, facies‐belt shoreline trajectories, systems‐tract type, parasequence‐set stacking patterns, parasequence progradation angle and stratigraphic rise, size of feeder rivers); and (ii) parameters that describe the geometry and stacking style of parasequences, and associated shallow‐water sand bodies. Statistical analyses of database outputs indicate which proxies of accommodation, sediment supply and accommodation/sediment‐supply ratio are significant as predictors of parasequence architecture, and allow for interpretations of the importance of allogenic and autogenic factors. The principal results of this study reveal the following: (i) parasequence thickness varies as a function of water depth, accommodation generation and erosional truncation, and these variations are also reflected across types of systems tracts and parasequence sets; (ii) the dip length of parasequence sand bodies demonstrates scaling with measures of accommodation/sediment‐supply ratio at multiple scales, partly in relation to the possible effect of sediment supply on progradation rates; (iii) in systems tracts, stratigraphic trends in parasequence stacking due to autogenic mechanisms or to acceleration or deceleration in relative sea‐level fluctuations are not revealed quantitatively; (iv) some association is seen between the abundance of deltaic or river‐dominated parasequences and progradational stacking; (v) positive but modest correlation is observed between measures of river‐system size and the dip length of shallow‐marine parasequence sand bodies. The resulting insights can be applied to guide sequence stratigraphic interpretations of the rock record and the characterization of sub‐seismic stratigraphic architectures of subsurface successions.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Carbon isotopes in clastic rocks and the Neoproterozoic carbon cycle.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/154595/","Canfield, DE; Knoll, AH; Poulton, SW","December 2019","It has been proposed that isotopically light inorganic carbon precipitated diagenetically in clastic sediments can explain the large carbon isotopic excursions recorded in Neoproterozoic carbonates. To date, however, the data needed to test this hypothesis have been limited. Here we report the analysis of ca. 540 clastic sedimentary rocks, including shales, siltstones, sandstones and tillites, that span the second half of the Neoproterozoic Era. A diagenetic carbon isotopic overprint does indeed occur in many of the samples; however, when we include our analyses in a carbon isotope mass balance model, they produce only a small effect on mass balance model results. Thus, clastic sedimentary rocks were not a major sink for 13C-depleted carbonate during the Neoproterozoic Era. These results do, however, produce a more accurate carbon mass balance, pointing to a high proportion of total organic carbon burial, compared to total carbon burial, during the late Tonian, Cryogenian, and late Ediacaran Periods. This result suggests a vigorous release of oxygen to the atmosphere. The clastic carbonate record also offers a chemostratigraphic tool. For example, we observe an isotope trend in clastic-hosted carbonates of the Isaac Formation, Windermere Supergroup, that strongly resembles the Shuram-Wonoka isotope anomaly, allowing us to place this previously undated section in a temporal context. We also find isotope trends in the fossiliferous and radiometrically well-dated sedimentary rocks of the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland, that may also reflect the Shuram-Wonoka anomaly. If correct, this constrains the timing of the Shuram event, suggesting that it began after 571 Ma and ended before 562 Ma, with the most extreme isotopic values lying well within those bounds.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Impact of Changes to the Atmospheric Soluble Iron Deposition Flux on Ocean Biogeochemical Cycles in the Anthropocene.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/160674/","Hamilton, DS; Moore, JK; Arneth, A","February 2020","Iron can be a growth‐limiting nutrient for phytoplankton, modifying rates of net primary production, nitrogen fixation, and carbon export ‐ highlighting the importance of new iron inputs from the atmosphere. The bioavailable iron fraction depends on the emission source and the dissolution during transport. The impacts of anthropogenic combustion and land use change on emissions from industrial, domestic, shipping, desert, and wildfire sources suggest that Northern Hemisphere soluble iron deposition has likely been enhanced between 2% and 68% over the Industrial Era. If policy and climate follow the intermediate Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 trajectory, then results suggest that Southern Ocean (>30°S) soluble iron deposition would be enhanced between 63% and 95% by 2100. Marine net primary productivity and carbon export within the open ocean are most sensitive to changes in soluble iron deposition in the Southern Hemisphere; this is predominantly driven by fire rather than dust iron sources. Changes in iron deposition cause large perturbations to the marine nitrogen cycle, up to 70% increase in denitrification and 15% increase in nitrogen fixation, but only modestly impacts the carbon cycle and atmospheric CO2 concentrations (1–3 ppm). Regionally, primary productivity increases due to increased iron deposition are often compensated by offsetting decreases downstream corresponding to equivalent changes in the rate of phytoplankton macronutrient uptake, particularly in the equatorial Pacific. These effects are weaker in the Southern Ocean, suggesting that changes in iron deposition in this region dominates the global carbon cycle and climate response.","Marine","University of Leeds"

There are many commercial salivary substitutes in the market, but none with a long-lasting lubrication effect. Polymer-coated liposomes can be an interesting formulation strategy for retrieving the symptoms of dry mouth by mimicking the micelles of saliva. In the present study, polymer coated-liposomes were prepared by the conventional thin film method and subsequently coated with three different polymers with different charge densities; alginate, chitosan and hydrophobically modified ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose (HM-EHEC). The prepared polymer-coated liposomes were studied concerning their lubricating properties using a ball-on-disc tribometer at 2 N load at 37 °C, and their flow behaviours were also measured. Solutions of the pure polymers and dispersions of the uncoated liposomes were also studied to investigate any contributions from the individual components. A commercial dry mouth product based on HEC (hydroxyethyl cellulose) and glycerol was also included. The formulations were measured as soon as possible after preparation and some of them after >4 weeks. Results demonstrated that all the positively-charged formulations (chitosan, positive liposomes and chitosan-coated liposomes) had superior lubricating properties with friction coefficients (μ < 0.1) at orally relevant speeds (50 mm/s) as compared to the neutral or negatively-charged systems. At boundary lubrication conditions (3 mm/s), the chitosan-coated liposomes obtained an even lower friction force than the individual components, thus indicating a synergistic effect between the polymer and the liposome.","Ai","University of Leeds"

Turbulent secondary flows are found within the pipe, with the curved upper wall affecting the secondary flow formation giving rise to a pair of large upper vortices above two smaller vortices close to the pipe floor. The behavior of the two sizes of particle is found to be quite different. The 50 μm particles deposit forming irregular elongated particle streaks close to the pipe floor, particularly at the center of the flow and the pipe corners due to the impact of the secondary flows. The deposition and resuspension rate of the 5 μm particles is high near the center of the floor and at the pipe corners, while values for the 50 μm particles are greatest near the corners. Near the curved upper wall of the pipe, the deposition rate of the 5 μm particles increases in moving from the wall center to the corners, and is greater than that for the larger particles due to the effects of the secondary flow. The maximum resuspension rate of the smaller particles occurs above the pipe corners, with the 50 μm particles showing their highest resuspension rate above and at the corners of the pipe.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"3D-Net: Monocular 3D object recognition for traffic monitoring.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198466/","Rezaei, M; Azarmi, M; Mohammad Pour Mir, F","April 2023","Machine Learning has played a major role in various applications including Autonomous Vehicles and Intelligent Transportation Systems. Utilizing a deep convolutional neural network, the article introduces a zero-calibration 3D Object recognition and tracking system for traffic monitoring. The model can accurately work on urban traffic cameras, regardless of their technical specification (i.e. resolution, lens, the field of view) and positioning (location, height, angle). For the first time, we introduce a novel satellite-ground inverse perspective mapping technique, which requires no camera calibrations and only needs the GPS position of the camera. This leads to an accurate environmental modeling solution that is capable of estimating road users’ 3D bonding boxes, speed, and trajectory using a monocular camera. We have also contributed to a hierarchical activity/traffic modeling solution using short- and long-term Spatio-temporal video analysis to understand the heatmap of the traffic flow, bottlenecks, and high-risk zones. The experiments are conducted on four datasets: MIO-TCD, UA-DETRAC, GRAM-RTM, and Leeds-Dataset including various use cases and traffic scenarios.","Ai","University of Leeds"

"Robust Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Stochastic Frontier Models.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/194707/","Stead, AD; Wheat, P; Greene, WH","December 2022","When analysing the efficiency of decision-making units, the robustness of efficiency scores to changes in the data is desirable, especially in the context of managerial or regulatory benchmarking. However, the robustness of maximum likelihood estimation of stochastic frontier models remains underexplored. We examine the behaviour of the influence function of the estimator in a stochastic frontier context, and derive some sufficient conditions for robust maximum likelihood estimation in terms of the properties of the marginal distributions of the error components and, in cases where they are dependent, the copula density. We find that the canonical distributional assumptions do not satisfy these conditions. The Student’s t noise distribution is found to have some particularly attractive properties which means it can be paired with a broad class of inefficiency distributions while still satisfying our conditions under independence. We show that parameter estimates and efficiency predictions from robust specifications are significantly less sensitive to contaminating observations than those from non-robust specifications.","Ai","University of Leeds"

However, the fragility of peatland habitats and poor resilience of the specialist plant communities within them, mean that these linear disturbances may persist post-abandonment or post-removal. We removed sections of mesh track, abandoned five years earlier, from a blanket peatland using two different removal treatment methods (mown and unprepared) and studied a third treatment with sections left in place over a period of 19 months. On abandoned tracks, invasive species including Campylopus introflexus and Deschampsia flexulosa had established, while track removal led to extensive loss of Sphagnum species. Loss of surficial nanotopographic vegetation structures during track removal was extensive, and micro-erosion features were prevalent in both removal treatments. Abandoned sections of track performed comparably better across all metrics than removed sections. However, similarity between the vegetation assemblage of the abandoned track and the controls was <40% at the study outset, with NMDS (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling) highlighting divergences. There was a mean species loss of 5 per quadrat for the removed sections. Bare peat was present in 52% of all track quadrats by the finish of the study. Our findings suggest that mesh tracks left in situ and track removal both present significant barriers to recovery and additional conservation interventions may be required after peatland tracks are abandoned.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Structure and dielectric properties of yttrium-doped Ca0.28Ba0.72Nb2O6 ceramics.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198270/","Peirson, H; Pan, J; Li, Y","March 2023","An unfilled tungsten bronze-structured ferroelectric ceramic, Ca0.28Ba0.72Nb2O6 (CBN28), has been doped with Y3+ to produce ceramics with a nominal composition, (Ca0.28Ba0.72)1–3w/2YwNb2O6 [0 ≤ w ≤ 0.05]. The substitution of Y3+ for Ca2+/Ba2+, and consequent additional vacancy formation, is assumed to occur on the A1/A2 sites. This resulted in a minor reduction of the c lattice parameter, and unit cell volume. For undoped CBN28, there was a slightly diffuse relative permittivity-temperature (εr-T) peak at 268 ⁰C. The peak became much broader for sample compositions w = 0.04 and 0.05 and the peak temperature showed a level of frequency dependence consistent with weak relaxor behaviour. The polarisation-electric field loops became narrower for samples w = 0.04 and 0.05, corresponding to a reduction in remnant polarisation value, from 2.4 to 0.8 µC cm−2 (30 kV cm−1). The Y doped ceramics exhibited stable relative permittivity over a wide temperature range, the variation being within± 15% of the median value from 36 ⁰C to 218 ⁰C for w = 0.05, when measured at 1 kHz. Consequently, we suggest that A site donor-doping and aliovalent B site doping of CBN holds potential for industry standard, temperature stable, high temperature dielectrics (ɛr ≥ 500 ± 15% from - 55–250 + ⁰C).","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Energising connections in museum collections.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/193436/","Gooday, G; Little, K; Musesengwe, B","November 2022","The task of inter-connecting artefacts within the broad category of ‘energy’ across multiple heritage collections raises very significant challenges. Energy per se is itself invisible, manifested only in a bewildering diversity of technological mediations of its acquisition, storage or transformation from one form to another (e.g. chemical to thermal, or electrical to motive). And while energy usage via such technology is easily linked to industrial growth and global prosperity, it is also entangled in multiple stories of human and environmental destruction over many centuries, albeit unevenly distributed over social class and global location. How then can the Congruence Engine project draw some coherent stories together from heritage collections that hold energy-related artefacts of so many kinds? Our paper explores how the Congruence Engine’s Energy team will approach this task by taking as our starting point two specific collections of Newcastle’s Discovery Museum: steam turbines and coal mining. Focusing on that particularly convenient pair of preliminary case studies enables us to look ahead to how we can bring the Congruence Engine project’s digital humanities tools more fully to bear in linking such energetic heritage to other (at least part) digitised collections of films, photographs, songs and journals, etc. In so doing, we highlight the need to address the broader cultural landscape of energy, often involving emotional human stories, that bring meaning to museum audiences’ engagement with energy’s material culture. And in contrast to traditional museum narratives of energy history as the technocratic ‘conquering’ of nature, we consider how the Congruence Engine project could help to bring in a complementary approach: memorialising energy history instead as a human drama entangled with many forms of human loss.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Sensitivity Analysis of the Spatial Parameters in Modelling the Evolutionary Interaction Between Autonomous Vehicles and Other Road Users.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/196067/","Bitar, I; Watling, D; Romano, R","January 2023","The road user network is a dynamic, ever-evolving population in which road users interact to share and compete for road space. The advent of autonomous road vehicles (ARVs) will usher in numerous opportunities and challenges in road user dynamics. One of the challenges is whether an ARV population would be able to successfully enter the existing road user space. Previous work demonstrates that successful introduction of ARVs into the road network must consider the evolutionary dynamics of the existing population. This study examines the effect of different spatial parameters as starting conditions for the introduction of a small population of ARVs into a resident population of human-driven vehicles (HDV). The model utilises the concept of evolutionary game theory and uses a square lattice grid with a novel agent mobility approach. The results show that ARV success exhibits significant sensitivity to variations in initial cluster size, position, and travel range. ARVs seem to perform best in fewer, larger clusters with a shorter travel range. This suggests that the best form of early ARV introduction may take the shape of centralised, highly co-operative fleets of local passenger or freight transport.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Understanding the microstructure of a functional meat analogue: Demystifying interactions between fungal hyphae and egg white protein.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197030/","Okeudo-Cogan, MC; Murray, BS; Ettelaie, R","February 2023","This study investigated the microstructure and interactions of heat treated concentrated Fusarium venenatum biomass, commonly referred to as ‘mycoprotein’ (MYC), as well as the impact of 3 wt % egg white protein (EWP) on those interactions – EWP being frequently added as a ‘binding agent’. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM) combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDS) demonstrated the filamentous nature of the MYC, made up of chitin and protein, with a filament aspect ratio typically between 130 and 140. Protein extraction and analysis via SDS-PAGE electrophoresis suggested that the most abundant native protein in the MYC had a molecular weight of 69.2 kDa, probably belonging to the heat shock 70 (HSP70) group. Frequency sweep dynamic shear rheology measurements were performed at combinations of 3 different values of pH (3, 5 and 7), NaCl concentration ([NaCl] = 0, 100 and 200 mM), CaCl2 concentration ([CaCl2] = 0, 50 and 100 mM) and wt. % MYC solids (5, 10, 15 and 20) without added EWP and with added EWP (MYC-EWP). For MYC the storage modulus G′ was seen to increase strongly with increasing wt. % MYC solids but also with [NaCl] and [CaCl2], the latter having greater impact at pH 5 and 7. The opposite trends were observed at pH 3, where G′ decreased with increasing concentration of ions, the highest G′ values for MYC occurring at pH 3 with no added salts. This suggests that electrostatic interactions between the MYC elements are key to the overall texture. On addition of EWP, there was good evidence that EWP completely coats the filaments so that, the hyphal interactions of MYC-EWP are then dominated by the response of EWP to changes in pH and salt composition. Gaining further understanding of the strength and distribution of the loci of these interactions is therefore key to better control of the texture of such meat analogues.","Ai","University of Leeds"

"Improving the ecological and economic performance of agri-environment schemes: Payment by modelled results versus payment for actions.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198450/","Simpson, K; Armsworth, PR; Dallimer, M","April 2023","Researchers and policy-makers have become increasingly interested in re-designing agri-environmental policy to improve both economic efficiency and ecological effectiveness. One idea within this debate has been payments for results (outcomes) rather than payment for actions. Payment for result policies have been argued to have some important advantages, but two key disadvantages are the higher risks faced by landowners, leading to low participation rates; and the potentially high costs of monitoring outcomes. Bartkowski et al. (2021) propose an alternative of payment for modelled results, which claims to avoid these two problems. Our paper provides the first application of this approach to spatially realistic patterns of ecological and economic heterogeneity for farmland biodiversity in England. We compare payment for modelled results findings with approximately equivalent payment for actions schemes intended to deliver increases in the same biodiversity indicators. Key insights are that payment for modelled results delivers superior predicted ecological outcomes for the same budgetary cost as payment for actions, whilst economic surpluses to farmers are also higher.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Methodological lessons for negotiating power, political capabilities, and resilience in research on climate change responses.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197928/","Tschakert, P; Parsons, M; Atkins, E","March 2023","Critical scholarship on the intersection of development pathways and climate change responses highlights the roles of power, agency, social difference, intersecting inequalities, and social justice in shaping people’s resilience in a rapidly transforming world. Yet, how to precisely increase the spaces in which people experiencing marginalisation can address power asymmetries and strengthen their resilience, particularly from a methodological perspective, remains poorly understood. Here, we build on recent insights into political capabilities and their relevance for equitable resilience practice to assess the role research methods play in not only locating political capabilities but also enhancing them in the context of climate resilience. We present the findings from an in-depth analysis of 57 articles, out of a larger set of 200+ papers, that have employed co-learning/cooperative inquiries, participatory action research, participatory methods, workshops, and/or interviews combined with other approaches as most engaging and potentially empowering methods. Methodological insights through this analysis allow us to examine if and how resilience-in-the-making materialises across uneven power relations and often flawed decision-making processes. We show the pervasiveness of power differentials, even in research settings designed to be inclusive, and how disempowering processes in adaptation, mitigation, disaster management, and social transformation further marginalise already disadvantaged actors. At the same time, we illustrate the transformative role of alliances, resistance, shared learning, and sustaining inclusive approaches. Such nuanced insights into best processes as well as detrimental pitfalls are essential for development scholars and practitioners to help anchor deliberative resilience practice in the everyday lives of disadvantaged populations and foster political capabilities for more just climate action and policy.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Generating virtual patients of high-resolution MR angiography from non-angiographic multi-contrast MRIs for In-silico trials.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199255/","Xia, Y; Ravikumar, N; Lassila, T","April 2023","Despite success on multi-contrast MR image synthesis, generating specific modalities remains challenging. Those include Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) that highlights details of vascular anatomy using specialised imaging sequences for emphasising inflow effect. This work proposes an end-to-end generative adversarial network that can synthesise anatomically plausible, high-resolution 3D MRA images using commonly acquired multi-contrast MR images (e.g. T1/T2/PD-weighted MR images) for the same subject whilst preserving the continuity of vascular anatomy. A reliable technique for MRA synthesis would unleash the research potential of very few population databases with imaging modalities (such as MRA) that enable quantitative characterisation of whole-brain vasculature. Our work is motivated by the need to generate digital twins and virtual patients of cerebrovascular anatomy for in-silico studies and/or in-silico trials. We propose a dedicated generator and discriminator that leverage the shared and complementary features of multi-source images. We design a composite loss function for emphasising vascular properties by minimising the statistical difference between the feature representations of the target images and the synthesised outputs in both 3D volumetric and 2D projection domains. Experimental results show that the proposed method can synthesise high-quality MRA images and outperform the state-of-the-art generative models both qualitatively and quantitatively. The importance assessment reveals that T2 and PD-weighted images are better predictors of MRA images than T1; and PD-weighted images contribute to better visibility of small vessel branches towards the peripheral regions. In addition, the proposed approach can generalise to unseen data acquired at different imaging centres with different scanners, whilst synthesising MRAs and vascular geometries that maintain vessel continuity. The results show the potential for use of the proposed approach to generating digital twin cohorts of cerebrovascular anatomy at scale from structural MR images typically acquired in population imaging initiatives.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"A material flow analysis of the UK clothing economy.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198586/","Millward-Hopkins, J; Purnell, P; Baurley, S","April 2023","Historically, clothing accounted for a significant proportion of annual income for most UK citizens, so items were carefully preserved and often passed down through generations. In the 21st century, however, just 40 min of work at minimum wage is sufficient to purchase a dress, shirt, or pair of trousers that may be discarded after a handful of uses. UK per-capita clothing consumption is 2–3 times the global average, reliant on international supply chains associated with many environmental and social issues. Steering the clothing system towards ecological sustainability requires wide-ranging strategies, but the lack of data on flows of clothing makes it difficult to quantify the impacts of current production and consumption, let alone design and evaluate sustainability interventions. Here we use material flow analysis to track clothing flows through the UK economy as a prelude to considering embodied carbon and changes in economic value across the system. Our results show the system is characterised by relatively high rates of reuse but very low rates of recycling. More clothing is destroyed (via landfill and incineration) than is reused and recycled. Consequently, reducing consumption of new clothing by just ∼4% would be as effective for reducing waste as doubling current recycling activity. The UK also imports eight times more clothing than it produces, but offshores over half of the associated textile waste. In our carbon analysis, uncertainty is the key theme – estimates put the cradle-to-consumer emissions associated with 2018 UK clothing consumption anywhere from 9 Mt.CO₂e to over 30 Mt.CO₂e. Our economic analysis shows substantial, but unsurprising losses in economic value of clothing as it flows through the economy, with some unexpected nuances. Improving the accuracy of current flow and impact data is critical for understanding how the clothing system can be most effectively moved towards circularity.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Emerging challenges of the impacts of pharmaceuticals on aquatic ecosystems: A diatom perspective.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197932/","Kock, A; Glanville, HC; Law, AC","March 2023","Pharmaceuticals are a ubiquitous group of emerging pollutants of considerable importance due to their biological potency and potential to elicit effects in wildlife and humans. Pharmaceuticals have been quantified in terrestrial, marine, fresh, and transitional waters, as well as the fauna and macro-flora that inhabit them. Pharmaceuticals can enter water ways through different human and veterinary pathways with traditional wastewater treatment, unable to completely remove pharmaceuticals, discharging often unknown quantities to aquatic ecosystems. However, there is a paucity of available information regarding the effects of pharmaceuticals on species at the base of aquatic food webs, especially on phytoplankton, with research typically focussing on fish and aquatic invertebrates. Diatoms are one of the main classes of phytoplankton and are some of the most abundant and important organisms in aquatic systems. As primary producers, diatoms generate ∼40 % of the world's oxygen and are a vital food source for primary consumers. Diatoms can also be used for bioremediation of polluted water bodies but perhaps are best known as bio-indicators for water quality studies. However, this keystone, non-target group is often ignored during ecotoxicological studies to assess the effects of pollutants of concern. Observed effects of pharmaceuticals on diatoms have the potential to be used as an indicator of pharmaceutical-induced impacts on higher trophic level organisms and wider ecosystem effects. The aim of this review is to present a synthesis of research on pharmaceutical exposure to diatoms, considering ecotoxicity, bioremediation and the role of diatoms as bio-indicators. We highlight significant omissions and knowledge gaps which need addressing to realise the potential role of diatoms in future risk assessment approaches and help evaluate the impacts of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment at local and global scales.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Extending bootstrap AMG for clustering of attributed graphs.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/196373/","D’Ambra, P; Vassilevski, PS; Cutillo, L","February 2023","In this paper we propose a new approach to detect clusters in undirected graphs with attributed vertices. We incorporate structural and attribute similarities between the vertices in an augmented graph by creating additional vertices and edges as proposed in [1, 2]. The augmented graph is then embedded in a Euclidean space associated to its Laplacian and we cluster vertices via a modified K-means algorithm, using a new vector-valued distance in the embedding space. Main novelty of our method, which can be classified as an early fusion method, i.e., a method in which additional information on vertices are fused to the structure information before applying clustering, is the interpretation of attributes as new realizations of graph vertices, which can be dealt with as coordinate vectors in a related Euclidean space. This allows us to extend a scalable generalized spectral clustering procedure which substitutes graph Laplacian eigenvectors with some vectors, named algebraically smooth vectors, obtained by a linear-time complexity Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) method. We discuss the performance of our proposed clustering method by comparison with recent literature approaches and public available results. Extensive experiments on different types of synthetic datasets and real-world attributed graphs show that our new algorithm, embedding attributes information in the clustering, outperforms structure-only-based methods, when the attributed network has an ambiguous structure. Furthermore, our new method largely outperforms the method which originally proposed the graph augmentation, showing that our embedding strategy and vector-valued distance are very effective in taking advantages from the augmented-graph representation.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"A mathematical model for assessing transient airborne infection risks in a multi-zone hospital ward.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198899/","Edwards, AJ; Benson, L; Guo, Z","April 2023","Quantification of the parameters influencing airborne infection risks associated with indoor activities in different settings can help in understanding outbreak dynamics and the effective implementation of mitigation strategies. This is particularly important in hospitals, where the consequence of infections amongst vulnerable individuals can be significant. Despite the transient occupancy and inter-connected nature of hospital wards, the majority of airborne risk models assume steady-state conditions and well-mixed air in a single zone. We propose a multi-zone model with both a fixed and time-varying infectious person. We use an adapted version of the Wells–Riley model to estimate transient airborne virus concentration, and account for time-varying behaviour in the indoor setting. Through a coupling with a CONTAM airflow network model, we incorporate the effects of ventilation patterns on inter-zonal flow rates to represent likely airflow in a realistic hospital ward. We use this approach to explore the difference in predictions from transient versus steady-state models across several scenarios. Results suggest that a steady-state approach could lead to an overestimation of infection risk or underestimation of quanta emission, especially when the infectious person is only present for a short period of time. The difference between models is most apparent in poorly ventilated spaces, illustrating how risks can build over time when infectious occupant movement is more frequent than the removal rate due to ventilation. The model highlights the importance of considering transient factors when assessing infection risks to ensure that the most effective mitigation strategies are implemented to address long and short timescale risks.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Biomass valorization toward sustainable asphalt pavements: Progress and prospects.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199115/","He, L; Tao, M; Liu, Z","March 2023","To cope with the global climate crisis and assist in achieving the carbon neutrality, the use of biomass materials to fully or partially replace petroleum-based products and unrenewable resources is expected to become a widespread solution. Based on the analysis of the existing literature, this paper firstly classified biomass materials with potential application prospects in pavement engineering according to their application and summarized their respective preparation methods and characteristics. The pavement performance of asphalt mixtures with biomass materials was analyzed and summarized, and the economic and environmental benefits of bio-asphalt binder were evaluated. The analysis shows that pavement biomass materials with potential for practical application can be divided into three categories: bio-oil, bio-fiber, and bio-filler. Adding bio-oil to modify or extend the virgin asphalt binder can mostly improve the low temperature performance of asphalt binder. Adding styrene-butadienestyrene (SBS) or other preferable bio-components for composite modification will have a further improved effect. Most of the asphalt mixtures prepared by using bio-oil modified asphalt binders have improved the low temperature crack resistance and fatigue resistance of asphalt mixtures, but the high temperature stability and moisture resistance may decrease. As a rejuvenator, most bio-oils can restore the high and low temperature performance of aged asphalt and recycled asphalt mixture, and improve fatigue resistance. Adding bio-fiber could significantly improve the high temperature stability, low temperature crack resistance and moisture resistance of asphalt mixtures. Biochar as a bio-filler can slow down the asphalt aging process and some other bio-fillers can improve the high temperature stability and fatigue resistance of asphalt binders. Through calculation, it is found that the cost performance of bio-asphalt has the ability to surpass conventional asphalt and has economic benefits. The use of biomass materials for pavements not only reduces pollutants, but also reduces the dependence on petroleum-based products. It has significant environmental benefits and development potential.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Insight into the effect of catalytic reactions on correlations of soot oxidation activity and microspatial structures.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198966/","Huang, J; Wang, S; Gao, J","March 2023","A catalyst is usually coated on Diesel particulate filter (DPF) for assisted regeneration. In this paper, the oxidation activity and pore structure evolutions of soot under the effect of CeO2 are explored. CeO2 effectively increases the oxidation activity of soot and reduces the initial activation energy; in the meantime, the addition of CeO2 changes the soot oxidation mode. Pure soot particles tend to produce the porous structure in the oxidation process. Mesopores promote the diffusion of oxygen, and macropores contribute to reduce the agglomeration of soot particles. Additionally, CeO2 provides the active oxygen for soot oxidation and promotes the multi-point oxidation at the beginning of soot oxidation. With the oxidation proceeding, catalysis causes the collapsion of soot microspatial structures, in the meantime, the macropores caused by the catalytic oxidation are filled by CeO2. It results in the tight contact between soot and catalyst, further promoting the formation of the available active oxygen for soot oxidation. This paper is meaningful to analyze the oxidation mechanism of soot under catalysis, which lays a foundation for improving the regeneration efficiency of DPF and reducing the particle emission.","Ai","University of Leeds"

The aim of this preliminary study was to examine the effect of an acute aquatic exercise session on energy intake (EI), appetite feelings and food reward in adolescents with obesity. Twelve adolescents with obesity (12–16 years, Tanner stage 3–5, 9 males) randomly completed two conditions: i) control (CON); ii) aquatic exercise session (AQUA). One hour before lunch, the adolescents stayed at rest outside the water in a quiet room for 45 min on CON while they performed a 45-min aquatic exercise session on AQUA. Ad libitum EI and macronutrients were assessed at lunch and dinner, subjective appetite feelings taken at regular intervals, and food reward measured before and after lunch. Paired T-test showed that EI was not different between CON and AQUA at lunch (1333 ± 484 kcal vs 1409 ± 593 kcal; p = 0.162) and dinner (528 ± 218 kcal vs 513 ± 204 kcal; p = 0.206). Total daily ad libitum EI was significantly higher on AQUA (1922 ± 649 kcal) compared with CON (1861 ± 685 kcal; p = 0.044) but accounting for the exercise-induced energy expenditure, relative energy intake did not differ (2263 ± 732 kcal vs 2117 ± 744 kcal, p = 0.304). None of the appetite feelings (hunger, fullness, prospective food consumption and desire to eat) and food reward dimensions were significantly different between conditions. These preliminary and exploratory results suggest that an acute aquatic-exercise session might not induce energy compensatory responses in adolescents with obesity.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Wear and deformation of metal-on-polyethylene hip bearings under edge loading conditions due to variations in component positioning.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197402/","Ali, M; Al-Hajjar, M; Fisher, J","March 2023","Despite the clinical success of hip joint replacement, the risk of revision, particularly in younger and more active patients, still remains a concern. To identify conditions of high wear, fatigue and potential failure modes, there is need to be able to replicate a range of in vivo conditions with pre-clinical testing methods in order to predict the range of clinical wear. In particular, edge loading of metal-on-polyethylene hip replacements has the potential to have impact on both surface wear and fatigue failure. The mode of edge loading explored in this study involves separation of the centres of the femoral head and acetabular cup during a portion of the gait cycle. Such edge loading can occur due to variations in translational and/or rotational positioning of the hip replacement. In this study, the influence of translational positioning along the medial-lateral axis (medial-lateral translational mismatch) combined with rotational positioning of the acetabular cup about the anterior-posterior axis (cup inclination angle) on the occurrence and severity of edge loading, and wear and plastic deformation, was investigated for size 36 mm metal-on-polyethylene total hip replacements on a ProSim EM13 electromechanical hip joint simulator. A two phase approach was used; a short term study where the mechanics of the hip bearing were assessed under a wide range of input conditions (45° and 65° cup inclination angle and 1, 2, 3, 4 mm medial-lateral translational mismatch); followed by wear simulation for a lower number of conditions.","Ai","University of Leeds"

Wide-area event identification (WAEI) is considered an indispensable enabling block to these advanced applications. This paper is aimed at scrutinizing existing WAEI methods and discussing their prospects and shortcomings in improving the situational awareness of complex transmission systems. The disturbances of interest are those that significantly impact system operation and stability, namely short-circuit faults, line outages, and generation outages. The reluctance of system operators to entrust WAEI methods is discussed and linked to the inability of existing methods to deal with real-world challenges such as communication latencies, temporarily incomplete network observability, and the loss of the time synchronization signal. The superimposed-circuit concept is detailed and promoted as a powerful methodology with great unleashed potential for addressing these problems. The paper ends with remarks on the remaining research gaps that need to be addressed to fulfill the needs of power system operators, thus facilitating the uptake of WAEI methods in practice.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"The income elasticity of the value of travel time savings: A meta-analysis.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198772/","Binsuwadan, J; Wardman, M; De Jong, G","March 2023","The value of travel time savings (VTTS) is an important concept used in cost-benefit analyses for project appraisals and demand modelling in the transport sector. The relationship between the VTTS and income is particularly important since it underpins how official VTTS recommendations are uplifted over time as incomes grow. The income elasticity of VTTS has been investigated in many empirical studies, exhibiting considerable variation across them. Notably, repeat studies tend to find the lowest implied income effects and meta-analyses the largest income elasticities, with those obtained from cross-sectional inter-personal comparisons somewhere between. This paper aims to explain the VTTS variation in terms of an individual's or household's income level by using the meta-analysis technique. The analysis covers 268 income elasticities of the VTTS extracted from 49 studies conducted from 1968 to 2019 in countries across the globe. The meta-analysis method determines the factors that influence these income elasticity variations. The results of the meta-model highlight that the variation of the income elasticity is explained by several factors, including income levels, the transport mode, personal or household income, inter-temporal or cross-sectional elasticity, journey purpose and year of the survey, shedding light on how the VTTS income elasticity varies across different sources.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Early stages of trench-slope basin development: Insights from mass-transport deposits and their interactions with turbidite systems (southern Hikurangi margin, New Zealand).","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198760/","Claussmann, B; Bailleul, J; Chanier, F","February 2023","Geological complexity, progressive tectonic overprint and prevailing submarine location of subduction margins generally hinder investigating the early stages of development of their oldest trench-slope basins, witnesses of subduction initiation and early history. Along the eastern North Island of New Zealand, the inner portion of the Hikurangi subduction wedge is emerged, thereby offering a unique opportunity to examine, at outcrop-scale, the tectonostratigraphic evolution of a trench-slope basin (Castlepoint trench-slope basin) that was linked to the onset of subduction. We present new occurrences of lowermost Miocene gravity-driven systems, suggesting a more intricate depositional framework to the ones previously inferred during this key period. Results show that the early stages of development of a trench-slope basin coeval with the birth of a subduction margin may deviate from traditional models either comprising (1) sustainable sediment sources connected to the basin very early in the history of the margin and (2) a sedimentation-deformation feedback mechanism promoting the long-term development of an aggradational turbidite system downslope. Analysis of the mass-transport deposits (MTDs) also revealed that the outboard migration of deformation was discontinuous and uneven along the margin during the earliest Miocene. Two major tectonic events, separated by a period of reduced tectonic activity, were recorded at the inboard border of the Castlepoint trench-slope basin, each resulting in seaward motion, oversteepening and frontal denudation of a thrust sheet. Each thrust sheet provided contrasting failed material and morphometric characteristics to the associated deposits, thereby allowing us to discriminate the nature of the nappe and related controls responsible for shedding each MTD as well as refine the timing of nappe emplacement along this part of the margin. Overall, this study draws new insights on the early structural evolution and stratigraphic infill during the birth of subduction zones, insights which may, in turn, help improve understandings of active margin settings.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"A Cautionary Tale: examples of the mis-location of small earthquakes beneath the Tibetan plateau by routine approaches.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/195463/","Craig, TJ; Jackson, J; Priestley, K","January 2023","Earthquake moment tensors and centroid locations in the catalogue of the Global CMT (gCMT) project, formerly the Harvard CMT project, have become an essential resource for studying active global tectonics, used by many solid-Earth researchers. The catalogue’s quality, long duration (1976–present), ease of access and global coverage of earthquakes larger than about Mw 5.5 have transformed our ability to study regional patterns of earthquake locations and focal mechanisms. It also allows researchers to easily identify earthquakes with anomalous mechanisms and depths that stand out from the global or regional patterns, some of which require us to look more closely at accepted interpretations of geodynamics, tectonics or rheology. But, as in all catalogues that are, to some extent and necessarily, produced in a semi-routine fashion, the catalogue may contain anomalies that are in fact errors. Thus, before re-assessing geodynamic, tectonic or rheological understanding on the basis of anomalous earthquake locations or mechanisms in the gCMT catalogue, it is first prudent to check those anomalies are real. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate that necessity in the eastern Himalayas and SE Tibet, where two earthquakes that would otherwise require a radical revision of current geodynamic understanding are shown, in fact, to have gCMT depths (and, in one case, also focal mechanism) that are incorrect.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Six-degree-of-freedom Localization Under Multiple Permanent Magnet Actuation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198193/","Da Veiga, T; Pittiglio, G; Brockdorff, M","March 2023","Localization of magnetically actuated medical robots is essential for accurate actuation, closed loop control and delivery of functionality. Despite extensive progress in the use of magnetic field and inertial measurements for pose estimation, these have been either under single external permanent magnet actuation or coil systems. With the advent of new magnetic actuation systems comprised of multiple external permanent magnets for increased control and manipulability, new localization techniques are necessary to account for and leverage the additional magnetic field sources. In this letter, we introduce a novel magnetic localization technique in the Special Euclidean Group SE(3) for multiple external permanent magnetic field actuation and control systems. The method relies on a milli-meter scale three-dimensional accelerometer and a three-dimensional magnetic field sensor and is able to estimate the full 6 ∘ -of-freedom pose without any prior pose information. We demonstrated the localization system with two external permanent magnets and achieved localization errors of 8.5 ± 2.4 mm in position norm and 3.7 ± 3.6 ∘ in orientation, across a cubic workspace with 20 cm length.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Courage, Honour, and Phlegm: A Study of Eighteenth‐Century Military Writers' Descriptions of Soldiers' Combat Emotions and Motivation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199101/","Dodson, S","March 2023","This article will aim to cover military writers' comments upon the psychological, emotional, and motivational aspects of soldiers in the eighteenth century. In recent years, there has been a positive re-evaluation of the Ancien Régime soldier compared with that of the later citizen soldier of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. This article seeks to add to this re-appraisal by introducing a literature element to the discussion, highlighting and analysing the many passages writers wrote on these psychological topics, such as the fear of death in combat, the world of honour governing the soldier, and nationalistic differences in temperament.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Inverse problems of damped wave equations with Robin boundary conditions: an application to blood perfusion.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198035/","Fang, Y-L; Lesnic, D; Alosaimi, M","April 2023","Knowledge of the properties of biological tissues is essential in monitoring any abnormalities that may be forming and have a major impact on organs malfunctioning. Therefore, these disorders must be detected and treated early to save lives and improve the general health. Within the framework of thermal therapies, e.g. hyperthermia or cryoablation, the knowledge of the tissue temperature and of the blood perfusion rate are of utmost importance. Therefore, motivated by such a significant biomedical application, this paper investigates, for the first time, the uniqueness and stable reconstruction of the space-dependent (heterogeneous) perfusion coefficient in the thermal-wave hyperbolic model of bio-heat transfer from Cauchy boundary data using the powerful technique of Carleman estimates. Additional novelties consist in the consideration of Robin boundary conditions, as well as developing a mathematical analysis that leads to stronger stability estimates valid over a shorter time interval than usually reported in the literature of coefficient identification problems for hyperbolic partial differential equations. Numerically, the inverse coefficient problem is recast as a nonlinear least-squares minimization that is solved using the conjugate gradient method (CGM). Both exact and noisy data are inverted. To achieve stability, the CGM is stopped according to the discrepancy principle. Numerical results for a physical example are presented and discussed, showing the convergence, accuracy and stability of the inversion procedure.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Tribo-induced catalytically active oxide surfaces enabling the formation of the durable and high-performance carbon-based tribofilms.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198046/","Huynh, KK; Pham, ST; Tieu, AK","April 2023","Carbon-containing tribofilms have attracted significant interest in the lubrication research despite a scarcity of information on their high-temperature performance under severe boundary conditions. In this study, high-temperature lubrication of the carbon tribofilm produced from cyclopropane carboxylic acid (CPCa) and NiAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles was evaluated. NiAl-LDH nanoparticles significantly enhanced the friction stability and antiwear performance of CPCa by over 90% at 50°C and 100°C, comparable to the benchmark zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZDDPs). The highly graphitic amorphous carbon tribofilms and the fine-grain intermediate tribolayer constructed by the thermal decomposition products of NiAl-LDH contributed to such excellent lubrication performance. This study paves a pathway in developing functional anti-wear additives for the durable and high-performance carbon-containing tribofilms at high temperatures.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"A Magnetically-Actuated Coiling Soft Robot with Variable Stiffness.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197919/","Lloyd, P; Thomas, TL; Venkiteswaran, VK","March 2023","Soft and flexible magnetic robots have gained significant attention in the past decade. These robots are fabricated using magnetically-active elastomers, are capable of large deformations, and are actuated remotely thus allowing for small robot size. This combination of properties is appealing to the minimally invasive surgical community, potentially allowing navigation to regions of the anatomy previously deemed inaccessible. Due to the low forces involved, one particular challenge is functionalizing such magnetic devices. To address this limitation we introduce a proof-of-concept variable stiffness robot controlled by remote magnetic actuation, capable of grasping objects of varying sizes. We demonstrate a controlled and reversible high deformation coiling action induced via a transient homogeneous magnetic field and a synchronized sliding nitinol backbone. Our soft magnetic coiling grasper is visually tracked and controlled during three experimental demonstrations. We exhibit a maximum coiling deformation angle of 400◦.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Polarization and Consensus in a Voter Model under Time-Fluctuating Influences.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199060/","Mobilia, M","April 2023","We study the effect of time-fluctuating social influences on the formation of polarization and consensus in a three-party community consisting of two types of voters (“leftists” and “rightists”) holding extreme opinions, and moderate agents acting as “centrists”. The former are incompatible and do not interact, while centrists hold an intermediate opinion and can interact with extreme voters. When a centrist and a leftist/rightist interact, they can become either both centrists or both leftists/rightists. The population eventually either reaches consensus with one of the three opinions, or a polarization state consisting of a frozen mixture of leftists and rightists. As a main novelty, here agents interact subject to time-fluctuating external influences favouring in turn the spread of leftist and rightist opinions, or the rise of centrism. The fate of the population is determined under various scenarios, and it is shown how the rate of change of external influences can drastically affect the polarization and consensus probabilities, as well as the mean time to reach the final state.","Ai","University of Leeds"
