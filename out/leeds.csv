"Gaps in academic literature on venture capitalists’ decision-making on funding for early-stage, high-tech ventures.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/94498/","Brusche, LA","January 2016","Recognizing venture capital as a crucial source of funds for life science start-ups, this review paper focuses on the academic literature on venture capitalists’ decision-making process on granting funding to early-stage, high-tech ventures. This review identified the following three issues: First, despite three dominant factors in venture capitalists’ decision-making process, which are identified to be the human, technological and financial aspects of the potential start-up, a great variety of further factors exists and generalization to a great extent is difficult. Secondly, little research has been conducted in Europe and little research employed inductive, qualitative methods. Thirdly, the latest study focusing on a ranking of the importance of decision-making factors for venture capitalists lies 29 years in the past and has been conducted with a North-American sample, leaving a gap for future research in Europe.","Tech","University of Leeds"
"An approach for assessing and ranking fisheries management scenarios in spatially delimited marine areas.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198591/","Clare, DS; Martinez, R; Goodsir, F","February 2023","Spatial restrictions to human activities such as bottom trawling are increasingly used to improve the ecological condition of disturbed habitats. Such management interventions typically have socio-economic consequences, which creates a challenge for those making decisions about which activities should be restricted and where restrictions should apply. We present an approach for predicting the effects of fisheries management scenarios in spatially delimited marine areas and ranking them—using a loss function—according to how well they achieve desired outcomes across a set of ecological and socio-economic indicators. This approach is demonstrated by simulating alternative fishing gear restrictions and zoning options within a hypothetical marine protected area (MPA). Relative benthic status (RBS; an indicator of ecological condition) and relative catch value (RCV; an indicator of potential economic cost) were estimated for the baseline environment and 21 potential management scenarios. The rank order depended on which indicator was prioritized (i.e. whether RBS or RCV was given greater weighting in the loss function), with the top-ranked scenarios in each case involving considerably different management measures. The methods presented can be applied anywhere using locally or strategically relevant indicators to help identify spatial fisheries management measures that minimize ecological and socio-economic trade-offs.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Diversification of refugia types needed to secure the future of coral reefs subject to climate change.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200546/","McClanahan, TR; Darling, ES; Beger, M","April 2023","Identifying locations of refugia from the thermal stresses of climate change for coral reefs and better managing them is one of the key recommendations for climate change adaptation. We review and summarize approximately 30 years of applied research focused on identifying climate refugia to prioritize the conservation actions for coral reefs under rapid climate change. We found that currently proposed climate refugia and the locations predicted to avoid future coral losses are highly reliant on  excess heat metrics, such as degree heating weeks. However, many existing alternative environmental, ecological, and life-history variables could be used to identify other types of refugia that lead to the desired diversified portfolio for coral reef conservation. To improve conservation priorities for coral reefs, there is a need to evaluate and validate the predictions of climate refugia with long-term field data on coral abundance, diversity, and functioning. There is also the need to identify and safeguard locations displaying resistance toprolonged exposure to heat waves and the ability to recover quickly after thermal exposure. We recommend using more metrics to identify a portfolio of potential refugia sites for coral reefs that can avoid, resist, and recover from exposure to high ocean temperatures and the consequences of climate change, thereby shifting past efforts focused on avoidance to a diversified risk-spreading portfolio that can be used to improve strategic coral reef conservation in a rapidly warming climate.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Exposure of wild Caspian seals (Pusa caspica) to parasites, bacterial and viral pathogens, evaluated via molecular and serological assays.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197640/","Kydyrmanov, A; Karamendin, K; Kasymbekov, Y","March 2023","Disease surveillance of marine mammal populations is essential to understand the causes of strandings, identify potential threats to animal health, and to support development of conservation strategies. Here we report the first large multi-pathogen screening of prevalence for viruses, bacteria and parasites in a sample of 177 live, healthy, wild Caspian seals (Pusa caspica), captured and released during satellite telemetry studies 2007-2017. Employing molecular and serological assays we assess prevalence of pathogens known to be of significance for marine mammal health worldwide, and evaluate the results in relation to Caspian seal health and conservation. RT-PCR, and PCR assays find evidence for infection by Canine Distemper Virus (CDV), Phocine herpes virus, phocine adenovirus and Influenza A at prevalences of 5%, 6.4%, 21.7%, and 4% respectively. The genomes of CDV isolates collected in 2008 showed 99.59% identity with the 2000 Caspian seal CDV epizootic strain. A partial coding sequence for the Us2 gene from the Caspian seal herpes virus was identical to PhHV-1 isolate PB84, previously reported from a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), while amplicon sequences for the adenovirus polymerase gene indicated a novel strain. ELISA assays detected exposure to Influenza A (55% of tested samples), adenovirus (25%), coronavirus (6%), CDV (8%), herpes virus (94%), Toxoplasma gondii (2.6%) and heartworm (1%). Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests detected exposure to Influenza B at a prevalence of 20%, and Leptospira microscopic agglutination tests detected suspected exposure to Leptospira serovars in 9% of tested samples. Overall, the risks, profile and prevalence of pathogens in Caspian seals appear comparable to other wild phocid seal populations. Our results suggest Caspian seals have exposure pathways to pathogens with epizootic potential or ability to cause significant morbidity, and disease impacts could reduce the resilience of the population to other conservation threats. Caspian seals are listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and we recommend that resources are invested to support further surveillance programmes and to understand how anthropogenic pressures may influence future disease risks.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Sampling from commercial vessel routes can capture marine biodiversity distributions effectively.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/195840/","Boyse, E; Beger, M; Valsecchi, E","January 2023","Collecting fine-scale occurrence data for marine species across large spatial scales is logistically challenging but is important to determine species distributions and for conservation planning. Inaccurate descriptions of species ranges could result in designating protected areas with inappropriate locations or boundaries. Optimizing sampling strategies therefore is a priority for scaling up survey approaches using tools such as environmental DNA (eDNA) to capture species distributions. In a marine context, commercial vessels, such as ferries, could provide sampling platforms allowing access to undersampled areas and repeatable sampling over time to track community changes. However, sample collection from commercial vessels could be biased and may not represent biological and environmental variability. Here, we evaluate whether sampling along Mediterranean ferry routes can yield unbiased biodiversity survey outcomes, based on perfect knowledge from a stacked species distribution model (SSDM) of marine megafauna derived from online data repositories. Simulations to allocate sampling point locations were carried out representing different sampling strategies (random vs regular), frames (ferry routes vs unconstrained), and number of sampling points. SSDMs were remade from different sampling simulations and compared with the “perfect knowledge” SSDM to quantify the bias associated with different sampling strategies. Ferry routes detected more species and were able to recover known patterns in species richness at smaller sample sizes better than unconstrained sampling points. However, to minimize potential bias, ferry routes should be chosen to cover the variability in species composition and its environmental predictors in the SSDMs. The workflow presented here can be used to design effective sampling strategies using commercial vessel routes globally for eDNA and other biodiversity survey techniques. This approach has potential to provide a cost-effective method to access remote oceanic areas on a regular basis and can recover meaningful data on spatiotemporal biodiversity patterns.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"A response to community questions on the Marine20 radiocarbon age calibration curve: marine reservoir ages and the calibration of ¹⁴C samples from the oceans.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199958/","Heaton, TJ; Bard, E; Bronk Ramsey, C","November 2022","Radiocarbon (14C) concentrations in the oceans are different from those in the atmosphere. Understanding these ocean-atmospheric 14C differences is important both to estimate the calendar ages of samples which obtained their 14C in the marine environment, and to investigate the carbon cycle. The Marine20 radiocarbon age calibration curve is created to address these dual aims by providing a global-scale surface ocean record of radiocarbon from 55,000–0 cal yr BP that accounts for the smoothed response of the ocean to variations in atmospheric 14C production rates and factors out the effect of known changes in global-scale palaeoclimatic variables. The curve also serves as a baseline to study regional oceanic 14C variation. Marine20 offers substantial improvements over the previous Marine13 curve. In response to community questions, we provide a short intuitive guide, intended for the lay-reader, on the construction and use of the Marine20 calibration curve. We describe the choices behind the making of Marine20, as well as the similarities and differences compared with the earlier Marine calibration curves. We also describe how to use the Marine20 curve for calibration and how to estimate ΔR—the localized variation in the oceanic 14C levels due to regional factors which are not incorporated in the global-scale Marine20 curve. To aid understanding, illustrative worked examples are provided.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Shallow- and deep-ocean Fe cycling and redox evolution across the Pliensbachian–Toarcian boundary and Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event in Panthalassa.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/194241/","Chen, W; Kemp, DB; He, T","December 2022","The late Pliensbachian to early Toarcian was characterized by major climatic and environmental changes, encompassing the early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE, or Jenkyns Event, ∼183 Ma) and the preceding Pliensbachian–Toarcian boundary event (Pl/To). Information on seawater redox conditions through this time interval has thus far come mainly from European sections deposited in hydrographically restricted basins, and hence our understanding of the redox evolution of the open ocean (and in particular Panthalassa – the largest ocean to have existed) is limited. Here, we present high-resolution Fe-speciation and redox-sensitive trace metal data from two Panthalassic Ocean sections across the Pl/To and the T-OAE intervals, one deposited in deep water (paleo-water depth >∼2.7 km) and the other on a shallow margin (paleo-water depth likely <∼50 m). Data from the deep-water open-ocean site indicate anoxic-ferruginous conditions from the late Pliensbachian to the onset of the T-OAE, with a rather fluctuating redox state alternating between oxic and anoxic/euxinic conditions across the Pl/To boundary. At least intermittent bottom-water euxinia characterized the T-OAE, followed by a subsequent transition toward more oxygenated conditions. By contrast, trace metal data from the shallow margin site indicate that oxygenated to possibly suboxic conditions prevailed. However, elevated highly reactive iron contents, dominated by Fe (oxyhydr)oxides, characterize this shallow-water site. These observations suggest that upwelling, driven in part by increased sea level and prevailing winds from the open ocean, brought anoxic-ferruginous waters onto the shelf, whereupon Fe2+ oxidation was initiated in oxic shallow waters.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Unifying approaches to Functional Marine Connectivity for improved marine resource management: the European SEA-UNICORN COST Action.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/196337/","Darnaude, AM; Arnaud-Haond, S; Hunter, E","December 2022","Truly sustainable development in a human-altered, fragmented marine environment subject to unprecedented climate change, demands informed planning strategies in order to be successful. Beyond a simple understanding of the distribution of marine species, data describing how variations in spatio-temporal dynamics impact ecosystem functioning and the evolution of species are required. Marine Functional Connectivity (MFC) characterizes the flows of matter, genes and energy produced by organism movements and migrations across the seascape. As such, MFC determines the ecological and evolutionary interdependency of populations, and ultimately the fate of species and ecosystems. Gathering effective MFC knowledge can therefore improve predictions of the impacts of environmental change and help to refine management and conservation strategies for the seas and oceans. Gathering these data are challenging however, as access to, and survey of marine ecosystems still presents significant challenge. Over 50 European institutions currently investigate aspects of MFC using complementary methods across multiple research fields, to understand the ecology and evolution of marine species. The aim of SEA-UNICORN, a COST Action supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology), is to bring together this research effort, unite the multiple approaches to MFC, and to integrate these under a common conceptual and analytical framework. The consortium brings together a diverse group of scientists to collate existing MFC data, to identify knowledge gaps, to enhance complementarity among disciplines, and to devise common approaches to MFC. SEA-UNICORN will promote co-working between connectivity practitioners and ecosystem modelers to facilitate the incorporation of MFC data into the predictive models used to identify marine conservation priorities. Ultimately, SEA-UNICORN will forge strong forward-working links between scientists, policy-makers and stakeholders to facilitate the integration of MFC knowledge into decision support tools for marine management and environmental policies.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Integrating larval connectivity into the marine conservation decision-making process across spatial scales.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/194659/","Muenzel, D; Critchell, K; Cox, C","October 2022","Larval dispersal connectivity is typically integrated into spatial conservation decisions at regional or national scales, but implementing agencies struggle with translating these methods to local scales. We used larval dispersal connectivity at regional (hundreds of kilometers) and local (tens of kilometers) scales to aid in design of networks of no-take reserves in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. We used Marxan with Connectivity informed by biophysical larval dispersal models and remotely sensed coral reef habitat data to design marine reserve networks for 4 commercially important reef species across the region. We complemented regional spatial prioritization with decision trees that combined network-based connectivity metrics and habitat quality to design reserve boundaries locally. Decision trees were used in consensus-based workshops with stakeholders to qualitatively assess site desirability, and Marxan was used to identify areas for subsequent network expansion. Priority areas for protection and expected benefits differed among species, with little overlap in reserve network solutions. Because reef quality varied considerably across reefs, we suggest reef degradation must inform the interpretation of larval dispersal patterns and the conservation benefits achievable from protecting reefs. Our methods can be readily applied by conservation practitioners, in this region and elsewhere, to integrate connectivity data across multiple spatial scales.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"The inclusion of fisheries and tourism in marine protected areas to support conservation in Indonesia.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/195324/","Tranter, SN; Estradivari; Ahmadia, GN","September 2022","With the rapid growth of Indonesia’s marine protected area (MPAs) estate in Indonesia, reaching 23.9 million hectares by January 2020, attention needs to be focused on strengthening the effectiveness of MPA management. Consolidating and expanding protection of Indonesia’s marine resources is critical with increasing pressure from a fast-expanding population, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, pollution, coastal development, unsustainable tourism and climate change. Biodiversity conservation must therefore concurrently consider multiple economic sectors such as fisheries and tourism, and their synergies with MPA management. This paper aims to outline the current landscape of fisheries and marine tourism pertaining to area-based conservation in Indonesia, to inform and support improved integration into effective MPA management. Four areas to focus efforts were identified: diversification of governance types of community-based management, improved coordination between fisheries and MPAs during planning and management implementation, the development and support of pathways for sustainable tourism, and planning for future conditions. Sustainable development for fisheries and tourism must be incorporated into all aspects of MPA management, whilst recognising that current management systems are insufficient to ensure long-term sustainability for natural resources and local communities, and strategies need to increase resilience of social-ecological systems in anticipation of future conditions.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Enabling the informal recycling sector to prevent plastic pollution and deliver an inclusive circular economy.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/192223/","Velis, CA; Hardesty, BD; Cottom, JW","September 2022","Recycling by the informal sector provides a rapid, inexpensive solution to plastic pollution, whilst supporting the livelihoods via their inclusion and empowerment. This solution will have the greatest benefit to the environment if supporting interventions are targeted at types of plastic pollution that are the most damaging from an ecological and wider risk perspective. Interventions should target three aspects of the pollution: reducing barriers to collection, improving the revenue from the materials and wider informal recycler remuneration, and increasing the quality of the materials. Done well, these interventions will increase the collection rate, reduce pollution from plastics, and help millions of people escape poverty. They present a scalable international solution to a global challenge; and are likely the only viable solution to the widespread lack of solid waste services and infrastructure across low- and middle-income countries.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Dynamic ocean redox conditions during the end-Triassic mass extinction: Evidence from pyrite framboids.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/194884/","Li, J; Song, H; Tian, L","October 2022","The end-Triassic (∼201 Mya) records one of the five largest mass extinction events of the Phanerozoic. Extinction losses were coincident with large igneous province volcanism in the form of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) and major carbon isotope excursions (CIEs), suggesting a link between these phenomena. Marine anoxia has been implicated as a causal factor in the crisis, but there remains some uncertainty regarding the role of marine redox changes in marine extinction phases because both intensity and duration of marine anoxia are poorly constrained. We employ high resolution pyrite framboid size-frequency analysis at two Triassic-Jurassic (Tr-J) boundary sections: Kuhjoch in Austria (the Tr-J Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point; GSSP) and St. Audrie's Bay in England (former GSSP candidate) in order to further evaluate the role of marine anoxia in the end-Triassic mass extinction (ETME). The St. Audrie's Bay section records predominantly anoxic conditions punctuated by weakly oxygenated (dysoxic) conditions through the Tr-J transition, even during shallow-water intervals. Kuhjoch experienced both anoxic and dysoxic conditions during the ETME but became better oxygenated near the Tr-J boundary. Marine anoxia is therefore implicated in the extinction at both locations. A similar redox history is known from the Central European Basin, Western Tethys and Panthalassa, where marine anoxia developed in the lead up to the ETME prior to reoxygenation around the Tr-J boundary.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Alleviating impacts of climate change on fishing communities using weather information to improve fishers’ resilience.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/193695/","Okeke-Ogbuafor, N; Taylor, A; Dougill, A","October 2022","This study contributes new knowledge in evaluating actions aimed at alleviating impacts of climate change on small-scale fishers and enhancing resilience in their households in West Africa. Evidence of the damage caused by climate change to the artisanal fisheries sector in West African countries is accumulating. Current measures in place for artisanal fishers to adapt to these changes include broad long-term pro-poor strategies designed to manage the persistent problem of overfishing and declining fish stocks. However, one immediate coping strategy is beginning to emerge, the more active use of reliable weather information. Based on 80 semi-structured interviews conducted in Senegal, Ghana, and Nigeria between 2021 and 2022, this study investigates claims that the use of weather information (WI) is helping West African artisanal fishers and those involved in secondary fishery activities to build more climate-resilient household income and food security. Unlike the long-term measures for mitigating the impact of climate change, results from the study show that by assessing the risk, their marine capture activities using weather information, fishers are immediately benefitting. Using the diffusion of the innovation theory to investigate the pattern of fishers’ adoption and usage of weather information, we found that Senegalese marine artisanal fishers can be classified as “Early Adopters” of this innovation. However, this is not the case with inland fishers who remain skeptical and will only use weather information if they can ascertain its reliability. West Africa’s inland fisheries sector is often neglected in climate change strategies: there is a lack of coordinated action to understand the weather information needs of these vulnerable fishers in order to coassess and codevelop bespoke weather products that offer benefits to them. However, West Africa’s fisheries, especially those inland, are too important to ignore if the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), including no poverty and zero hunger, are to be achieved. To help this sector fully benefit from the use of weather information, this study recommends detailed research into the weather information needs of these fishers and user-friendly ways to engage with the fishers to transmit the information.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Short-takeoff marine vehicle with circulation flow control of wing-in-ground effect.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/192726/","Aslani, A; Shires, A; Shahsavari, A","July 2022","The concept of active circulation control has been proposed to improve lifting performance for various applications. It is mostly suggested as a flow control system to replace or minimize mechanical flaps or as a boundary layer control mechanism in the aerospace industry. The efficiency of these systems has always been the main concern due to increased drag and pumping requirements. These concerns are negligible for high-speed marine crafts as the hydrodynamic drag acting on the hull is dominant. This research investigates the aerodynamic performance of a NACA 4412 airfoil that was modified for circulation control to determine the influence of the trailing-edge geometry, blowing coefficient, angle of attack, and height above the ground to improve the efficiency of a wing-in-ground craft and shorten its take-off distance. The flow is subsonic and incompressible, and the chord Reynolds number is 1.7 × 106. A computational fluid dynamics investigation has determined that significant increases in lift can be attained through circulation control relative to the original NACA 4412 airfoil, and it is not significantly influenced by the airfoil height except when there is an extreme ground effect. Also, the lift augmentation increases approximately linearly with the blowing momentum coefficient and angle of attack. The study shows a significant improvement in the take-off length, which was reduced from 465 m to between 360 and 150 m according to the height above the ground plane, angle of attack, and the momentum coefficient when the Coanda surface is 30 mm. The circulation-controlled NACA 4412 could achieve 66% effectiveness compared to a currently available vehicle.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Canyon geomorphology has been characterised quantitatively in terms of maximum and average canyon dimensions, canyon sinuosity, average canyon thalweg gradient, and maximum canyon sidewall steepness. An assessment is made of how geomorphological characteristics vary with respect to the position of the canyon apex relative to the shelf break, continental-margin type, terrestrial source-to-sink system setting, oceanographic environment, and latitude. Scaling relationships between canyon morphometric parameters, and correlations between these and attributes of the canyon physiographic settings, terrestrial catchments, and continental shelves and slopes, have been quantified.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Comparing spatial conservation prioritization methods with site versus spatial dependency‐based connectivity.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/193940/","Muenzel, D; Critchell, K; Cox, C","September 2022","Larval dispersal is an important component of marine reserve networks. Two conceptually different approaches to incorporate dispersal connectivity into spatial planning of these networks exist, and it is an open question as to when either is most appropriate. Candidate reserve sites can be selected individually based on local properties of connectivity or on a spatial dependency-based approach of selecting clusters of strongly connected habitat patches. The first acts on individual sites, whereas the second acts on linked pairs of sites. We used a combination of larval dispersal simulations representing different seascapes and case studies of biophysical larval dispersal models in the Coral Triangle region and the province of Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, to compare the performance of these 2 methods in the spatial planning software Marxan. We explored the reserve design performance implications of different dispersal distances and patterns based on the equilibrium settlement of larvae in protected and unprotected areas. We further assessed different assumptions about metapopulation contributions from unprotected areas, including the case of 100% depletion and more moderate scenarios. The spatial dependency method was suitable when dispersal was limited, a high proportion of the area of interest was substantially degraded, or the target amount of habitat protected was low. Conversely, when subpopulations were well connected, the 100% depletion was relaxed, or more habitat was protected, protecting individual sites with high scores in metrics of connectivity was a better strategy. Spatial dependency methods generally produced more spatially clustered solutions with more benefits inside than outside reserves compared with site-based methods. Therefore, spatial dependency methods potentially provide better results for ecological persistence objectives over enhancing fisheries objectives, and vice versa. Different spatial prioritization methods of using connectivity are appropriate for different contexts, depending on dispersal characteristics, unprotected area contributions, habitat protection targets, and specific management objectives.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"“Please let me visit”: Management options for marine ecosystems in a Mediterranean Marine Protected Area.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/191723/","Tyllianakis, E","March 2022","Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as a means to support conservation of marine ecosystems is expected to depend on local communities and stakeholder’ participation and support. This paper presents the preferences of residents of Malta for measures intended to protect Posidonia oceanica seagrasses and coralligenous formations from threats from the anchoring and mooring of vessels in an offshore MPA area. The results indicate that only the most modest of restrictions increase the economic welfare of residents as participants are, overall, against further restrictions to enter the MPA. Survey participants wish to see an increase in provisioning ecosystem services such as fish caught and increases in carbon sequestration and are willing to pay to secure such benefits. Respondents also appear to have individualistic and use-driven values as a result of interacting with the MPA while past experiences play an important role in preferences, with frequent visitors strongly objecting to further restrictions to entry. The good current condition of the seagrass beds might explain the rejection of stringent restrictions but fails to account for threats from climate change and projected increase in tourism vessels’ visits. Such findings make co-operation and appropriate communication of threats and policies for management of marine resources through MPAs to the public more imperative.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"On Carbon Burial and Net Primary Production Through Earth’s History.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/182903/","Planavsky, NJ; Fakhraee, M; Bolton, EW","January 2022","The carbonate carbon isotope record has been traditionally interpreted as evidence of stability in the globally integrated ratio of organic to total carbon burial from Earth's surface environments over the past ∼3.8 billion years, but recent work has begun to question this conclusion. Herein, we use a reactive-transport modeling approach to track organic carbon oxidation at varying atmospheric oxygen levels and use that information to provide a rough estimate of net primary production through time. Our results support the emerging view that there was extensive variability in the fraction of carbon buried as organic matter (fb,org) throughout Earth's history. We strengthen the case that the carbonate carbon isotope record has been characterized by a relatively constant baseline value over time due to a fundamental mechanistic link between atmospheric O2 levels and the carbon isotope composition of net inputs to the ocean-atmosphere system. Further, using estimates of the organic carbon burial flux (Fb,org) and the burial efficiency of the carbon pump from our marine reactive-transport modeling, we also support previous work suggesting extensive fluctuation in marine net primary production over time.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Identifying where mariculture production occurs remains a major challenge for understanding its environmental impacts and the sustainability of individual farms and the sector as a whole. We compiled known mariculture locations and applied a simple production-allocation approach to map remaining global mariculture locations across 73 countries using the key determinants of distance to shore and ports, and average productivity (tonnage) of known farms. Our map represents 96% of reported fish and invertebrate mariculture production for 2017, but excludes algae which constitutes half of global mariculture production. We provide, for the first time, a publicly available spatial database of known and estimated mariculture locations. We discuss the utility and limitations of the existing data and our modeling approach, and highlight the key data gaps and future challenges for mapping aquaculture. Our results provide a vital resource for mariculture and environmental researchers, but we emphasize the need for a standardized, ground-truthed global spatial database of aquaculture locations and farm-level attributes (e.g., species, production type) to better understand the distribution of production and adequately plan for future growth.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Late Permian–Middle Triassic magnetostratigraphy in North China and its implications for terrestrial-marine correlations.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/186497/","Guo, W; Tong, J; He, Q","March 2022","A detailed magnetostratigraphic study, linked to a new latest Permian U–Pb ID-TIMS age, was undertaken on the continental Shichuanhe section (SCH) in North China in order to provide a magnetic polarity scale for the Late Permian–early Middle Triassic interval. Tilt-corrected mean directions of the characteristic remanent magnetization pass the reversal test and correspond to a site paleolatitude of 18.1°N during the Early Triassic, consistent with previous results from the North China Block. The magnetostratigraphy shows close similarity with previous studies, allowing interregional correlations with both marine and non-marine records. Normal magnetozone SCH3n, constrained by an absolute age of 252.21±0.15 Ma from an ash bed 3.5 m below its base, is unambiguously correlated to the earliest Triassic normal magnetochron LT1n. Our newly established magnetostratigraphic framework and published carbon-isotope chemostratigraphy, indicate that the Permian–Triassic Boundary is ca. 8 m above the base of SCH3n (within the middle part of the Sunjiagou Formation) at SCH. The overlying reverse polarity dominated interval (SCH3r–SCH5r) ranges to the middle Liujiagou Formation, and straddles an interval from the mid-Griesbachian to mid-Smithian. The base of the Olenekian is provisionally located in the lower part of the Liujiagou Formation, near the base of magnetozone SCH5n. The succeeding thick normal magnetozone SCH6n persists into the upper Heshanggou Formation, with the inferred Smithian–Spathian boundary located in the upper part of the Liujiagou Formation. The transition from reverse magnetozone SCH6r to the overlying normal magnetozone SCH7n, coincides with a clear erosional contact with the base of the Ermaying Formation. Consequently, magnetozone SCH7n is matched to the Early Anisian magnetochron MT3n, with the Olenekian–Anisian boundary interval missing. Our new timescale provides additional magnetostratigraphic constraints on the timing of the terrestrial ecological crisis in North China, which is found to lie within reverse magnetozone SCH2r (equivalent with reverse magnetochron LP3r), a level some 270±150 kyrs before the main marine extinction, that falls in the overlying normal magnetochron LT1n.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"An efficient procedure to predict the dynamic loads for piston liner systems in marine engines.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/171885/","Xiuyi, L; Azam, A; Yuechang, W","January 2021","The piston ring-cylinder liner (PRCL) is one of the most important parts of marine diesel engines and contributes 25% to 50% of total friction loss. The lubrication simulation analysis of the PRCL system is a challenging task. Complete understanding and precise prediction of lubrication loads is a key to understanding the friction behavior of PRCL systems as the accuracy of the friction prediction depends upon precise prediction of lubrication loads. Therefore, this paper focuses on the gas pressure calculation which is the primary source of lubrication loads. The procedure presented combines the advantages of two mainstream methods to predict loads in the PRCL system. The result is a significant reduction in the computation time without compromising on accuracy. Firstly, a comparison of both approaches is presented which suggests that each technique has its limitations (one is time-bound, and one is accuracy-bound). Then, the results from both calculation methods are verified against literature and a parametric study is performed to identify the key structural parameters of PRCL system that affect the calculation efficiency. Finally, a correlation coefficient is introduced into the analysis to combine the two approaches which then identifies the conditions under which the use of the faster method becomes invalid and replaces it with the more accurate approach. This ensures optimum performance of the calculation procedure by switching between the fast and the accurate method depending upon the accuracy requirement under given conditions, thereby, simplifying the dynamic and lubrication model of PRCL systems. The study has direct implications for the tribological design of the PRCL interface.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Identifying economic costs and knowledge gaps of invasive aquatic crustaceans.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/181373/","Kouba, A; Oficialdegui, FJ; Cuthbert, RN","December 2021","Despite voluminous literature identifying the impacts of invasive species, summaries of monetary costs for some taxonomic groups remain limited. Invasive alien crustaceans often have profound impacts on recipient ecosystems, but there may be great unknowns related to their economic costs. Using the InvaCost database, we quantify and analyse reported costs associated with invasive crustaceans globally across taxonomic, spatial, and temporal descriptors. Specifically, we quantify the costs of prominent aquatic crustaceans — crayfish, crabs, amphipods, and lobsters. Between 2000 and 2020, crayfish caused US$ 120.5 million in reported costs; the vast majority (99%) being attributed to representatives of Astacidae and Cambaridae. Crayfish-related costs were unevenly distributed across countries, with a strong bias towards European economies (US$ 116.4 million; mainly due to the signal crayfish in Sweden), followed by costs reported from North America and Asia. The costs were also largely predicted or extrapolated, and thus not based on empirical observations. Despite these limitations, the costs of invasive crayfish have increased considerably over the past two decades, averaging US$ 5.7 million per year. Invasive crabs have caused costs of US$ 150.2 million since 1960 and the ratios were again uneven (57% in North America and 42% in Europe). Damage-related costs dominated for both crayfish (80%) and crabs (99%), with management costs lacking or even more under-reported. Reported costs for invasive amphipods (US$ 178.8 thousand) and lobsters (US$ 44.6 thousand) were considerably lower, suggesting a lack of effort in reporting costs for these groups or effects that are largely non-monetised. Despite the well-known damage caused by invasive crustaceans, we identify data limitations that prevent a full accounting of the economic costs of these invasive groups, while highlighting the increasing costs at several scales based on the available literature. Further cost reports are needed to better assess the true magnitude of monetary costs caused by invasive aquatic crustaceans.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Extensive marine anoxia in the European epicontinental sea during the end-Triassic mass extinction.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/183557/","He, T; Wignall, PB; Newton, RJ","February 2022","Warming-induced marine anoxia has been hypothesized as an environmental stressor for the end-Triassic mass extinction (ETME), but links between the spread of marine anoxia and the two phases of extinction are poorly constrained. Here, we report iron speciation and trace metal data from the Bristol Channel Basin and Larne Basin of the NW European epicontinental sea (EES), spanning the Triassic–Jurassic (T–J) transition (~ 202–200 Ma). Results show frequent development of anoxic-ferruginous conditions, interspersed with ephemeral euxinic episodes in the Bristol Channel Basin during the latest Rhaetian, whereas the contemporaneous Larne Basin remained largely oxygenated, suggesting heterogeneous redox conditions between basins. Subsequently, more persistent euxinic conditions prevailed across the T–J boundary in both basins, coinciding precisely with the second phase of the ETME. We propose that this later phase of benthic faunal loss in the NW EES was directly driven by the bottom-water oxygen crisis. Conversely, although anoxic conditions persisted into the early Hettangian, the benthos diversified at this time in nearshore areas. Post-extinction conditions were poised at a fluctuating redox state, but anoxia did not extend into the shallowest areas where benthic marine ecosystem recovery was occurring.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Unifying approaches to Functional Marine Connectivity for improved marine resource management: the European SEA-UNICORN COST Action.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/189537/","Darnaude, A; Arnaud-Haond, S; Hunter, E","February 2022","Truly sustainable development in a human-altered, fragmented marine environment subject to unprecedented climate change, demands informed planning strategies in order to be successful. Beyond a simple understanding of the distribution of marine species, data describing how variations in spatio-temporal dynamics impact ecosystem functioning and the evolution of species are required. Marine Functional Connectivity (MFC) characterizes the flows of matter, genes and energy produced by organism movements and migrations across the seascape. As such, MFC determines the ecological and evolutionary interdependency of populations, and ultimately the fate of species and ecosystems. Gathering effective MFC knowledge can therefore improve predictions of the impacts of environmental change and help to refine management and conservation strategies for the seas and oceans. Gathering these data are challenging however, as access to, and survey of marine ecosystems still presents significant challenge. Over 50 European institutions currently investigate aspects of MFC using complementary methods across multiple research fields, to understand the ecology and evolution of marine species. The aim of SEA-UNICORN, a COST Action within the European Union Horizon 2020 framework programme, is to bring together this research effort, unite the multiple approaches to MFC, and to integrate these under a common conceptual and analytical framework. The consortium brings together a diverse group of scientists to collate existing MFC data, to identify knowledge gaps, to enhance complementarity among disciplines, and to devise common approaches to MFC. SEA-UNICORN will promote co-working between connectivity practitioners and ecosystem modelers to facilitate the incorporation of MFC data into the predictive models used to identify marine conservation priorities. Ultimately, SEA-UNICORN will forge strong forward-working links between scientists, policy-makers and stakeholders to facilitate the integration of MFC knowledge into decision support tools for marine management and environmental policies.","Marine","University of Leeds"

However, little is known about how a volcanic eruption in the past could cause environmental changes in the sea and its impact on organic matter (OM) accumulation due to the difficulties in gaining high-resolution sedimentary records. Here we conducted a high-resolution petrographic study and geochemical analyses including proxies reflecting the influx of volcanic and terrestrial material (Hg, Al, Fe, CIA), redox conditions (Mo, FeHR/FeT, FePy/FeHR), paleoproductivity (Baxs, Cuxs, Sixs), and biological variations (δ13Corg, δ15Norg) on a 25-cm long drilling core bracketing three cycles of volcanic activities from the Upper Ordovician Wufeng Formation in South China. This enables us to find, for the first time, the detailed process of environmental changes and different stages of OM accumulation induced by volcanism. Three nearly identical cycles have been identified, and each of them is comprised of a bentonite bed, a siliceous clay-rich mudstone interval, a radiolarian bed, and a siliceous mudstone interval with intercalations of thin pyrite. The marine redox condition shows the strongest anoxia and even euxinia on the eruption stage and began to decrease with the waning of the volcanic activities shown by Hg/TOC. The volcanic eruption will cause the microbial change that is likely reflecting the shift from nitrogen-fixation bacteria bloom to radiolarian bloom through the variation of bioavailable nitrate and some trace metals such as Cu. Of significance is that the volcanism-induced shift in microbial communities from prokaryotes to eukaryotes bloom is observed to impact the abundance of the sedimentary OM, a critical process leading to the wide occurrence of abundant oil and gas reservoirs in south China.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"The isotopic composition of sedimentary organic zinc and implications for the global Zn isotope mass balance.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/187484/","Zhang, Y; Planavsky, NJ; Zhao, M","September 2021","Zinc (Zn) is a bioessential element whose cycling in the marine environment is closely linked to the biological pump. As a vital micronutrient, Zn is depleted in marine surface waters and enriched in deep waters. This has given rise to the longstanding hope that Zn could serve as a robust paleoproductivity proxy. There has been a recent focus on how Zn isotope signatures can be used to track the evolution of the biological pump. However, the factors controlling variations in the sedimentary Zn isotope composition of core-top sediments are debated and these values are influenced by changes in the relative contributions of biological uptake and scavenging processes and by mineral fractionations. In order to provide a new perspective on the Zn isotopic signature of marine core-top sediments and their potential for tracing ocean biogeochemical processes, we developed a sample preparation procedure to extract organically bound Zn (excluding inorganic Zn) without a significant isotope fractionation. We tested five potential organic solvents and found that the isopropanol extraction procedure provided a reproducible and robust result that yielded the highest recovery rate of organically bound Zn without a significant associated isotopic fractionation and appeared to exclude common mineral bound forms of Zn. This extraction procedure was used to analyze the Zn concentrations and isotopic compositions (δ66Zn) of core-top sediment samples from Long Island Sound and the Peruvian continental margin. Our results suggest that the δ66Zn value of organic Zn increases with water depth, thus providing additional support for the finding that burial of isotopically light Zn occurs predominantly in shallow high-productivity sediments. However, we also found that the δ66Zn values of the estimated authigenic Zn component are consistently lighter than those of the organic Zn fraction, consistent with diagenetic (sediment pile) scavenging of organic derived Zn in sulfides imparting an isotope fractionation.","Marine","University of Leeds"

This study combines contingent valuation and latent traits questions to derive the willingness of Indonesian respondents to support MPP mitigation initiatives. One and two-step models are compared to test the sensitivity of results to modelling assumptions. Latent traits help to understand the willingness to pay (WTP) for MPP and one and two-step approaches produce comparable results. On average respondents are willing to pay £15, per person, per year to reduce MPP, or 2% of the average monthly salary.

"Bioactive Trace Metals and Their Isotopes as Paleoproductivity Proxies: An Assessment Using GEOTRACES‐Era Data.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/195874/","Horner, TJ; Little, SH; Conway, TM","May 2021","Phytoplankton productivity and export sequester climatically significant quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide as particulate organic carbon through a suite of processes termed the biological pump. Constraining how the biological pump operated in the past is important for understanding past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and Earth's climate history. However, reconstructing the history of the biological pump requires proxies. Due to their intimate association with biological processes, several bioactive trace metals and their isotopes are potential proxies for past phytoplankton productivity, including iron, zinc, copper, cadmium, molybdenum, barium, nickel, chromium, and silver. Here, we review the oceanic distributions, driving processes, and depositional archives for these nine metals and their isotopes based on GEOTRACES-era datasets. We offer an assessment of the overall maturity of each isotope system to serve as a proxy for diagnosing aspects of past ocean productivity and identify priorities for future research. This assessment reveals that cadmium, barium, nickel, and chromium isotopes offer the most promise as tracers of paleoproductivity, whereas iron, zinc, copper, and molybdenum do not. Too little is known about silver to make a confident determination. Intriguingly, the trace metals that are least sensitive to productivity may be used to track other aspects of ocean chemistry, such as nutrient sources, particle scavenging, organic complexation, and ocean redox state. These complementary sensitivities suggest new opportunities for combining perspectives from multiple proxies that will ultimately enable painting a more complete picture of marine paleoproductivity, biogeochemical cycles, and Earth's climate history.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Codium fragile ssp. fragile is one of the most invasive species in the world. The species has deleterious impacts on marine ecosystems, but can also coexist with other Codium congeners, with neutral impact. Several invasive macroalgae have been described to occur along the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula, including C. fragile. However, despite its presence being noted in citizen science surveys, the occurrence of C. fragile on the coast of Portugal was not confirmed (except in the Azores Islands). The cryptic nature of this invasive macroalga has led to several misidentifications, and strict taxonomic approaches must therefore be used to confirm sightings. Previous intensive field sampling (2017–2018) aimed at recording the presence of different macroalgae did not find C. fragile along the Portuguese coast, northwards from Praia do Matadouro. Here, we report the first confirmed record of C. fragile on the coast of Portugal, in the Avencas Marine Park. Identification of the alga was confirmed by microscopic examination of the utricles. Early detection of invasive species is essential, and further research should be carried out in the surrounding areas in order to better understand the invasion pathways to enable correct application of management plans.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Estimating benthic trophic levels to assess the effectiveness of marine protected area management.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/174685/","Blanco, A; Beger, M; Planes, S","May 2021","Designating and managing marine protected areas (MPAs) can mitigate many ocean threats. Banning fishing activities within MPAs enhances the robustness of food-web dynamics and thus increases trophic resilience. Ecosystem function indicators, such as mean trophic level, are increasingly applied in conservation management. Stable isotope analysis is a common tool in trophodynamic studies as it provides information about food sources and trophic level within food webs. In contrast to the traditional top-down approaches in conservation management (mainly for fisheries), this study focuses on bottom-up responses to protection according to the target species in regional small-scale fisheries. The present study aimed to examine how MPA status affects trophodynamics in the rocky reefs of the Illas Atlánticas Marine-Terrestrial National Park (Galicia, NW Spain). Results showed no differences between inside and outside the MPA in species stable isotopic signatures or trophic level. However, these results should be considered with caution due to some limitations in the study design (small number of sites per location, biogeographic differences associated with the island nature of the MPA, or seasonal variability). Nevertheless, the lax fishing management, the lack of proper implementation (the MPA was established in 2002 without a management plan until 2019), and the small size of the studied MPA may result in ineffective conservation outcomes that could have been reflected in the stable isotopic content of the food web. The large number of “paper park” MPAs existing worldwide are not only detrimental to the perception of marine protection, but also provide poor protection of marine ecosystems. Subject to further studies accounting for both environmental and management factors on stable isotope signatures, trophic interactions can form a cost-effective tool for monitoring MPA effectiveness.","Marine","University of Leeds"

We tagged adult and juvenile gannets at the world's largest colony (Bass Rock) and reviewed two sources of survey data for different age classes to study their movements through southern North Sea waters. Tracked birds showed peak numbers in the southern North Sea in mid-October, with much smaller numbers there during November. Adults were distributed throughout the area, including waters close to OWFs, whereas juveniles were confined to the coast. Survey data indicated high proportions of immature gannets in southern North Sea waters, suggesting higher collision risk than for adults. Gannets present in November may be predominantly from colonies further north than Bass Rock.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Here we demonstrate the feasibility of sampling from commercial vessels (Mediterranean ferries) while underway, as a strategy to facilitate replicable, systematic marine eDNA surveys in locations that would normally be challenging and expensive for researchers to access. Sixteen eDNA samples were collected from four fixed sampling stations, and in response to four cetacean sightings, across three cruises undertaken along the 300 km ferry route between Livorno (Tuscany) and Golfo Aranci (Sardinia) in the Ligurian/Tyrrhenian Seas, June-July 2018. Using 12SrDNA and 16SrDNA metabarcoding markers, we recovered diverse marine vertebrate Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) from teleost fish, elasmobranchs, and cetaceans. We detected sample heterogeneity consistent with previously known variation in species occurrences, including putative species spawning peaks associated with specific sea surface temperature ranges, and increased night time abundance of bathypelagic species known to undertake diel migrations through the water column. We suggest commercial vessel based marine eDNA sampling using the global shipping network has potential to facilitate broad-scale biodiversity monitoring in the world’s oceans.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Controls on the cadmium isotope composition of modern marine sediments.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197429/","Bryan, AL; Dickson, AJ; Dowdall, F","April 2021","Continental margin sediments have been identified as the dominant sink in the marine budget of cadmium (Cd). The isotopic composition of this important output flux is, however, unknown. Here we present, with measurements on the Argentine continental margin, the first observational constraints on the isotopic composition of Cd in modern marine oxic and sub-oxic sediments. We identify two main removal mechanisms of Cd; in organic material, and by sulfide formation. Surface margin sediments (0–0.5 cm), with dissolved O2 below detection from ∼0.5 cm, are isotopically lighter than overlying oxygenated waters. A mass balance for these surface sediments indicates that Cd is present dominantly as organically-bound particulate Cd. In sub-surface sediments, Cd concentrations increase in the zone of nitrate reduction, and attain similar isotopic compositions as the water that overlies the sediment (i.e. ∼0.35‰ in deep waters). These observations are consistent with a downward diffusive flux of seawater Cd and redox-driven quantitative removal of that Cd during sulfide precipitation. In combination, these two routes of Cd removal lead to burial of isotopically light organic Cd in margin sub-oxic sediments that enables the global isotopic Cd budget to be balanced.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Thus, effective means of assessing and predicting the consequences of IAS predation on native prey population stability remains a vital goal for conservation. Here, we applied two classic ecological concepts, consumer functional response (FR) and prey switching, to predict and understand the ecological impacts of juveniles of the lionfish (Pterois volitans), a notorious and widespread marine invader. Functional responses and prey switching propensities were quantified towards three representative prey species: Artemia salina, Palaemonetes varians, and Gammarus oceanicus. Lionfish exhibited potentially destabilising Type II FRs towards individual prey species, owing to high consumption rates at low prey densities, whilst FR magnitudes differed among prey species. Functional response attack rates (a) were highest, and handling times (h) lowest, towards A. salina, followed by P. varians and then G. oceanicus. Maximum feeding rates (1/h) and functional response ratios (FRR; a/h) also followed this impact gradient for the three prey species. Lionfish, however, displayed a potentially population stabilising prey switching propensity (i.e. frequency-dependent predation) when multiple prey species were presented simultaneously, where disproportionately less of rare prey, and more of abundant prey, were consumed. Whilst FR and FRR magnitudes indicate marked per capita lionfish predatory impacts towards prey species, a strong prey switching propensity may reduce in-field impacts by offering low density prey refuge in biodiverse communities. Our results thus corroborate field patterns documenting variable impacts of lionfish, with prey extirpations less likely in diverse communities owing to frequency-dependent predation.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"The benefits of heterogeneity in spatial prioritisation within coral reef environments.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/174376/","Nolan, MKB; Kim, CJS; Hoegh-Guldberg, O","April 2021","Coral reefs are highly vulnerable habitats, threatened by climate change and local anthropogenic impacts. Management is imperative, and spatial prioritisation apportions the area of interest to inform investments of scarce conservation resources. Spatially delineated planning units used to make management decisions are typically large enough to contain significant natural variabilities, but the ecological significance of such variance is seldom considered in planning decisions. On coral reefs, the patchiness of habitat quality within planning units matters both ecologically and functionally. Here, we show that considering within-planning unit variance in spatial prioritisation influences the location and design of reserve networks. Studying Timor-Leste, we statistically model the average and variance in coral cover. We compare conservation priority areas for scenarios informed by coral cover and variance to a baseline scenario with the spatial prioritisation software Marxan. To further explain these differences, and to show the value of including coral variance as a metric in spatial prioritisation, we created a reserve quality score. We show that the similarity between reserve networks was only 57% for protection, and 44% for restoration objectives. For both objectives, the inclusion of cover variance improves the conservation benefit of management. This project has shown a novel way to target areas for restoration. These results demonstrate that not only is mean coral cover (and, by extension, reef condition) a key criterion in selecting marine conservation actions, but its variance must be considered in spatial conservation prioritisation to improve both the efficiency and benefit of management actions within marine reserve networks.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Distinct interspecific and intraspecific vulnerability of coastal species to global change.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/174156/","Nielsen, ES; Henriques, R; Beger, M","April 2021","Characterising and predicting species responses to anthropogenic global change is one of the key challenges in contemporary ecology and conservation. The sensitivity of marine species to climate change is increasingly being described with forecasted species distributions, yet these rarely account for population level processes such as genomic variation and local adaptation. This study compares inter- and intra-specific patterns of biological composition to determine how vulnerability to climate change, and its environmental drivers, vary across species and populations. We compare species trajectories for three ecologically important southern African marine invertebrates at two time points in the future, both at the species level, with correlative species distribution models, and at the population level, with gradient forest models. Reported range shifts are species-specific and include both predicted range gains and losses. Forecasted species responses to climate change are strongly influenced by changes in a suite of environmental variables, from sea surface salinity and sea surface temperature, to minimum air temperature. Our results further suggest a mismatch between future habitat suitability (where species can remain in their ecological niche) and genomic vulnerability (where populations retain their genomic composition), highlighting the inter- and intraspecific variability in species' sensitivity to global change. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of considering species and population level climatic vulnerability when proactively managing coastal marine ecosystems in the Anthropocene.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Experimental evaluation of the extractability of Fe-bound organic carbon in sediments as a function of carboxyl content.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/164864/","Fisher, BJ; Moore, OW; Faust, JC","August 2020","The majority of organic carbon (OC) burial in marine sediments occurs on continental shelves, of which an estimated 10–20% is associated with reactive iron (FeR). The association of OC with FeR (OC-FeR) is thought to facilitate preservation of organic matter (OM) in sediments and therefore represents an important carbon sink. The citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite (CBD) method is used to quantify OC-FeR in marine sediments by reductively dissolving FeR, thereby releasing bound OC. While the CBD method is widely used, it may be less efficient at measuring OC-FeR than currently thought, due to the incomplete reduction of FeR, resulting from the neutral pH conditions required to prevent OM hydrolysis. Additionally, the typical range of values reported for OC-FeR in marine sediments is narrow, despite variation in OM and FeR inputs, OM source types and chemical compositions. This suggests a limitation exists on the amount of OC that can become associated with FeR, and/or that the CBD method is limited in the OC-FeR that it is able to quantify. In assessing the efficiency of the CBD method, we aimed to understand whether methodological errors or (mis)interpretation of these extraction results may contribute to the apparent limitation on OC-FeR values. Here, we synthesised OC-FeR composites with a known FeR phase and known OM moieties, varying in carboxyl content, at neutral pH. These were spiked into OC-free marine sediment, and subject to a CBD extraction to investigate i) the efficiency of CBD for OC extraction; ii) the efficiency of CBD for FeR extraction; ii) how the OC moiety affects the physical parameters of associated FeR minerals; and iii) the impact of OM moiety on OC and Fe release. We show that the CBD method results in only partial dissolution of the most susceptible FeR phase (ferrihydrite) and therefore incomplete removal of bound OC. While as little as ~20% of Fe is released from OC-free ferrihydrite, structural disorder of the mineral phase increases with the inclusion of more OC, resulting in greater losses of up to 62% Fe for carboxyl rich OC-FeR complexes. In addition, our results show that the NaCl control step performed in the CBD method is capable of removing weakly bound OC from FeR, such that inclusion of this OC in the total OC-FeR fraction may increase marine sediments OC-FeR estimates by ~33%. Finally, we suggest that the structure of OC involved in OC-FeR binding can affect quantification of the OC-FeR pool. Our results have important implications for assessing the FeR bound OC fraction in marine sediments and the fate of this OC in the global carbon cycle.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Thus there is an increasing demand on tightening the emission standards for marine diesel engines, which necessitates the research on various emission reduction strategies. This review covers emission regulations and emission factors (EFs), environmental effects and available emission reduction solutions for marine diesel engines. Not only the establishment of the emission control areas (ECAs) in the regulations but also many experiments show high concerns about the sulfur limits in fuels, sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Research results reveal that NOx emissions from marine diesel engines account for 50% of total NOx in harbors and coastal regions. Sulfur content in fuel oil is an important parameter index that determines the development direction of emission control technologies. Despites some issues, biodiesel, methanol and liquefied nature gas (LNG) play their important roles in reducing emissions as well as in replacing fossil energy, being promising fuels for marine diesel engines. Fuel-water emulsion (FWE) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) are effective treatment option for NOx emissions control. Common rail fuel injection is an effective fuel injection strategy to achieve simultaneous reductions in particulate matter (PM) and NOx. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and wet scrubbing are the most mature and effective exhaust aftertreatment methods for marine diesel engines, which show 90% De-NOx efficiency and 95% De-SOx efficiency. It can be concluded that the integrated multi-pollutant treatment for ship emissions holds great promise.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Does Arctic warming reduce preservation of organic matter in Barents Sea sediments?","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/162662/","Faust, JC; Stevenson, MA; Abbott, GD","June 2020","Over the last few decades, the Barents Sea experienced substantial warming, an expansion of relatively warm Atlantic water and a reduction in sea ice cover. This environmental change forces the entire Barents Sea ecosystem to adapt and restructure and therefore changes in pelagic–benthic coupling, organic matter sedimentation and long-term carbon sequestration are expected. Here we combine new and existing organic and inorganic geochemical surface sediment data from the western Barents Sea and show a clear link between the modern ecosystem structure, sea ice cover and the organic carbon and CaCO3 contents in Barents Sea surface sediments. Furthermore, we discuss the sources of total and reactive iron phases and evaluate the spatial distribution of organic carbon bound to reactive iron. Consistent with a recent global estimate we find that on average 21.0 ± 8.3 per cent of the total organic carbon is associated to reactive iron (fOC-FeR) in Barents Sea surface sediments. The spatial distribution of fOC-FeR, however, seems to be unrelated to sea ice cover, Atlantic water inflow or proximity to land. Future Arctic warming might, therefore, neither increase nor decrease the burial rates of iron-associated organic carbon. However, our results also imply that ongoing sea ice reduction and the associated alteration of vertical carbon fluxes might cause accompanied shifts in the Barents Sea surface sedimentary organic carbon content, which might result in overall reduced carbon sequestration in the future.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Uranium isotope (U) records from carbonates have recently been used to argue for significant swings in the global marine redox state from the late Neoproterozoic to the early Cambrian. However, geochemical signatures in carbonates—the U isotope archive most commonly employed to argue for redox shifts—are susceptible to diagenetic alteration and may have variable offsets from seawater values. Therefore, there is an impetus to reconstruct seawater U isotopic evolution using another sedimentary archive, in order to verify that these excursions can indeed be linked to global shifts in marine redox landscape. Here we report new U isotope data from two fine-grained siliciclastic upper Ediacaran to lower Cambrian (ca. 551–515 Ma) successions in South China. We find large δ²³⁸U swings between -0.63‰ and +0.39‰ for calculated values of authigenic U in the siliciclastic rocks, consistent with correlative records from the carbonates. The replication of these patterns in both carbonate and siliciclastic units provides confirmatory evidence that the early Cambrian seawater was characterized by highly variable U isotope compositions. These new δ²³⁸U data also provide higher-resolution records of global oceanic redox conditions during Cambrian Age 3, coeval with a critical interval of the Cambrian explosion. These δ²³⁸U data bolster the case that the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition experienced massive swings in marine redox state, providing a dynamic environmental backdrop for and potentially even a key driver of the emergence and radiation of metazoans.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Our hypothesis was that a shear-induced instability will enable OLs to exhibit favourable lubrication performance. During storage, OLs exhibited resistance to droplet aggregation for up to 6 weeks owing to the proteins (3.5–152.8 kDa molecular weights) stabilizing the OL droplets. However, presence of divalent (Ca2+) ions induced destabilization with marked increase in droplet size (p < 0.05). OLs demonstrated shear thinning behaviour, displaying an order of magnitude higher viscosity than flaxseed oil (FSO) at low shear rates (<10 s−1). Strikingly, OLs mirrored the frictional profile of FSO regardless of entrainment speeds, due to droplet coalescence, validating the hypothesis. Such kinetic stability with shear-induced coalescing feature of OLs hold strong potential for future plant-based food development, particularly in achieving desired mouthfeel characteristics.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Off-farm employment and multidimensional poverty: empirical evidences from the Yellow River Basin in China.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/201791/","Wu, X.; Zhang, Q.; Ma, H.","March 2023","As an essential way to enhance farmers’ self-development ability, off-farm employment plays an indispensable role in farmers’ multidimensional poverty reduction in many countries. Employing a survey of 1926 farmers in five provinces of the Yellow River Basin in China, this paper examined the multi-dimensional poverty reduction effect of off-farm employment and the heterogeneous influence of different dimensions of off-farm employment (modes, levels, distances and frequency). The results showed that (1) although absolute poverty in the income dimension was largely eliminated in the Yellow River Basin, the poverty in social resources, transportation facilities, employment security were the key bottlenecks restricting farmers’ self-development. (2) The province with the best multidimensional poverty reduction effect for non-farm employment was Shaanxi, with the largest contribution to employment security. (3) Improving off-farm employment level, distance and time can significantly alleviate the multi-dimensional poverty of farmers. Therefore, to lessen the multi-dimensional poverty of farmers in the Yellow River Basin, it is necessary to focus on the governance of multi-dimensional key poverty-stricken areas, such as the middle and upper courses of the Yellow River, adopting multidimensional poverty alleviation strategy of off-farm employment according to local conditions, working on the farmers’ deficiencies in social resources, mobility, employment security, and deepening the effect of off-farm employment on benefiting farmers and helping the poor.","Ai","University of Leeds"

"Laminar burning velocities and Markstein numbers for pure hydrogen and methane/hydrogen/air mixtures at elevated pressures.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202439/","AL-Khafaji, M.; Yang, J.; Tomlin, A.S.","June 2023","Spherically expanding flame propagations have been employed to measure flame speeds for H2/CH4/air mixtures over a wide range of H2 fractions (30 %, 50 %, 70 and 100 % hydrogen by volume), at initial temperatures of 303 K and 360 K, and pressures of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 MPa. The equivalence ratio (ϕ) was varied from 0.5 to 2.5 for pure hydrogen and from 0.8 to 1.2 for methane/hydrogen mixtures. Experimental laminar burning velocities and Markstein numbers for methane/hydrogen/air mixtures at high pressures, which are crucial for gas turbine applications, are very rare in the literature. Moreover, simulations using three recent chemical kinetic mechanisms (Konnov-2018 detailed reaction, Aramco-2.0-2016 and San Diego Methane detailed mechanism (version 20161214)) were compared against the experimentally derived laminar burning velocities. The maximum laminar burning velocity for 30 % and 50 % H2 occurs at ϕ = 1.1. However, it shifts to ϕ = 1.2 for 70 % H2 and to ϕ = 1.7 for a pure H2 flame. The laminar burning velocities increased with hydrogen fraction and temperature, and decreased with pressure. Unexpected behaviour was recorded for pure H2 flames at low temperature and ϕ = 1.5, 1.7 wherein ul did not decrease when the pressure increased from 0.1 to 0.5 MPa. Although, the measurement uncertainty is large at these conditions, the flame structure analysis showed a minimum decline in the mass fractions of the active species (H, O, and OH) with the rise in the initial pressure. Markstein length (Lb) and Markstein number (Mab and Masr) varied non-monotonically with hydrogen volume fraction, pressure and temperature. There was generally good agreement between simulations and experimentally derived laminar burning velocities, however, for experiments of rich-pure hydrogen at high initial pressures, the level of agreement decreased but remained within the limits of experimental uncertainty.","Ai","University of Leeds"

Using RNA-sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR we demonstrate that inflammation upregulates the expression of the transmembrane protein TMEM100 in silent nociceptors and electrophysiology revealed that over-expression of TMEM100 is required and sufficient to un-silence silent nociceptors in mice. Moreover, we show that mice lacking TMEM100 do not develop secondary mechanical hypersensitivity—i.e., pain hypersensitivity that spreads beyond the site of inflammation—during knee joint inflammation and that AAV-mediated overexpression of TMEM100 in articular afferents in the absence of inflammation is sufficient to induce mechanical hypersensitivity in remote skin regions without causing knee joint pain. Thus, our work identifies TMEM100 as a key regulator of silent nociceptor un-silencing and reveals a physiological role for this hitherto enigmatic afferent subclass in triggering spatially remote secondary mechanical hypersensitivity during inflammation.","Ai","University of Leeds"

The tripartite multidrug efflux pump system from Escherichia coli, AcrAB-TolC, is a target for inhibition to lessen resistance development and restore antibiotic efficacy, with homologs in other ESKAPE pathogens. Here, we rationalize a mechanism of inhibition against the periplasmic adaptor protein, AcrA, using a combination of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, cellular efflux assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. We define the structural dynamics of AcrA and find that an inhibitor can inflict long-range stabilisation across all four of its domains, whereas an interacting efflux substrate has minimal effect. Our results support a model where an inhibitor forms a molecular wedge within a cleft between the lipoyl and αβ barrel domains of AcrA, diminishing its conformational transmission of drug-evoked signals from AcrB to TolC. This work provides molecular insights into multidrug adaptor protein function which could be valuable for developing antimicrobial therapeutics.","Ai","University of Leeds"

Raw radiocarbon ages measured in samples must be converted to calendar ages using an appropriate calibration curve. Tree-ring datasets provide the gold-standard for developing a precise curve of atmospheric radiocarbon levels over long-time scales. Here, we reconstruct atmospheric radiocarbon levels using a millennium-long section of tree-ring chronology segments that extend into the last glacial period. The samples were obtained from subfossil larch trees recovered from clay quarries at Revine, Italy. Our reconstruction shows higher variations in the amplitude of atmospheric radiocarbon between 18,475 and 17,350 calendar years before the present than that detected in the IntCal20 calibration curve. Comparing the new tree-ring based reconstruction with Beryllium-10 fluxes derived from ice cores, we hypothesise that these variations are driven by solar variability. Our results demonstrate the unique value of sub-decadal radiocarbon sequences derived from glacial tree-ring chronologies.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Phytoremediation as a Tool to Remove Drivers of Antimicrobial Resistance in the Aquatic Environment.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202352/","Chowdhury, K.F.; Hall, R.J.; McNally, A.","June 2023","Antimicrobials, heavy metals, and biocides are ubiquitous contaminants frequently detected in water bodies across the globe. These chemicals are known as drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), as these chemicals can select for resistance. Tools and processes, are therefore, needed to remove these chemicals from the environment to tackle the environmental component of AMR. Aquatic phytoremediation is a nature-inspired green solution to remove contaminants from the environment. Phytoremediation utilises macrophytes’ ability to sequester and degrade chemical pollutants in aquatic environments. In this review, we define the problem statement by highlighting the presence of AMR drivers in the aquatic environment. We also provide an in-depth review of phytoremediation to tackle chemical pollution by evaluating mechanisms for the removal and degradation of chemicals. This review identifies potential hyper-accumulators and understands how plant species and chemical composition can influence the potential for accumulation. Different pollutants accumulate to different extents in a range of aquatic macrophytes. Therefore, the combined use of floating, submerged and emergent plants would facilitate the optimum removal of AMR drivers considered in this review. A suggested configuration includes Helianthus annus around the edge of a contaminated site, followed by a belt of submerged plants (Myriophyllum aquaticum) and a bed of floating plants (e.g., Lemna species) together with the hyperaccumulator, Phragmites australis. Whilst phytoremediation offers a promising option to treat contaminated water, several critical knowledge gaps still exist. The effect of co-exposure to contaminants on the accumulation potential of plants and the fate of antibiotic-resistant genes and bacteria during the phytoremediation process are highlighted in this review. Based on this understanding, targeted areas for future research are proposed.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Lubricating Performance of Polymer-Coated Liposomes.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198319/","Hiorth, M; Mihailovic, L; Adamczak, M","April 2023","Dry mouth is a troublesome condition linked to lubrication failure and leads to other diseases such as fungal infections and wounds in the oral cavity. There are many commercial salivary substitutes in the market, but none with a long-lasting lubrication effect. Polymer-coated liposomes can be an interesting formulation strategy for retrieving the symptoms of dry mouth by mimicking the micelles of saliva. In the present study, polymer coated-liposomes were prepared by the conventional thin film method and subsequently coated with three different polymers with different charge densities; alginate, chitosan and hydrophobically modified ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose (HM-EHEC). The prepared polymer-coated liposomes were studied concerning their lubricating properties using a ball-on-disc tribometer at 2 N load at 37 °C, and their flow behaviours were also measured. Solutions of the pure polymers and dispersions of the uncoated liposomes were also studied to investigate any contributions from the individual components. A commercial dry mouth product based on HEC (hydroxyethyl cellulose) and glycerol was also included. The formulations were measured as soon as possible after preparation and some of them after >4 weeks. Results demonstrated that all the positively-charged formulations (chitosan, positive liposomes and chitosan-coated liposomes) had superior lubricating properties with friction coefficients (μ < 0.1) at orally relevant speeds (50 mm/s) as compared to the neutral or negatively-charged systems. At boundary lubrication conditions (3 mm/s), the chitosan-coated liposomes obtained an even lower friction force than the individual components, thus indicating a synergistic effect between the polymer and the liposome.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Improving properties of Litsea cubeba oil Pickering emulsion-loaded gelatin-based bio-nanocomposite film via optimizing blending ratio: Application for mango preservation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202750/","Yang, Z.; Li, M.; Li, Y.","June 2023","To improve the biological and water-barrier properties of gelatin film, we incorporated the red roselle extract (RRE), ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO), and Litsea cubeba oil Pickering emulsion (LCON) into the GE film. The effect of RRE, ZnO, and LOCN on the properties of GE film was assessed using Box–Behnken response surface design (BBD). The BBD results revealed that these compounds greatly affect the properties of the film, especially the contribution of ZnO/LCON on the mechanical and water barrier properties of the film. The optimal antifungal (80.15%), antibacterial (31.24 mm), antioxidant (73.00%), tensile strength (42.03 MPa), elongation at break (25.50%), water vapor permeability (18.01 g mm·m−2·Kpa−1·h−1), and water contact angle (110.2°) of the film were obtained at 1.10% RRE, 1.51% ZnO and 2.38% LCON. The X-ray diffraction pattern and FTIR spectra results indicated the change of molecular interactions and semi-crystalline structure in the film. The scanning electron microscopy, fluorescence image, and energy dispersive X-ray results revealed that the excellent dispersion of RRE, ZnO, and LCON in the GE matrix led to an even and smooth structure in the film. This structure offers a positive effect on improving the mechanical and barrier properties of the film. The colorful patterns were successfully printed on the film to provide essential product information. Due to its excellent biological, mechanical, and barrier properties, the optimized film was applied for mango preservation. The optimized GE/RRE/ZnO/LCON film significantly controlled the postharvest quality and anthracnose in mango. Thus, the GE/RRE/ZnO/LCON film has great potential for mango preservation in active packaging applications.","Ai","University of Leeds"

Against this background, this empirical study investigates the cognitive processing of live captioning in interpreting on Zoom Meetings. 13 interpreting trainees in a postgraduate professional training programme were recruited for an eye-tracking experiment of simultaneous interpreting under two conditions: with live captioning on and with live captioning off. Their eye movement data and interpreting performance data were collected during the experiment. Three questions were explored: 1) How do the interpreters process the additional layer of visual information from live captioning? 2) Which types of information segments tax more cognitive resources in interpreting with live captioning? 3) Is there a significant difference in interpreting accuracy between interpreting with live captioning and interpreting without live captioning? The results showed the following findings: 1) Although participants were observed to constantly shift their attention between the live transcript area and the non-live transcript area, they tended to consciously keep their visual attention to the live captioning area when numbers and proper names appeared. 2) With live captioning on, it required more cognitive effort to process the information containing a higher density of numbers and proper names than processing information without numbers and proper names. 3) There was a significant improvement in the number and proper name accuracy in interpreting with live captioning.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Experimental and theoretical studies of the mechanism of oxidation of arsenopyrite in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/201881/","Jiang, K.; Santos-Carballal, D.; Liu, J.","May 2023","Arsenopyrite, which is a typical gold-bearing mineral, is widely distributed in gold tailings. In this study, we have examined the surface morphology of arsenopyrite before and after oxidation, the types of oxidation products, and the oxidation mechanism. We have carried out froth flotation and contact angle measurements and found that the wettability, which is a descriptor of the hydrophilicity of the arsenopyrite surfaces, increases with the levels of surface oxidation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the elemental composition before and after oxidation, which has demonstrated that both Fe(II) and As(III) oxidize to Fe(III) and As(V), respectively. The microscopic changes of the surface at the atomic level were also examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), which indicated that the oxidation products gradually and partially cover the surface of the arsenopyrite upon reaction with hydrogen peroxide. These observations explain why the arsenopyrite XPS signal and the uniform change in wettability do not vanish completely during oxidation. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to describe the oxidation of the surface As atoms by the O of the chemisorbed hydrogen peroxide molecules. The computational results also show that the hydrogen peroxide dissociates into two hydroxyl groups that coordinate the Fe and As atoms on the surface of the arsenopyrite. The results of this study have important implications for the reuse of gold tailings containing arsenopyrite.","Ai","University of Leeds"

"Integrating socio-spatial preference heterogeneity into the assessment of the aesthetic quality of a Mediterranean agricultural landscape.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202096/","Albaladejo-García, J.A.; Zabala, J.A.; Alcon, F.","July 2023","Assessing ecosystem services associated with agricultural landscapes is of growing interest to the research and policy/practice communities. One particularly challenging aspect to understand is the value of the aesthetic quality of such landscapes, even though this is one of the main contributions that agricultural landscapes make to cultural ecosystem service provision. Indeed, as increasing demands are placed on agricultural landscapes for food production, infrastructure development and urbanisation, aesthetic qualities can be severely affected, particularly if those landscapes are used for traditional agricultural practices. Here we assess the aesthetic quality of an agricultural landscape by integrating social preferences heterogeneity and spatial aspects of the provision, combining subjective and objective perspectives. We work in landscapes dominated by irrigated flowering fruit trees in Cieza, in south-east Spain as it is an excellent example of a semi-arid Mediterranean agroecosystem that delivers multiple ecosystem services, including aesthetic quality, in addition to food production. Using GIS tools and a choice experiment, we assess the social utility function for this landscape, and demonstrate social preferences heterogeneity for demand for the aesthetic qualities of the landscape. Latent class modelling distinguished three populations, with the majority preferring diversified agricultural landscapes and management policies based on a more natural-looking agricultural landscape. These results provide agroecosystem managers with an additional vision focused on enhancing the combination of the most diverse and natural-looking elements in the landscape in order to underpin the delivery of cultural ecosystem services that also increase social well-being.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Can a binary star host three giant circumbinary planets?","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/203180/","Chen, C.; Martin, R.G.; Nixon, C.J.","August 2023","We investigate the orbital stability of a tilted circumbinary planetary system with three giant planets. The planets are spaced by a constant number (Δ) of mutual Hill radii in the range Δ = 3.4–12.0 such that the period ratio of the inner pair is the same as that of the outer pair. A tilted circumbinary planetary system can be unstable even if the same system around a coplanar binary is stable. For an equal-mass binary, we find that the stability of a three-planet system is qualitatively similar to that of a two-planet system, but the three-planet system is more unstable in mean motion resonance regions. For an unequal-mass binary, there is significantly more instability in the three-planet system as the inner planets can undergo von Zeipel–Kozai–Lidov oscillations. Generally in unstable systems, the inner planets are more likely to be ejected than the outer planets. The most likely unstable outcome for closely spaced systems, with Δ ≲ 8, is a single remaining stable planet. For more widely separated systems, Δ ≳ 8, the most likely unstable outcome is two stable planets, only one being ejected. An observed circumbinary planet with significant eccentricity may suggest that it was formed from an unstable system. Consequently, a binary can host three tilted giant planets if the binary stars are close to equal mass and provided that the planets are well spaced and not close to a mean motion resonance.","Ai","University of Leeds"

The saliva samples of healthy subjects were collected before, after and 30 min after tea ingestion. The chemical compositions and antioxidant capacity of tea samples were analyzed to correlate with salivary parameters. Principal component analysis indicated that the effects of vine tea consumption were dominated by increasing salivary flow rate (SFR), production rate of total protein (TPC), thiol (SH), malondialdehyde, catalase activity and antioxidant capacity (FRAP) in saliva. The antioxidant profile of studied tea samples (FRAP, polyphenols, flavonoids) was positively correlated with salivary SFR, TPC, SH and FRAP but negatively correlated with salivary uric acid concentration in saliva.","Ai","University of Leeds"

In flowering plants pollinator specificity can strongly influence gene flow patterns and facilitate speciation. Fig trees are species rich and ecologically significant plants. It was once believed that each species had its own unique pollinator fig wasp, but numerous exceptions are now known. The dioecious Ficus deltoidea complex is distributed across southern South-East Asia with 13 recognised varieties of uncertain status, seven of which are found in Peninsular Malaysia. We investigated the host preferences of one of their Blastophaga pollinators, reared from the epiphytic F. deltoidea var. angustifolia. Our series of experimental manipulations using free-flying fig wasps and figs on host trees showed that male figs were preferred, that only their natal variety was attractive and that pollinators only dispersed from their natal trees if no suitable figs were present there. Fig wasps can only reproduce in male hosts, so preferred entry to male figs has clear advantages for them, as does their reluctance to disperse from natal trees. This behaviour is likely to reduce seed set on female plants, with potential consequences for host population dynamics. The extreme specificity of the Blastophaga sp. suggests gene flow between varieties of F. deltoidea is low or absent and that different varieties may be different biological species.","Ai","University of Leeds"

Performance arts-based methods have been put forward as one way to increase the representation of local values and signalling power differences. Environmental professionals’ validation of these methods is essential as they shape the interpretation, uptake, and implementation of environmental decisions in practice, but their views remain largely unexplored. This paper uses interviews and focus groups with environmental professionals in Mexico to explore their views on whether these methods a) open the space to discuss a plurality of values and power differences within local communities; and b) can contribute to environmental decision-making, particularly with respect to their viability, cultural relevance and credibility. We use a case study applying Forum Theatre in two rural communities. Results indicate that performance arts-based methods provide openings for environmental professionals to identify interconnected values beyond single categories, and they have the potential to encourage local people to discuss power differences that constrain their participation in environmental decision-making. Results also highlight the importance of preparation and design, as well as rigorous ethical processes to carefully approach specific cultural contexts. Environmental professionals were wary of the methods credibility, partly due to disciplinary conventions that still adhere to positivism. Nevertheless, these challenges also demonstrate the possibilities of performance arts-based methods in fostering transformation and emancipation processes, encouraging local people to influence environmental decisions.","Ai","University of Leeds"

Dietary energy density (ED) is primarily decreased by the water and increased by the fat content of foods. Protein, carbohydrates and fat exert different effects on satiety or energy intake (EI) in the order protein &gt; carbohydrates &gt; fat. When the ED of different foods is equalized the differences between fat and carbohydrates are modest. Covertly increasing dietary ED with fat, carbohydrate or mixed macronutrients elevates EI, producing weight gain and vice versa. In more naturalistic situations where learning cues are intact, there appears to be greater compensation for the different ED of foods. There is considerable individual variability in response. Macronutrient-specific negative feedback models of EI regulation have limited capacity to explain how availability of cheap, highly palatable, readily assimilated, energy-dense foods lead to obesity in modern environments. Neuropsychological constructs including food reward (liking, wanting and learning), reactive and reflective decision making, in the context of asymmetric energy balance regulation, give more comprehensive explanations of how environmental superabundance of foods containing mixtures of readily assimilated fats and carbohydrates and caloric beverages elevate EI through combined hedonic, affective, cognitive and physiological mechanisms. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Causes of obesity: theories, conjectures and evidence (Part II)’.","Ai","University of Leeds"

With increasing load, initial plastic deformation and tensile cracking in the scratch track progresses to the propagation of radial and lateral cracks, and full coating spallation. In situ SEM imaging reveals nucleation of radial cracks in the DLC coating around the front and side of the moving asperity, followed by lateral crack propagation both ahead of, and behind, the asperity contact zone. Post-mortem FIB cross sectioning reveals microcracking and lateral cracks in the silicon substrate below DLC coatings prior to coating spallation. The DLC failure mechanisms are influenced by asperity geometry, with notable DLC coating lift up/delamination events occurring during the smaller 1 μm radius asperity scratch tests. The sharper 1 μm radius asperity required ∼20% of the applied load, and higher contact pressure, to initiate spallation during scratching compared the larger 5 μm asperity, indicating that smaller radii asperities are significantly more likely to cause DLC coating spallation, although the spallations they generate were observed to be, on average, smaller.","Ai","University of Leeds"

We investigate these relationships in a postVariscan amphibolite-facies shear zone developed in the mid-low continental crust (Ivrea-Verbano Zone, Southern Alps, Italy). Quantitative orientation analyses along with textural imaging of titanite are combined with trace-element analyses and U–Pb age dating. Titanite is studied in mm- to cmscale layered rocks showing compositional variation consisting of alternating ‘amphibole-rich’ (i.e., amphibolites) and ‘clinopyroxene/plagioclase-rich’ domains (i.e., calc-silicates). Titanite from amphibolerich domains shows predominance of crystal–plastic deformation features, as abrupt or progressive coreto-rim structures characterized by increasing lattice distortion and local dislocation density, associated with the development of abundant subgrains and rare newly nucleated grains. We suggest that these microstructures form while interacting with small amounts of fluids circulating along the grain boundaries. Consequently, locally the chemistry of titanite is changing. In the clinopyroxene/plagioclaserich domains, titanite is mostly undeformed and rarely shows bending localized in discontinuous narrow rims/tips. In these domains, fluid-mediated replacement reactions are either rare or absent, as also indicated by weak chemical variations across and among grains. These observations suggest different reactivities with respect to the same P-T-fluid conditions of the two compositional domains, which coexist within the same sample at the thin section scale. U–Pb data show correlations with chemical and microstructural domains that differ as function of the composition of the microdomain. This correlation is more apparent within amphibole-rich domains where microstructures characterized by high lattice distortion/dislocations and/or subgrains show significant variations of REE, Zr, Y, Nb, U with respect to the low deformed portion of grains. These titanite domains define an isotopic population providing the youngest (Jurassic) lower intercept age. A less clear correlation between titanite chemistry and microstructures is observed in clinopyroxene/plagioclase-rich domains. Here, the rare titanites showing lattice distortion and minor Sr depletion define a population providing a similar Jurassic lower intercept age. Therefore, our results demonstrate that microstructurally and chemical calibrated U–Pb dating of titanite provides realistic ages of shear zone activity, only in case of predominance of crystal-plastic processes and of local interaction of titanite with small amounts of fluids focused along grain boundaries. Finally, the different footprints recorded by titanite grains strongly depend on the composition of cm- or mm-scale interlayered domains in which titanite occurs.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Cyclic landslide-flood chains along a major mountain river.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/201662/","Yang, Y.; Liu, M.; Quincey, D.","July 2023","Landslides are a crucial Earth surface process in mountain landscapes, rapidly transporting large amounts of sediment into lower-elevation areas, and periodically negatively impacting people and their livelihoods. Most studies focus on their immediate, local-scale impacts, but few recognize their remote impacts in mountain environments. In particular, major landslides along rivers can block river channels to form lakes through backwater inundation, posing a flood hazard to downstream areas. In 2018, two landslides occurred along the Baige section of the Jinsha River, eastern Tibetan Plateau, forming two landslide lakes and subsequently, causing two flood events. In this study, we explore the impacts of these events on hillslopes along the river banks, upstream and downstream of the Baige site. Using small baseline subset Interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (SBAS InSAR), we find many active landslides along the Jinsha River and detect a sudden acceleration in these instabilities following the 2018 events. We attribute upstream instabilities to an increase in river width and depth, related to the remains of the landslide dam, while downstream slope instability is likely caused by undercutting along the outburst route. Modelling indicates that failure of these newly detected landslides may block the river again and potentially extend the hazard chain. This work demonstrates that landslides along major rivers can initiate new instabilities, and that even a short-lived landslide-dammed lake can have long-term impacts on stability of hillslopes in river valleys.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Entrapment of probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum) in bilayer emulsion film with enhanced barrier property for improving viability.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199536/","Yang, Z; Li, M; Li, Y","April 2023","The gelatin/gellan gum based-bilayer emulsion film was developed in this work to improve the survivability of Bifidobacterium longum during the storage process. The baobab seed oil (BO) was added to the gelatin (GE) matrix to develop emulsion film as the barrier outer layer. The blueberry anthocyanin extract (BE) was incorporated into the gellan gum (GG)-based inner layer to enhance the viability of B. longum. The SEM and FTIR results revealed that the probiotics were successfully entrapped in BO/BE-loaded bilayer film. The greatest survivability and viable cell numbers of the B. longum during the storage period were observed in the BO/BE loaded bilayer film. Furthermore, the stability of the colorful patterns by electrochemical writing was also evaluated in this work. Finally, the GE/BO-GG/BE/BM maintain satisfactory probiotic viability in steamed bread coating application. Hence, the GE/BO-GG/BE/BM bilayer film could be considered a novel material to deliver and protect the probiotics in food applications.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Dielectric spectroscopy of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal and the effect of the sample thickness.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202166/","Erkoreka, A.; Martinez-Perdiguero, J.; Mandle, R.J.","July 2023","The recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals have been reported to exhibit very large dielectric permittivity values. Here, we report a systematic investigation of the dielectric behavior of a prototypical ferroelectric nematogen by varying the thickness of the parallel capacitor measuring cell. While in the non-polar high temperature nematic phase results show only slight differences due to slight variations of the alignment, the measured permittivity values in the ferroelectric nematic phase show a linear dependence on the cell thickness. It is also shown that the characteristic relaxation frequency decreases inversely proportionally to the thickness. The results are discussed in terms of three different available models based on different underlying mechanisms, accounting for cancellation of the probe electric fields by polarization reorientation or by ionic charges, or based on a recently proposed continuous phenomenological model.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"The role of time budgets in models of multi-tasking while travelling: A comparison between the MDCEV and eMDC approach.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202639/","Palma, D.; Calastri, C.; Pawlak, J.","July 2023","The increasingly widespread use of mobile technologies and connectivity as well as vehicle automation have triggered renewed attention to the issue of productivity and enjoyment of time spent travelling. Rejecting the traditional assumption that travel time is “wasted”, questions of whether improved fruition of time spent travelling can help encourage PT ridership and affect the uptake of autonomous vehicles draw increasing interest. Yet, the investigation of how people spend travel time, especially from a modelling standpoint, is still an emerging field in travel behaviour research. This paper contributes to this area of study by jointly analysing activity engagement and time use while travelling, with a particular focus on multitasking, i.e. conducting activities other than travel. The application of the newly developed extended Multiple Discrete-Continuous (eMDC) model allows the relaxation of the assumption of a defined time budget, allowing the performance of multiple activities at the same time, and permits investigating substitutions and complementarity effects between different activities. The eMDC is found to be more suitable to model multitasking compared to existing approaches because (i) it does not require arbitrarily dropping activities when they are performed at the same time, and (ii) it allows capturing complementarity and substitution effects. By applying the model to the UK Time-Use Survey, we find that social and work activities as well as social and mass media consumption are substitutes while travelling. We also forecast time-use changes under different transport policy scenarios, proving impacts of substitution effects. While eMDC is our preferred approach, we observe that depending on the choice of modelling framework, the results can lead to different conclusions concerning suitability of particular policy measures. Hence, for future applications, testing of different frameworks is advised to assess sensitivity of the conclusions to the implicit modelling assumptions.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Reducing industrial hydrogen demand through preheating with very high temperature heat pumps.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202234/","Pimm, A.J.; Cockerill, T.T.; Gale, W.F.","June 2023","Decarbonising industry while maintaining economic competitiveness and improving living standards is one of the main challenges of reaching net zero targets, and low-carbon process heating will play a key role in this. In this work we investigate the potential to reduce the energy demands of hydrogen-based industrial heating systems using very high temperature reverse Joule-Brayton cycle heat pumps as preheaters, considering their economics and technical challenges. A thermodynamic process model is used to assess performance at temperatures of 300–500 °C, and cost optimisation is used to conduct cost-benefit analysis of preheating green hydrogen using heat pumps. It is found that over this temperature range, heat pump coefficient of performance lies in the range 1.4–1.7, with the turbine meeting 30–40% of the compressor load. At the electricity prices currently paid by heavy industry in Western Europe, levelised cost of heat from these heat pumps would be less than 4.5p/kWh. Using 500 °C heat pumps as preheaters in hydrogen heating systems could reduce hydrogen demands by over 20% and provide savings on the cost of green hydrogen of at least 8% out to 2050. With process heat accounting for three-quarters of industrial energy use and half of this being at temperatures above 400 °C, these savings are significant and suggest that very high temperature heat pumps could make an important contribution to industrial decarbonisation.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Haptic technology in society: A sentiment analysis of public engagement.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/201766/","Al-Samarraie, H.; Sarsam, S.M.; Alzahrani, A.I.","June 2023","With the rapid rise of metaverse spaces, the integration of haptic technology has become an integral part of users' immersion and engagement in different domains. This study shades the light on public engagement with haptic technology applications in various contexts. The YouTube Application Programming Interface was used to extract data about haptic technology within a specific time period. Public engagement was estimated based on users' cognitive and behavioral engagement with haptic-video materials. A topic modeling approach was used to extract the main topics associated with haptic technology. The main types of users’ emotions and their word association were extracted using the association rules mining technique. The results showed that public engagement with haptic technology was mostly observed in few categories (e.g., gaming). Joy and positive sentiments were strongly associated with the extracted topics. The findings offer new insights into the tendency of utilizing haptic technology across communities. The outcomes can help industries and decision makers understand ways to improve the integration of haptic technology in according to the needs of specific domains.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Stereotypes and the public acceptability of shared micromobility.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202159/","An, Z.; Mullen, C.; Zhao, C.","July 2023","Understanding the public's views and acceptability of shared micromobility (SMM) is crucial for uncovering barriers to incorporating SMM into sustainable urban mobility. This research studies stereotypes of SMM and their impacts on SMM's public acceptability. We focus on shared e-scooters and shared bikes/e-bikes in England, the Netherlands, and Sweden. We conceptualise stereotypes of SMM, developing a scale for their measurement. Factor analysis reveals that stereotypes of SMM are structured around two cognitive dimensions, namely, warmth and competence, which aligns with the stereotype content model. Warmth captures individuals' stereotyped SMM user images regarding how the users interact with other road users; competence reflects individuals' stereotyped SMM's capabilities to improve existing transport systems. Overall, stereotypes of SMM, characterised by low levels of warmth and high levels of competence, are ambivalent. Yet, they are also variable. Analysis of covariance unveils variations in SMM stereotypes across countries, sociodemographics, and travel patterns. Swedish residents, older adults, individuals from households without children, SMM users, and car-oriented individuals hold lower levels of warmth (for both types of SMM) and competence (for shared e-scooters) than their counterparts. Finally, the public acceptability of shared e-scooters is neutral, whilst that of shared bikes/e-bikes is mildly positive. Multivariate analyses show that stereotypes' warmth and competence are positively associated with individuals' acceptability of SMM, cumulatively accounting for over 50% of the variation in acceptability. Our findings help inform policies and planning on SMM. The developed scale holds the potential for evaluating stereotypes of SMM in particular and emerging transport services in general.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"A Continuation Technique for Maximum Likelihood Estimators in Biological Models.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/203069/","Cassidy, T.","August 2023","Estimating model parameters is a crucial step in mathematical modelling and typically involves minimizing the disagreement between model predictions and experimental data. This calibration data can change throughout a study, particularly if modelling is performed simultaneously with the calibration experiments, or during an on-going public health crisis as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, the optimal parameter set, or maximal likelihood estimator (MLE), is a function of the experimental data set. Here, we develop a numerical technique to predict the evolution of the MLE as a function of the experimental data. We show that, when considering perturbations from an initial data set, our approach is significantly more computationally efficient that re-fitting model parameters while producing acceptable model fits to the updated data. We use the continuation technique to develop an explicit functional relationship between fit model parameters and experimental data that can be used to measure the sensitivity of the MLE to experimental data. We then leverage this technique to select between model fits with similar information criteria, a priori determine the experimental measurements to which the MLE is most sensitive, and suggest additional experiment measurements that can resolve parameter uncertainty.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Retail returns management strategy: An alignment perspective.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202371/","Karlsson, S.; Oghazi, P.; Hellstrom, D.","July 2023","This research aims to shed light on the formulation of returns management strategies and to identify key returns management components in developing more effective returns management strategies. Anchored in supply chain orientation and supply chain alignment research, we use a multiple confirmatory case study of six retailers operating in online commerce. Interviews with fifteen managers provided the primary empirical data source for the study. The results confirm the presence of alignment in establishing effective strategies for managing product returns and suggest a return policy. The findings provide detailed insights into seven existing misalignments that curb the strength of alignment. These serve as strategic elements for managers to consider in formulating returns management strategies and goals. The results may assist retail and supply chain professionals in their quest to develop effective strategies for managing product returns. Research on returns management strategy is scarce. This study offers a conceptual framework and provides new empirical insights into returns management strategy formulation and, in particular, potential misalignments.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Rapid identification of in vitro cell toxicity using an electrochemical membrane screening platform.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200463/","Kohl, Y; William, N; Elje, E","May 2023","This study compares the performance and output of an electrochemical phospholipid membrane platform against respective in vitro cell-based toxicity testing methods using three toxicants of different biological action (chlorpromazine (CPZ), colchicine (COL) and methyl methanesulphonate (MMS)). Human cell lines from seven different tissues (lung, liver, kidney, placenta, intestine, immune system) were used to validate this physicochemical testing system. For the cell-based systems, the effective concentration at 50 % cell death (EC₅₀) values are calculated. For the membrane sensor, a limit of detection (LoD) value was extracted as a quantitative parameter describing the minimum concentration of toxicant which significantly affects the structure of the phospholipid sensor membrane layer. LoD values were found to align well with the EC₅₀ values when acute cell viability was used as an end-point and showed a similar toxicity ranking of the tested toxicants. Using the colony forming efficiency (CFE) or DNA damage as end-point, a different order of toxicity ranking was observed. The results of this study showed that the electrochemical membrane sensor generates a parameter relating to biomembrane damage, which is the predominant factor in decreasing cell viability when in vitro models are acutely exposed to toxicants. These results lead the way to using electrochemical membrane-based sensors for rapid relevant preliminary toxicity screens.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Hindrances and outcomes of social bonding in exporter-importer relationships: The moderating role of formal contracting and ethical climate.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202901/","Leonidou, L.C.; Aykol, B.; Fotiadis, T.A.","July 2023","Drawing on Transaction Cost theory, Relational Exchange theory, and Social Information Processing theory, we develop and test a conceptual model that investigates the damaging effect of certain key behavioral factors on social bonding between an exporter and its import buyer, and its subsequent impact on the exporting firm's long-term orientation in their working relationship. We also examine the moderating role of formal contracting and ethical climate governing this relationship. The model was tested with data collected from 262 Greek export manufacturers, using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that opportunism, distance, and conflict negatively affect social bonding in the working relationship between an exporter and its importer customer, which ultimately leads to detrimental effects on the exporting firm's long-term orientation. However, both the existence of formal contracting and the prevalence of a strong ethical climate were found to be responsible for alleviating the negative effect of most of the associations between inhibiting behavioral factors and social bonding.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Particle behavior in a turbulent pipe flow with a flat bed.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/195821/","Liu, M; Zhao, Y; Yan, Y","December 2022","Particle behavior in a turbulent flow in a circular pipe with a bed height h = 0.5R is studied at Reb = 40,000 and for two sizes of particles (5 μm and 50 μm) using large eddy simulation, one-way coupled with a Lagrangian particle tracking technique. Turbulent secondary flows are found within the pipe, with the curved upper wall affecting the secondary flow formation giving rise to a pair of large upper vortices above two smaller vortices close to the pipe floor. The behavior of the two sizes of particle is found to be quite different. The 50 μm particles deposit forming irregular elongated particle streaks close to the pipe floor, particularly at the center of the flow and the pipe corners due to the impact of the secondary flows. The deposition and resuspension rate of the 5 μm particles is high near the center of the floor and at the pipe corners, while values for the 50 μm particles are greatest near the corners. Near the curved upper wall of the pipe, the deposition rate of the 5 μm particles increases in moving from the wall center to the corners, and is greater than that for the larger particles due to the effects of the secondary flow. The maximum resuspension rate of the smaller particles occurs above the pipe corners, with the 50 μm particles showing their highest resuspension rate above and at the corners of the pipe.","Ai","University of Leeds"
"Using smart card data to model public transport user profiles in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200707/","Lizana, M; Choudhury, C; Watling, D","June 2023","The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented impact on public transport demand. Even though several studies have investigated the change in the use of public transport during the pandemic, most existing studies where large passive datasets have been considered focus on the drop in ridership at the aggregate level. To address this gap, this research aims to identify and model profiles of passengers considering their public transport recovery after the long-term lockdown in Santiago, Chile, during the early stage of the pandemic. The methodology proposed a three-stage approach associated with the analysis of smart card records. First, cardholder residential areas were identified to enrich the available data by integrating demographic information from the census. Then, a clustering analysis was applied to recognise distinctive classes of users based on their public transport usage change between the pre-pandemic and the post-lockdown phase. Finally, two different models were implemented to uncover the relationships between class membership and travellers’ characteristics (i.e. travel history and demographic characteristics of their residential area). Results revealed a heterogeneous recovery of public transport usage among passengers, summarising them into two recognisable classes: those who mainly returned to their pre-pandemic patterns and those who adapted their mobility profiles. A statistically significant association of travel history with the mobility adaptation profile was found, as well as with aggregate socio-demographic attributes. These insights about the extent of heterogeneity and its drivers can help in the formulation of specific policies associated with public transport supply in the post-pandemic era.","Ai","University of Leeds"
