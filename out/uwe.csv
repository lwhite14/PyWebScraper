"Evaluation criteria for construction waste management tools: Towards a holistic BIM framework","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/801782/evaluation-criteria-for-construction-waste-management-tools-towards-a-holistic-bim-framework","Saheed O. Ajayi;  Olugbenga Akinade;  Lukumon Oyedele;  Kamran Munir;  Muhammad Bilal;  Hakeem Owolabi; Hafiz A. Alaka; Sururah A. Bello","Jan 2, 2016","© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. This study identifies evaluation criteria with the goal of appraising the performance of existing construction waste management tools and employing the results in the development of a holistic building information modelling (BIM) framework for construction waste management. Based on the literature, this paper identifies 32 construction waste management tools in five categories: (a) waste management plan templates and guides, (b) waste data collection and audit tools (c) waste quantification models, (d) waste prediction tools, and (e) geographic information system (GIS)-enabled waste tools. After reviewing these tools and conducting four focus-group interviews (FGIs), the findings revealed six categories of evaluation criteria (a) waste prediction; (b) waste data; (c) commercial and procurement; (d) BIM; (e) design; and (f) technological. The performance of the tools is assessed using the evaluation criteria and the result reveals that the existing tools are not robust enough to tackle construction waste management at the design stage. The paper therefore discusses the development of a holistic BIM framework with six layers: application; service domain; BIM business domain; presentation; data; and infrastructure. The BIM framework provides a holistic approach and organizes relevant knowledge required to tackle construction waste effectively at the design stage using an architecture-based layered approach. This framework will be of interest to software developers and BIM practitioners who seek to extend the functionalities of existing BIM software for construction waste management.","Tech","University of the West of England"
"The politics of redeployment: Malleable technologies and the localisation of anticipatory calculation","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/801847/the-politics-of-redeployment-malleable-technologies-and-the-localisation-of-anticipatory-calculation","Nat O'Grady","Dec 22, 2015","This book chapter is a contribution to the book Algorithmic Life: Calculative Devices in an Age of Big Data. The chapter examines processes through which commercially available credit checking software has been acquired and customized by the UK Fire and Rescue Service for the purposes of risk analysis and, ultimately risk governance. I argue in the chapter that the case is indicative of broader phenomenon in which digital technologies are redeployed for purposes other than that which they were designed for. This redeployment carries with it new political complications for the organisations partaking in it: from the development of new forms of subjectivity to being caught up in broader controversies related to dataveillance that an age of so-called Big Data redefines anew.","Tech","University of the West of England"
"2D and 3D computer vision analysis of gaze, gender and age","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/801890/2d-and-3d-computer-vision-analysis-of-gaze-gender-and-age","Wenhao Zhang","None","Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has been an active research area for over four decades. Research studies and commercial designs in this area have been largely facilitated by the visual modality which brings diversified functionality and improved usability to HCI interfaces by employing various computer vision techniques. This thesis explores a number of facial cues, such as gender, age and gaze, by performing 2D and 3D based computer vision analysis. The ultimate aim is to create a natural HCI strategy that can fulfil user expectations, augment user satisfaction and enrich user experience by understanding user characteristics and behaviours. To this end, salient features have been extracted and analysed from 2D and 3D face representations; 3D reconstruction algorithms and their compatible real-world imaging systems have been investigated; case study HCI systems have been designed to demonstrate the reliability, robustness, and applicability of the proposed method.  More specifically, an unsupervised approach has been proposed to localise eye centres in images and videos accurately and efficiently. This is achieved by utilisation of two types of geometric features and eye models, complemented by an iris radius constraint and a selective oriented gradient filter specifically tailored to this modular scheme. This approach resolves challenges such as interfering facial edges, undesirable illumination conditions, head poses, and the presence of facial accessories and makeup. Tested on 3 publicly available databases (the BioID database, the GI4E database and the extended Yale Face Database b), and a self-collected database, this method outperforms all the methods in comparison and thus proves to be highly accurate and robust. Based on this approach, a gaze gesture recognition algorithm has been designed to increase the interactivity of HCI systems by encoding eye saccades into a communication channel similar to the role of hand gestures. As well as analysing eye/gaze data that represent user behaviours and reveal user intentions, this thesis also investigates the automatic recognition of user demographics such as gender and age. The Fisher Vector encoding algorithm is employed to construct visual vocabularies as salient features for gender and age classification. Algorithm evaluations on three publicly available databases (the FERET database, the LFW database and the FRCVv2 database) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in both laboratory and unconstrained environments. In order to achieve enhanced robustness, a two-source photometric stereo method has been introduced to recover surface normals such that more invariant 3D facia features become available that can further boost classification accuracy and robustness. A 2D+3D imaging system has been designed for construction of a self-collected dataset including 2D and 3D facial data. Experiments show that utilisation of 3D facial features can increase gender classification rate by up to 6% (based on the self-collected dataset), and can increase age classification rate by up to 12% (based on the Photoface database). Finally, two case study HCI systems, a gaze gesture based map browser and a directed advertising billboard, have been designed by adopting all the proposed algorithms as well as the fully compatible imaging system. Benefits from the proposed algorithms naturally ensure that the case study systems can possess high robustness to head pose variation and illumination variation; and can achieve excellent real-time performance. Overall, the proposed HCI strategy enabled by reliably recognised facial cues can serve to spawn a wide array of innovative systems and to bring HCI to a more natural and intelligent state.","Tech","University of the West of England"

"Development and validation of a high throughput, closed tube method for the determination of haemoglobin alpha gene (HBA1 and HBA2) numbers by gene ratio assay copy enumeration-PCR (GRACE-PCR)","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/801943/development-and-validation-of-a-high-throughput-closed-tube-method-for-the-determination-of-haemoglobin-alpha-gene-hba1-and-hba2-numbers-by-gene-ratio-assay-copy-enumeration-pcr-grace-pcr","Andrew Turner; Jurgen Sasse;  Aniko Varadi","Dec 18, 2015","© 2015 Turner et al. Background: Deletions of the aα-globin genes are the most common genetic abnormalities in the world. Currently multiplex Gap-PCRs are frequently used to identify specific sets of common deletions. However, these assays require significant post-amplification hands on time and cannot be used to identify novel or unexpected deletions. The aim of the current study was to develop a rapid screening test for the detection of all deletions of the aα-globin genes that can be integrated into a high volume clinical laboratory workflow. Methods: A gene ratio assay copy enumeration (GRACE) PCR method was developed by simultaneous amplification of targets in the aα-globin genes (HBA1 and HBA2) and the chloride channel voltage sensitive 7 (CLCN7) reference gene. A novel application of High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis then allowed rapid determination of aα-globin gene copy numbers. The assay was validated using 105 samples with previously determined and 62 samples with unknown aα-globin genotypes. Results: The GRACE-PCR assay detected abnormal aα-globin gene copy numbers in 108 of the 167 samples evaluated. The results were consistent with those from a commercial reverse hybridization assay and no allele drop out was observed. Conclusions: We have successfully developed and validated a GRACE-PCR screening test for the detection of deletions and duplications of the aα-globin genes. The assay is based on copy number determination and has the ability to detect both known and novel deletions of the aα-globin genes. It is a closed tube technique; consequently the risk of amplicon contamination is negligible. Amplification, detection and analysis can be completed within one hour, making it faster, cheaper and simpler than other existing tests and thus well suited as a rapid first step in a clinical laboratory workflow.","Tech","University of the West of England"
"Austen writing Bristol: The city and signification in Northanger Abbey and Emma","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/801985/austen-writing-bristol-the-city-and-signification-in-northanger-abbey-and-emma"," Gill Ballinger","Dec 16, 2015","This essay suggests that Austen’s portrayal of Bristol in her fiction has two specific functions. First, it underscores her topographical realism: the references to the city and its immediate environs show how her novels are set in the recognizably real world, even if Bristol is not described in great detail. Second, a character’s attitude towards, or connection with, the city and its surrounding area exposes significant aspects of his or her personality. A character’s relationship to place reveals a great deal; furthermore, the aspect of temperament that is exposed in the process may be linked to important wider themes of the particular novel in question. The connection between place and person is part of Austen’s “hyperrealistic” method, a technique whereby she used real life places and their associations to help inform an understanding of her characters (Barchas 9).","Tech","University of the West of England"
"A proposed model for servitization based collaboration in the UK Aerospace Defence industry","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/802094/a-proposed-model-for-servitization-based-collaboration-in-the-uk-aerospace-defence-industry","Neil Barnett","None","In many sectors customers are increasingly seeking service contracts rather than buying products. High tech capital equipment firms attracted by the potential revenue benefits are choosing to move from supplying product only to supplying product and services. This concept is known as ‘Servitization’. Through empirical evidence the academic literature has shown that businesses face challenges in undertaking the transformation from product to service provision and that organisational, cultural, commercial and operational challenges have the potential to erode the desired and expected benefits sought from such a transition. The research presented in this thesis investigates and identifies the features and challenges of servitization in the context of a complex engineering service provided by the UK Aerospace Defence industry. The research also explores the reported costs and front of mind costs for the provision of a complex engineering service. Particular attention is given to the problem of less than expected profitability during and post transformation to service. This research adopts a qualitative approach through the use of a single case study with multiple case examples of the complex engineering service. Findings identify a number of challenges associated with the transformation from product to service provision that include strategy, organisation and enterprise management, contracting, risk, culture and operations. Considering these findings holistically it is suggested that a paradigm shift needs to occur, changing both managers perspective and the business models employed if the firm is to provide a sustainable service offering. New ways of structuring and managing the enterprise to deliver the service value proposition will be required. This will include the development of performance management of all operations across the enterprise required as a minimum to ensure optimum performance of service delivery at lowest cost.","Tech","University of the West of England"
"A review of the Malaysian film industry: Towards better film workflow","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/802102/a-review-of-the-malaysian-film-industry-towards-better-film-workflow","Abdul Riezal Dim","None","Abstract This thesis investigates the existing film workflow processes in Malaysia and aims to explore, review and reflect on the expectations, experiences and preferences and problems experienced by practitioners in the Malaysian film industry. Part of that exploration is an in-depth examination of real practices of colour film workflow, investigating the common myth amongst Malaysian filmmakers that environmental colour temperature affects the image quality of Malaysian films. Analysis of this myth may help to establish why many Malaysian films have been processed through foreign laboratory facilities using foreign expertise. The argument and analysis are based on background analysis and interviewing using video documentation of Malaysian film workflow practices, which provides valuable data for the benefit of the Malaysian film industry. All the processes and evidence from the Malaysian film industry were recorded through qualitative video documentation, alongside quantitative data from filmstrip testing. This mixed action research method forms the main approach together with the use of participatory action research as a tool to narrate the development of the research. In justifying the use of all the data, an explanatory mixed method design has been applied. Indeed, the cooperation with expert witnesses in finding a solution to the research problem brought to the circle of practice-based research processes that validated the research. This validation becoming a central of investigation about the Malaysian film workflow complication. The initial technique (pursing the myth of colour temperature variation) proved inadequate, and, consequently, a broader action research methodology was adopted. As such, the filmstrip test data were used more as a tool to enhance the contributions of the expert witnesses, thereby shifting the direction and strengthening the research findings. It is hoped that the methods used could be transferred to solve other film industry problems This research also proves that the method applied has created new evidence of knowledge transfer in historical and film development context, which benefits the film industry in Malaysia. This development of new knowledge could provide a significant opportunity for future potential research, which will strengthen the colour workflow processes and lead to the development of film practices in Malaysia and the surrounding areas. It is the aim of this research to suggest solutions to the current problems of workflow practices among educators, government agencies and filmmakers in the Malaysian film industry.","Tech","University of the West of England"

From the noticeboard in the newsagent’s window to multi-layered online networks using social networking technologies, citizens are increasingly accessing networks of support that uncover previously invisible opportunities.    Such networks exist online and offline, facilitated in part by the use of social networking platforms but also through the everyday face-to-face interactions of localities. These networks are complex and dynamic and in this chapter we present two case studies where the micro-level actions of creative citizens generate impact within their communities and beyond.   We consider how such actions, supported by and amplified by networks, often have wider impacts for the creative economy and for the relationship between citizens and those in power.","Tech","University of the West of England"
"Social epistemology and online knowledge exchange","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/802272/social-epistemology-and-online-knowledge-exchange","Dr Paul Matthews","None","This document summarises the submitted research which has investigated online knowledge exchange and related it to the philosophical field of social epistemology. The broad aims have been: firstly to investigate what social epistemology theory can offer in the way of guidance and evaluative frameworks for the design of knowledge systems; and secondly, to determine what the empirical study of knowledge exchange platforms can tell us about epistemology as emerging from online practice. The submitted work consists of six papers that are a mixture of review/position papers and reports of empirical investigation. These have been published in information science journals and conference proceedings. However, following the established tradition of information science, the work is positioned as being cross disciplinary in ambition.  After introducing the submitted papers and the inspiration for the research, the main theoretical positions of the research are outlined and justified. These were a naturalised social epistemological position, inspired by Alvin Goldman, but widened to a situated and systems-oriented view. The naturalised view of epistemology allows for consideration of evidence from psychology, and here some key theories in social and cognitive psychology are outlined. Finally, as the subject is human-computer-human interaction, the sociotechnical setting is established. Further, the main platforms of study in the empirical work — social question answering systems — are introduced and described.  The main methodology and research approaches followed are presented next. A mixed methods philosophy was deemed suitable for this area of research and — alongside the review work — the broad web science method of combining network and data investigation with qualitative methods is justified. Review work included early collaborations with an information scientist and a philosopher which helped to bring together and clarify epistemological and sociotechnical themes.   The discussion section presents some of the main themes and conclusions of the submitted work, including: 1) The identification of knowledge patterns and practices online; 2) Criteria for online knowledge exchange distilled from the social epistemology literature; 3) Some triangulations where theory from philosophy and psychology seemed to corroborate and serve to explain online behaviour; 4) Socio-temporal aspects to online knowledge exchange that are perhaps under developed in philosophy but apparent in practice; 5) Credibility cues and bias, seen as crucial to a rounded study of user interaction with online sources; and finally 6) Interventions suggested by the research which would aim to raise the quality and effectiveness of social media knowledge systems.  Finally, conclusions and suggestions for further work are presented. These follow on from the submitted strands of research and present possibilities for how the work may be extended and improved upon.  In common with the research, these combine philosophy, modelling, interaction design and qualitative methods. Such a combination is seen as essential to developing an enhanced understanding of how the web serves and could serve as a platform for human knowledge.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Using field visits, interviews with locals and experts, and literature reviews, we explored a successful programme of community-based groundwater recharge in three adjacent catchments (the Arvari, Sarsa and Baghani) in semi-arid north Rajasthan, India, led by the NGO Tarun Bharat Sangh (TBS) in order to determine how successes were achieved and could be replicated.  TBS-led initiatives rebuilt traditional village governance structures and participation in community-designed and maintained water harvesting structures (WHSs), which were efficient both economically and in technical design using indigenous knowledge.  Enhanced seasonal groundwater recharge enabled by WHSs regenerated aquatic, farmed and natural ecosystems, underpinning a positive cycle of interdependent social and economic regeneration.  Locally appropriate, integrated social and technical solutions maintaining this positive cycle have increased the quality of ecosystems and the wellbeing of local people.  We used the STEEP (Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political) framework to stratify outcomes, exploring principles underpinning successful local and catchment-scale regeneration and drawing out lessons transferrable to similarly water-stressed regions.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Owolana;  Colin Booth","Apr 2, 2016","© 2016 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press. This study investigates stakeholder opinions of the major benefits and barriers of Environmental Management Systems (EMS) to the Nigerian construction industry, and the perceived issues to EMS adoption among organisations in the industry. The study highlights the environment as an important stakeholder in the industry because it affects and is affected by construction activities on a regular basis. It identifies the importance of ISO 14001 in ensuring adequate consideration for the environment is maintained on construction projects. The research adopts a quantitative approach by analysing responses from an online survey among construction industry professionals in Nigeria. The questions on the survey were drawn from a similar study carried out in Asia and the results were analysed using the Weighted Average and Standard Deviation statistical approach. Results reveal that the major benefits of EMS to the Nigerian construction industry were improved efficiency in waste management and environmental protection, as well as an overall increase in employee motivation due to better opportunities for training and development. Lack of technological support in organisations and the high cost of implementing EMS were viewed as the major barriers towards its uptake in construction companies. The findings also indicate that a feasible EMS implementation strategy must not ignore the unique nature of the Nigerian construction industry, which comprises mostly small and medium enterprises. The study concludes by recommending the use of a waste management plan based on the Reuse-Reduce-Recycle-Recover model and an employee training plan to ensure continuous improvement in the organisation’s environmental management strategy.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Moffat; Dr Danielle Sinnett;  Nicholas Smith; Sarah Burgess","Nov 27, 2015","From its origins in nineteenth-century parks green, infrastructure has been an ever-evolving component of cities. This chapter makes some observations based on a number of key trends in society and emerging patterns of green infrastructure provision to make some suggestions for the future. It looks at how our cities and their citizens are changing and the response required if green infrastructure, in terms of its form and function, is to remain relevant. In addition to our cities shaping green infrastructure, it in turn has a fundamental role to play in future-proofing our cities from challenges, such as climate change, and threats to natural ecosystems and their services on which our health and well-being depend. The management of green infrastructure is also likely to evolve the future, particularly in times of austerity, and require ever greater degrees of collaboration between professions and sectors. However, the future, it is argued, also holds new opportunities for green infrastructure, for example, in terms of new technologies to improve is delivery, streamline its management and monitoring, and facilitate community involvement. What is clear is that green infrastructure will need to be a flexible and dynamic resource that is capable of adapting to cities of the future.","Tech","University of the West of England"

The increasing popularity of the social networking service, Twitter, has made it more involved in day-to-day communications, strengthening social relationships and information dissemination. Conversations on Twitter are now being explored as indicators within early warning systems to alert of imminent natural disasters such as earthquakes and aid prompt emergency responses to crime. Producers are privileged to have limitless access to market perception from consumer comments on social media and microblogs. Targeted advertising can be made more effective based on user profile information such as demography, interests and location. While these applications have proven beneficial, the ability to effectively infer the location of Twitter users has even more immense value. However, accurately identifying where a message originated from or an author's location remains a challenge, thus essentially driving research in that regard. In this paper, we survey a range of techniques applied to infer the location of Twitter users from inception to state of the art. We find significant improvements over time in the granularity levels and better accuracy with results driven by refinements to algorithms and inclusion of more spatial features.","Tech","University of the West of England"

The hand layup of pre-impregnated woven materials is still a large part of the composite manufacturing industry, requiring the skills and experience of a human workforce to form flat plies into complex shapes. It is capable of producing high performance and complex parts, but can be an expensive and variable process. Despite its importance, there appears to have been very little research into the actual methods and techniques used by workers to manipulate flat sheets of composite material into shape during layup. This work presents the first known detailed study of the approach and techniques used by laminators. Four participants laid up onto 15 different shaped molds that replicated features commonly found on composite components. The actions used in layup were grouped into eight distinct techniques. Use of these techniques across tasks of different geometry, ramp angles, radii and drape path was identified using video analysis techniques from the ergonomics field. This revealed strong links between specific features and techniques, revealing a systematic approach to layup. This has enabled the first step toward producing a design for manufacture knowledge base surrounding hand layup. This could then be used to inform the development of the layup process, improve training methods and assist in the design of future automated solutions.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Although iodine is not essential for plants, they take it up readily and, in foodchains, are significant sources of iodine for organisms with an essential requirement for it. During several nuclear accidents radioiodine has been an important component of releases of radioactivity and has caused serious contamination of foodchains. Differences in iodine uptake by different plant taxa are, therefore, important to nutritional and radioecological studies. Using techniques we have developed for a range of other elements, we analyzed inter-taxa differences in radioiodine uptake by 103 plant species and between varieties of two species, and analyzed them using a recent, phylogenetically-informed, taxonomy. The results show that there are significant differences in uptake above and below the species level. There are significant differences between Monocots and Eudicots in iodine uptake, and, in particular, hierarchical ANOVA revealed significant differences between Genera within Families. These analyses of the taxonomic origin of differences in plant uptake of iodine can help the prediction of crop contamination with radioiodine and the management of stable iodine in crops for nutritional purposes.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Cell be- haviour and gene expression depend on the culture en- vironment where three dimensional (3D) cultures have signi cant impact on cells compared to the traditional two dimensional (2D) (2). In this study, expression and stability of 12 common reference genes were evaluated in the immortalized stromal cell line HS-5 in 2D and 3D (Biomerix, Nano ber and Alvetex) cultures. In addition, gene stability was evaluated in cultures with and without exposure to 32.8 μM melphalan, for one hour. The stabil- ity of the candidate genes were determined by RT-qPCR with analysis by geNorm and NormFinder. The most high- ly expressed genes in normal culture were: 2D (EIF4A2, 35.3 ± 0.2), Biomerix (EIF4A2, 32.1 ± 0.9), Nano ber (ATP5B, 37.05±0.0), and Alvetex (ACTB, 36.641±0.5).

According to the stability value determined by Norm nder the high- est stability value without drug was 2D (EIF4A2, 0.01), Biomerix (CYC1/EIF4A2), Nano ber (YWHAI, 0.055), and Alvetex (YWHAI/18s, 0.206), for the melphalan- exposed culture was 2D (YWHAZ, 0.078), Biomerix (YWHAZ/β2M, 0.01), Nano ber (18s/UBS, 0.123), and Alvetex (18s/UBS/β2M, 0.213). In conclusion, culture technique and treatment have a signi cant impact on reference gene expression. Thus it is essential to analyse the housekeeping genes for each experimental condition to determine the most suitable reference gene to be used within the comparative analysis of toxicity responses.","Tech","University of the West of England"

This starts with selecting an appropriate cell source and growth envi- ronment. Primary cells isolated from healthy donors have low proliferation rate and lack homogeneity that can result in experimental variation. This study evaluated the immor- talized stromal cell line HS-5 as an alternative cell source and evaluated their behaviour in the 3D culture. This study compared cell morphology, plastic adherence and expres- sion of surface markers of HS-5 vs. primary cells. Also it evaluated culture medium to improve cell growth and preserve cell characteristics to as close as possible to the in vivo conditions. Inoculation techniques into the matrix (Biomerix, Nano ber and Alvetex) were evaluated, as well as cell retrieval from the 3D system for further investiga- tion. The results indicate that both HS-5 and primary cells meet the criteria for MSC demonstrating plastic adherence, correct cluster of differentiation marker (CD) expression and  broblastic morphology; however cells are rounded in 3D culture. BM-MSCs were not able to penetrate into the nano bre; however, HS-5 cells penetrated and grew in- side the nano bre but with different morphology to cells in other scaffolds. HS-5 grows best in high glucose DMEM medium supplemented with 11% heat inactivated FBS and 2mM L-glutamine. Under these conditions HS-5 adhere well to the scaffolds at room temperature and are easily retrieved using trypsin solution whereas primary cells need up to 120 and 90 minutes to adhere to Nano ber and Biomerix, respectively. HS-5 proliferation rate, size and CD expression decreased in the 3D compared to the 2D. It was noted that some cells escaped the scaffolds and formed a 2D monolayer.

"The role of fine urban grain in securing the diversity of the urban centre","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/803683/the-role-of-fine-urban-grain-in-securing-the-diversity-of-the-urban-centre","Conor A. Norton","None","Diversity is a key concept in urban and planning theory and policy with important physical,social and economic dimensions. It is also central to the sustainable city and a key component of vital and viable urban centres. Urban form plays a key role in physical diversity, however, its relationship with other social and economic aspects of diversity remains poorly understood. Urban grain is a key part of the urban form of all places, and it too has suffered from a lack of research and investigation. Urban grain is essentially a description of the pattern of plots in an urban block and when this pattern is dominated by small plots it is described as fine urban grain. Fine urban grain is notable as it is surrounded by numerous claims about the range of benefits that it provides for mix of use, mix of ownership, mix of business, streetscape and street life in the urban centre. These claims are very significant as they are all, in one way or another, related to the important concept of diversity. In spite of the significance of the claims, there is a lack of awareness of the role and potential benefits of fine urban grain for diversity, particularly in practice. This, alongside current processes of urban planning and property development, is slowly but surely leading to a depletion of fine urban grain in many urban centres in Ireland and Britain. A greater understanding of fine urban grain and its benefits is urgently required as its continued loss may irreversibly damage the diversity that all urban centres rely on for their survival.  This research explores the role of fine urban grain in securing the diversity of the urban centre. In particular, it explores the rhetorical claims linking fine urban grain and mix of use, mix of ownership and mix of business. The lack of empirical evidence behind these claims is a significant gap in the knowledge in this area and a part of a larger issue around the need for more research on urban form, particularly at the local level. A case study approach, investigating two precincts in Dublin city centre, is adopted for the research and it utilises a range of existing and new techniques for data collection and analysis. Significantly, new advanced spatial analysis techniques for measuring urban grain and mix of use are developed for this research. The findings show the robustness of research methodology and present significant new evidence in this area. The research highlights the implications of the findings for theory and practice and it makes recommendations for change in current planning practice. The research also identifies areas where further investigation would help to reduce further the knowledge gaps in this area.","Tech","University of the West of England"
"Assessing the performance of maternity care in Europe: A critical exploration of tools and indicators","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/803725/assessing-the-performance-of-maternity-care-in-europe-a-critical-exploration-of-tools-and-indicators"," Escuriet;  Jo White; Katrien Beeckman; Lucy Frith; Fatima Leon-Larios; Christine Loytved; Ans Luyben; Marlene Sinclair; Edwin Van Teijlingen","Nov 2, 2015","© 2015 Escuriet et al. Background: This paper critically reviews published tools and indicators currently used to measure maternity care performance within Europe, focusing particularly on whether and how current approaches enable systematic appraisal of processes of minimal (or non-) intervention in support of physiological or ""normal birth"". The work formed part of COST Actions IS0907: ""Childbirth Cultures, Concerns, and Consequences: Creating a dynamic EU framework for optimal maternity care"" (2011-2014) and IS1405: Building Intrapartum Research Through Health - an interdisciplinary whole system approach to understanding and contextualising physiological labour and birth (BIRTH) (2014-). The Actions included the sharing of country experiences with the aim of promoting salutogenic approaches to maternity care. Methods: A structured literature search was conducted of material published between 2005 and 2013, incorporating research databases, published documents in english in peer-reviewed international journals and indicator databases which measured aspects of health care at a national and pan-national level. Given its emergence from two COST Actions the work, inevitably, focused on Europe, but findings may be relevant to other countries and regions. Results: A total of 388 indicators were identified, as well as seven tools specifically designed for capturing aspects of maternity care. Intrapartum care was the most frequently measured feature, through the application of process and outcome indicators. Postnatal and neonatal care of mother and baby were the least appraised areas. An over-riding focus on the quantification of technical intervention and adverse or undesirable outcomes was identified. Vaginal birth (no instruments) was occasionally cited as an indicator; besides this measurement few of the 388 indicators were found to be assessing non-intervention or ""good"" or positive outcomes more generally. Conclusions: The tools and indicators identified largely enable measurement of technical interventions and undesirable health (or pathological medical) outcomes. A physiological birth generally necessitates few, or no, interventions, yet most of the indicators presently applied fail to capture (a) this phenomenon, and (b) the relationship between different forms and processes of care, mode of birth and good or positive outcomes. A need was identified for indicators which capture non-intervention, reflecting the reality that most births are low-risk, requiring few, if any, technical medical procedures.","Tech","University of the West of England"
"The design, development and application of novel, screen-printed amperometric glutamate biosensors","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/803754/the-design-development-and-application-of-novel-screen-printed-amperometric-glutamate-biosensors","Gareth Hughes","None","The aim of the studies presented in this thesis was to develop a screen-printed electrochemical biosensor for the measurement of glutamate and to apply this device to the determination of the analyte in food, serum and toxicity studies.  Chapter 1 serves as an introduction to both the physiological significance of glutamate and the fundamental principles underpinning the electrochemical techniques used throughout this thesis.  Chapter 2 is a review chapter, separated into two main sections. The first section details glutamate biosensors fabricated with glutamate oxidase (GluOx), the second section details biosensors fabricated with glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH). The immobilization techniques, ease of fabrication and sample preparation techniques employed are compared. Biosensor characteristics such as sensitivity, limit of detection and linear range are summarised within a table.  The studies described in Chapter 3 focus on the development of a non-reagentless glutamate biosensor. A Meldola’s Blue screen-printed carbon electrode (MB-SPCE) was employed as the base transducer. The biosensor was constructed by drop coating the biopolymer chitosan (CHIT) and GLDH onto the surface of the MB-SPCE. For this study, NAD+ was present in free solution. Meldola’s Blue served as the electrocatalyst, whereby NADH produced by the GLDH/NAD+ reaction, was electrocatalytically oxidised at a low operating potential (+0.1V (vs. Ag/AgCl)). The applied potential, temperature, pH and concentration of the co-factors required for the biosensor operation were optimised in this study. The assay exhibited a linear range of 12.5 µM to 150 µM, limit of detection of 1.5 µM, response time of 2s and a sensitivity of 0.44 nA/ µM. The optimised biosensor was subsequently applied to the determination of endogenous and fortified concentrations of glutamate in both serum and food samples (OXO cubes). The serum was fortified with and the resulting mean recovery was 96% with a CV of 3.3% (n = 6). For the food sample, an unfiltered beef OXO cube was analysed for monosodium glutamate (MSG) content. The endogenous content of MSG was 125.43 mg/g, with a CV of 8.98% (n = 6). The solution was fortified with 100mM of glutamate and a resulting mean recovery of 91% with a CV of 6.39% (n = 6) was determined.  In Chapter 4, the glutamate biosensor was further developed in order to produce a reagentless device whereby the cofactor NAD+ and GLDH were immobilized on to the surface of the electrode utilising CHIT. The reagentless device was developed in order to monitor glutamate release from human liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) as a result of cell toxicity from exposure to paracetamol. The biosensor was miniaturised in the form of a microband biosensor, whereby one dimension of the electrode is of micrometre size and the other millimetre size. Micro bands exhibit unique diffusion properties in comparison to conventional sized electrodes. Calibration studies were carried out with an applied potential of +0.1V (vs. Ag/AgCl) using both phosphate buffer and cell media. In phosphate buffer the following microband biosensor characteristics were determined: linear range; 25 - 125µM, sensitivity; 0.0636 nA/µM and a theoretical limit of detection of 1.20µM. In cell media; linear range; 25 – 150 µM, sensitivity; 0.128 nA/µM and a theoretical limit of detection of 4.2µM. As the HepG2 cells were grown in an incubator at a fixed temperature and pH, studies were carried out at pH 7, 37ºC, in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The miniaturised biosensor was applied to the determination of glutamate and the quantification was done by standard addition in cell media after 24 hours exposure to various concentrations of paracetamol. The average endogenous concentrations for glutamate released from the HepG2 cells was 52.07µM (CoV: 13.74%, n = 3), 93.30µM (CoV: 18.41%, n = 3) and 177.14µM (CoV: 14.54% n = 3) for 1mM, 5mM, 10mM doses of paracetamol respectively. The microband biosensor was also applied to the real time monitoring of glutamate over 8 hours. The standard deviations for the final current generated after eight hours are as follows; 1mM (coefficient of variation (CoV): 3.3%), 5mM (CoV: 9.056%) and 10mM (CoV: 13.18%). The study showed that the magnitudes of the steady state currents increased in proportion to the concentration of added paracetamol. The study also demonstrated the possibility of applying microband biosensors, over extended time periods, for toxicity studies; there is no significant removal of analyte owning to the small biosensor dimensions.  Chapter 5 describes the development of a reagentless conventional sized glutamate biosensor whereby the cofactor NAD+ and GLDH were immobilized using a combination of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), CHIT and additional water based MB in a layer-by-layer fashion. The MWCNT/CHIT/MB combination facilitates electron transfer to the surface of working electrode. The MWCNT/CHIT also entraps GLDH and the NAD+ on the surface of the electrode. The pH, temperature, optimum applied potential, concentrations of NAD+, CHIT and the addition of water-based MB were optimised. The electrocatalyst MB allowed a operating potential of +0.1V (vs. Ag/AgCl) to be utilised. The biosensor was examined with standard glutamate solutions and the following biosensor characteristics were determined; linear range; 7 - 105µM, LOD; 3 µM, sensitivity; 0.39 nA/µM, response time 20-30s. A food sample was analysed for MSG and found to contain 90.56 mg/g with a CV of 7.52% (n = 5). The reagentless biosensor was also applied to the determination of glutamate in serum. The endogenous concentration was found to be 1.44mM (n = 5), CV: 8.54%. The recovery of glutamate in fortified serum was 104% (n = 5), CV of 2.91%. The results indicate that the new biosensor holds promise for food and biomedical studies.","Tech","University of the West of England"

It consists of a network of 43 centres from England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and aims to improve the emergency care of children through the performance of robust collaborative multicentre research within emergency departments. A study was conducted regarding the research priorities of PERUKI, to establish the research agenda for paediatric emergency medicine in the UK and Ireland. Methods: A two-stage modified Delphi survey was conducted of PERUKI members via an online survey platform. Stage 1 allowed each member to submit up to 12 individual questions that they identified as priorities for future research. In stage 2, the shortlisted questions were each rated on a seven-point Likert scale of relative importance. Participants: Members of PERUKI, including clinical specialists, academics, trainees and research nurses. Results: Stage 1 surveys were submitted by 46/91 PERUKI members (51%). A total of 249 research questions were generated and, following the removal of duplicate questions and shortlisting, 60 questions were carried forward for stage 2 ranking. Stage 2 survey responses were submitted by 58/95 members (61%). For the 60 research questions that were rated, the mean score of 'relative degree of importance' was 4.70 (range 3.36-5.62, SD 0.55). After ranking, the top 10 research priorities included questions on biomarkers for serious bacterial illness, major trauma, intravenous bronchodilators for asthma and decision rules for fever with petechiae, head injury and atraumatic limp. Conclusions: Research priorities of PERUKI members have been identified. By sharing these results with clinicians, academics and funding bodies, future research efforts can be focused to the areas of greatest need.","Tech","University of the West of England"
"Play (for) time","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/804085/play-for-time"," Patrick Crogan","Jan 26, 2015","Through their deployment of interactivity, virtualisation and simulation, videogames are prime examples of the contemporary form of what philosopher of technology, Bernard Stiegler, has termed the industrial temporal object. The experiences produced by these media are constituted in the course of the flux of the interior consciousness of the individuals engaged in following—and in the interactive era, in co-producing—the flux of their unfolding. Consequently they are at the very crux both of the individual’s own development in relation to the exterior milieu and in the mutual dynamic of individual and collective becoming that is mediated by shared experience. This paper proceeds from the conviction that a principal tendency of this crucial influence is readable in the preemptive, anticipatory temporalisation constituted in the play-time associated with mainstream videogames in their conventional, designed adoption. I offer some reflections on the challenge to individual and cultural becoming associated with this tendency toward a preemptive comportment to time. I will argue that the ludic industrial temporal object exemplifies a wider tendency toward the radical destabilization of the dynamic of individuation happening at the always technical and prosthetic nexus of the “and” between individual and collective.","Tech","University of the West of England"

One of the key barriers to their widespread use in practice is the lack of provenance data to support the reasoning and verification of experimental or analysis results. Clinical researchers use workflows to orchestrate the data present in e-science platforms in order to facilitate processing. Even though most systems capture provenance data and store it, systems rarely make use of it, thus limiting the exploitation of the true potential of such provenance. This thesis investigates mechanisms to visualise provenance data for neuroimaging analysis and to provide means to exploit the true potential of provenance data. In order to achieve this, a visualisation system has been implemented based on the use-cases that have been designed following requirements elicited for neuroimaging analysis. In this research a technique has been used to address the requirements of provenance visualisation for neuroimaging analysis. The prototype system has been tested against the provenance generated by NeuGRID for Users (N4U) as a proof of concept for our research. Different workflows have been visualised to study the efficacy of the proposed solution. Furthermore, evaluation metrics have been defined to determine whether the proposed solution is suitable for the purpose of the research conducted. The results show that the proposed visualisation system enhances the utility of provenance data for neuroimaging analysis and therefore the proposed research can be used to provide value to provenance data for neuroimaging analyses.","Tech","University of the West of England"

In order for components made from such materials to be modelled, in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for example, appropriate constitutive laws are required.  The review of the literature revealed that rubbery foams lacked the array of comprehensive data sets that have been published for near-incompressible rubbery materials for example. Moreover there were important contradictions between accounts of how rubbery foams behaved at finite strains. The review of the literature also raised some doubts on what the value of Poisson’s ratio (ν) should be for such materials in simple extension – let alone in compression.  Most finite strain FEA of rubbery foams seems to use in the constitutive law a finite strain version of ν based on logarithmic strains: here called the Poisson index, υ. Some of the implications of such approaches have been explored via theory and experiments. Some doubt has thereby been cast on such approaches.  In this project experiments performed in simple compression on a normal natural rubber latex foam have confirmed that the apparent Poisson ratio can fall to very low values even at rather small strains; the apparent Young modulus can drop to low values even at very small strains. The experiments have also indicated that: ν, and therefore υ at small strain simple extension, can be well below the value of 1/3 usually assumed; the value of υ can rise as extension progresses and can exceed ½.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Whilst we might use emerging technology, visualising techniques and different data streams to extrapolate how behaviour might change in different environments, there is long standing discourse and disagreement as to how we should understand behaviour – or indeed, what kind of behaviour should be encouraged. This is a substantial topic, with a lot of work already in place. This Commission will aim to review and identity the best of the research already published, in addition to unpublished work that has been submitted to the Chairs as part of the evidence-gathering process.  Health and Wellbeing Whilst a supportive built environment is not enough on its own to ensure physical activity, it does facilitate it. However, an unsupportive built environment is an effective deterrent of physical activity and exacerbates social exclusion (source: TRB. 2005, evidence submitted to the Inquiry). It is this complex relationship between the built environment and health measures which defines the extent to which building design for healthy living could influence policy in this area. Whilst there is ample evidence on how well designed office environments improve the productivity of its employees, buildings where people live also have a substantial impact on their physical and mental wellbeing. Post-occupancy evaluations of residential buildings are not commonly commissioned by developer clients, and even less so by depleted local authorities. Questions to Consider at this Evidence Session:  What metrics are used in the field of health and wellbeing to measure the impact of the built environment? Which of these has landed well with policymakers?  What can architects and planners do to improve the evidence base? How can they be empowered to be able to undertake post-occupancy surveys?  What is a good starting point to undertake whole systems redesign of policy responsibility for healthy buildings, as outlined in Marcella Ucci’s submission?  What is the changing role of Public Health England? Is their interest in being a commissioning partner in large planning projects seen to be a success so far?","Tech","University of the West of England"

Drawing on a single case approach, this paper examines the operational challenges faced by manufacturing SMEs as they strive to meet the expectations and requirements of increasingly demanding sustainable packaging regulations. The findings highlight the internal costs and complexities that are faced by manufacturing firms when complying with the regulations. It suggests that some firms may face financial and technical constraints that prevent them from reporting the significant efforts that they are making to improving packaging materials. More significantly it identifies the seemingly insurmountable problems that are faced by SMEs when confronted with powerful upstream or downstream supply chain partners that are resistant to improvement initiatives. This can result in organisations acting in a self-interested manner and consequently, the cumulative environmental impact of the supply chain is greater than it may be if organisations were more environmentally cooperative.","Tech","University of the West of England"

New modes of online interaction, however, require researchers to engage in constant re-evaluation of social presence theory. This study set out to investigate online mediated interaction in the voice-based chat room and the text-based forum in the context of Chinese online education. The main aims were to compare the level of social presence generated using the two technological tools, to explore how learners form an online community and to contribute to theory in this area.  A mixed-method approach was taken to investigate levels of social presence, drawing on data from 124 questionnaires, 96 postings of text messages and 3 hours and 12 minutes of voice messages collected from the text-based forum and the voice-based chat room and eight one-hour interviews with students, either individually or in pairs. The answers to the questionnaires were subjected to statistical analysis, the interactional data of both the text and voice messages were analysed using Rourke et al.’s (2001) categories and indicators of social presence while the interviews were transcribed and subjected to a more qualitative analysis.  The statistical analysis of the questionnaires showed that students tended to use text to a much greater extent than voice, probably because of technical constraints, and that students’ perceptions of social presence in the two media were not significantly different. The analysis of the interactional data revealed that the density of social presence overall was slightly higher in the voice-based chat room than in the text-based forum, but the difference between the two media was not statistically significant. However, the density scores for the interactive category were shown to be significantly higher in the voice-based than in the text-based interaction, while the opposite was the case for the cohesive category. When affective categories were compared, text and voice data were not significantly different.  As the voice-based chat room was synchronous and had the advantage of sound, students became more involved in the communication and thus a greater sense of community was created. As students developed closer relationships with each other, cohesive features could be dispensed with in the voice-based chat room, and this was why the text-based forum had a higher density of cohesive features. Voice-based interaction clearly enhances social presence and a community of learning. However, for technical reasons, it is currently recommended that students work in small groups for discussion activities and learners should have strong technical support.  From a theoretical perspective, the study underlines the need for the constant renewal of analytical tools and categories in the face of rapidly evolving interactional practice online. The multi-media resources drawn upon by students may include social media as well as university platforms and the use of emoticons, special symbols, multiple punctuation, photos and video-clips –  not to mention the use of avatars and virtual worlds, which have not been considered in the context of the current study.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Rehabilitation after stroke is of crucial importance since patients often have severe motor impairments that affect their daily activities. In the past decades, a number of robotic systems have been proposed for stroke rehabilitation but very few of them are available in the market. Addition- ally, because of their high costs they are not widely accessi- ble. This paper presents a light-weight hand exoskeleton controlled by patient's surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. This system could empower the patient to inten- sively exercise the hand and control its movement with his/her muscles. This would personalise the rehabilitation process since the system will respond to patient's own effort to move. sEMG signals were acquired from the healthy forearm and pattern recognition techniques were used to distinguish ex- tension and exion of the index and middle fingers. The mo- torized exoskeleton imposed the corresponding movements in the hand wearing it. Individualization of finger move- ments was accomplished with more than 95% of accuracy and opening and closing motions were established by the exoskeleton in the opposite hand.","Tech","University of the West of England"

This work recovers an established technique for improving quadrilateral shell element performance in both out-of-plane and in-plane bending cases using a mixed formulation. A four-field variational principle is established and we relate, at the discrete level, the Lagrange multipliers and secondary right Cauchy–Green field with the displacement and rotation fields. This is the main contribution of this work. High coarse-mesh accuracy is observed for distorted meshes and the robustness is shown to be adequate for crack propagation simulations. A consistent director normalization is performed, as an alternative to our recent spherical interpolation. Covariant metric components are deduced and exact linearization of the shell element is performed. Full assessment of the element is accomplished, showing similar performance to more costly approaches such as enhanced assumed strain. Patch test is satisfied ab-initio and benchmarks present very accurate results. Numerical experimentation for geometrically and material nonlinear problems is presented, as well as one fracture example using our recently proposed cracked edge technique.","Tech","University of the West of England"

An electronic database search was conducted via EBSCOhost, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science databases in August 2014, using Medical Subject Headings and keywords. A manual search of reference lists was also conducted. Randomised control trials which used behaviour change techniques and targeted physical activity behaviour in adults who have RA were included. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Five studies with 784 participants were included in the review. Methodological quality of the studies was mixed. The studies consisted of behaviour change interventions or combined practical physical activity and behaviour change interventions and utilised a large variety of behaviour change techniques. Four studies reported increased physical activity behaviour. All studies used subjective methods of assessing physical activity with only one study utilising an objective measure. There has been varied success of behaviour change interventions in promoting physical activity behaviour in people who have RA. Further studies are required to develop and implement the optimal behaviour change intervention in this population.","Tech","University of the West of England"

The completed app would extend the range and availability of  psychological support for student well-being at UWE and other higher education institutions.  The project team consisted of two computer scientists and one psychologist who were responsible for the technical, functional and clinical specification of the app.  A local mobile app development company was appointed and the teams collaborated on the design, build and evaluation of the app.  The self-help structure and components were developed in consultation with therapeutic practitioners, in and out of UWE.  The developer team advised on and constructed multi-media features to realise the self-help aims of the app.  The UWE project team promoted an iterative approach to development, evaluating each stage of development through trials with expert users, practitioners and students.  The app, named SAM (Self-help for Anxiety Management), was developed for Apple and Android operating systems, to be usable on smartphones and tablets.   SAM was launched in the app stores in July 2013, globally available and free to download for the first year of operation. It was promoted to students, educational institutions, mental health organisations and charities as well as a range of professional and informal contacts.    A UWE-based Advisory Board was convened to oversee the maintenance and development of the university’s investment in SAM.  Members include the project team, researchers, therapists and other staff with an interest in its use to support student well-being.   Three key tasks of the Board are to ensure SAM’s financial sustainability, to oversee developments in its usability and self-help components, and to obtain funding for the evaluation of its therapeutic impact.","Tech","University of the West of England"

In this paper we show how computer games technology can be used to address these problems. We present the PhysVis software exploration system, where software metrics can be variably mapped to parameters of a physical model and displayed via a particle system. Entities can be imbued with attributes such as mass, gravity, and (for relationships) strength or springiness, alongside traditional attributes such as position, colour and size. The resulting visualisation is a dynamic scene; the relative positions of entities are not determined by a fixed layout algorithm, but by intuitive physical notions such as gravity, mass, and drag. The implementation is openly available, and we evaluate it on a selection of visualisation tasks for two openly-available software systems.","Tech","University of the West of England"

This paper introduces a new evaluation approach to assess the effectiveness of e-learning models. This approach is derived using: (i) the ISO 25010 “Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE): System and software quality models” and (ii) the ISO 25012 “Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE): Data quality model”. Hence, the proposed evaluation approach is based on the following three main models: (i) quality in use, (ii) product quality and (iii) data quality models. In this research the proposed evaluation approach has been applied to compare and evaluate capabilities of five different e-learning models.  In addition to core qualities of ISO25010 and ISO25012 models, new qualities such as pedagogical, semantic and process-based techniques are defined to accommodate domain-specific aspects. The application of the proposed evaluation approach reveals promising results such as: (i) its ability to abstract the semantic heterogeneity between different terminologies used to describe the capabilities of different e-learning models and (ii) its holistic approach as well as its ability to be extended to assess unstructured e-learning contents. Additionally, this research identifies a list of e-learning models’ capabilities where some are common between different models e.g. interoperability and reusability; and others are specific to certain models such as processability.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Moudon published an article titled: “A Catholic Approach to Organizing What Urban Designers Should Know” where she introduced a set of categorisations that helps urban designers to organise their knowledge. After almost quarter a century, we try to update her initial article in order to find out how urban design knowledge has changed in response to the dramatic changes happening in the world. This study reflects on a broader topic of how the built environment-related knowledge and the role of universities have changed recently. In doing so, the range of literature that is being taught in more than 30 universities for urban design courses has been studied to see what is being understood as an important text, or topic. Different traditions of urban design pedagogy in US, UK and Australia have been derived by analysing these lists. A briefer enquiry has also been done to find out how urban design course coordinators see the change in urban design literature in relation to the mentioned article.  The result of this research shows that the shared body of knowledge is now relying far more on mixed method and interdisciplinary methodologies especially in more global universities. The current challenge for education system is to adapt with the rapid change in technology and enabling students to work in non-western context. The final stage of the research suggest replacing traditional urban design teaching with more critical thinking that enables student to develop their own “theory” - as it is illustrated in the post-human condition, theory should happen at the same time with practice. As a consequence, organizing the knowledge will be more like navigation through the literature that happens based on the problems in hand.","Tech","University of the West of England"

In this paper I suggest that his fictional works can and should be considered under the deeper and wider perspective of his concern for societal issues regarding science and technology with a profound consideration of their effects and on the life of people and the development of society.  In fact this defining feature of his work is inclusive of numerous works by Michael Crichton that would not fit into the techno-thriller genre. It therefore seems a more appropriate way to characterize his work. This idea is further supported by the fact that most of the few works of his that do not fit into this perspective were written during a brief period of time in which Michael Crichton explored other genres, only to return to his humanistic approach to science and technology for the rest of his fiction-writing career.","Tech","University of the West of England"

The feasibility to use dynamic soaring flight is questioned here; it requires the identification of energy-extraction mechanisms as well as accurate understanding of the way energy-harvesting performances are governed by trajectory constraints, vehicle characteristics and environment conditions. A three-dimensional energy-neutral trajectory is derived out of a specified optimization problem. Characteristic phases of flight are evidenced out of an overall closed trajectory. Simplified equations are used to evidence the physics behind energy transfers. Finally, overall energy-harvesting balance is studied through local variations of total energy along the path.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Power output limitation is one of the main concerns that need to be addressed for full-scale applications of the microbial fuel cell technology. Fouling and biofilm growth on the cathode of single chamber microbial fuel cells (SCMFC) affects their performance in long-term operation with wastewater. In this study, the authors report the power output and cathode polarization curves of a membraneless SCMFC, fed with raw primary wastewater and sodium acetate for over 6 months. At the end of the experiment, the whole cathode surface is analyzed through X-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT), scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to characterize the fouling layer and the biofilm. EDX shows the distribution of Ca, Na, K, P, S, and other elements on the two faces of the cathode. Na-carbonates and Ca-carbonates are pre-dominant on the air (outer) side and the water (inner) side, respectively. The three-dimensional reconstruction by X-ray microCT shows biofilm spots unevenly distributed above the Ca-carbonate layer on the inner (water) side of the cathode. These results indicate that carbonates layer, rather than biofilm, might lower the oxygen reduction reaction rate at the cathode duringlong-term SCMFC operation.","Tech","University of the West of England"

It also faced criticism by academia and the UK media. In March 2015, a Tribunal of the Permanent Court of Arbitration investigated the Mauritian claim. In a majority decision, the Tribunal found that Mauritius was legally disabled from pursuing its sovereignty claim but through estoppel the UK Government was required to fulfil its obligations contained in an undertaking given before independence. This included requirements for the return of the Archipelago once it is no longer needed for defence, mineral rights and historic fishing rights. It called for the proclamation to be revoked.

"Guidelines for sustainable intertidal bait and seaweed collection in Wales: Legislative review","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/806413/guidelines-for-sustainable-intertidal-bait-and-seaweed-collection-in-wales-legislative-review","Emma Bean; Dr Tom Appleby","Dec 14, 2014","The foreshore is subject to various public rights including the public right to fish in tidal waters. Ancillary to this right is the public right to collect, for personal use, bait on the foreshore and floating seaweed from the tidal waters.  The collection of bait for commercial purposes is not permitted by the public right to fish, nor can it be the subject of a customary right. The collection of fixed seaweed or seaweed deposited on the shore cannot be the subject of a customary right either. To be legal, any such activities must be permitted by an acquired legal right known as a ‘profit à prendre’, which must be established either by an express grant, or by prescription (usage over time), or by permission of the land owner. This means that the legal position of persons carrying out activities on the intertidal area may well vary from site to site, depending on the nature of the relationship between the users and the landowner.  The conservation legislation applicable in Wales comprises two main pieces of legislation; the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Habitats Directive (implemented in the UK by the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010).   The Wildlife and Countryside Act provides the mechanism to designate an area as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and then protects those areas against both occupiers of the land and third parties that may damage the flora, fauna, or features for which the area was designated. Occupiers have a higher degree of responsibility for activities which they permit on their land.  The Habitats and Birds Directives each require areas of land, foreshore and sea to be designated and managed for the conservation of particular habitats and species. In addition, the Habitats Directive places positive obligations on various public bodies to manage the designated areas so as to comply with the Habitats Directive.    Both these pieces of legislation require active management of bait collection on the foreshore. The public right to collect bait (when exercised as part of the public right to fish generally) and the public right to collect seaweed cannot be curtailed other than by the Welsh Government by Act of Parliament. It may be regulated by byelaw, but such byelaws will need to be drafted carefully and be in line with enabling legislation.  Collection activities can be regulated in a number of ways and by a number of different bodies. The most obvious being:  •	the Welsh Ministers under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 and Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967;  •	National Resources Wales under either the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 or the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981; or  •	the relevant County Council under the Public Health Acts Amendment Act 1907. Regardless of any byelaws created under any of the above legislation, any collection activities not covered by the public right also need the permission of the occupier of the land in question.   There can be no ‘one size fits all’ approach to bait digging management, as the key is to ensure that any management strategy is backed up by reliable scientific evidence specific to the area in question. The level of bait digging activity that may be acceptable for one area of foreshore cannot be extrapolated to apply to all areas of the coast.   As well as a tailored approach suiting the specific area in question, any management strategy must include (as an integral part of that strategy) a package of enforcement measures which seek to ensure that the strategy is adhered to by all users of the foreshore. A strategy which is not backed up with adequate enforcement measures is likely to fail and may expose the implementing authority to the risk of infraction proceedings under the Habitats Directive.","Marine","University of the West of England"

Tarran; Joanna L. Dixon; Rachael Beale; Dr Stephanie Sargeant","Jan 1, 2014","Acetone is an important oxygenated volatile organic compound (OVOC) in the troposphere where it influences the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. However, the air-sea flux is not well quantified, in part due to a lack of knowledge regarding which processes control oceanic concentrations, and, specifically whether microbial oxidation to CO2 represents a significant loss process. We demonstrate that 14C labeled acetone can be used to determine microbial oxidation to 14CO2. Linear microbial rates of acetone oxidation to CO2 were observed for between 0.75-3.5 h at a seasonally eutrophic coastal station located in the western English Channel (L4). A kinetic experiment in summer at station L4 gave a Vmax of 4.1 pmol L-1 h-1, with a Km constant of 54 pM. We then used this technique to obtain microbial acetone loss rates ranging between 1.2 and 42 pmol L-1 h-1.(monthly averages) over an annual cycle at L4, with maximum rates observed during winter months. The biological turnover time of acetone (in situ concentration divided by microbial oxidation rate) in surface waters varied from ~3 days in February 2011, when in situ concentrations were 3 ± 1 nM, to >240 days in June 2011, when concentrations were more than twofold higher at 7.5 ± 0.7 nM. These relatively low marine microbial acetone oxidation rates, when normalized to in situ concentrations, suggest that marine microbes preferentially utilize other OVOCs such as methanol and acetaldehyde. © 2014 Dixon, Beale, Sargeant, Tarran and Nightingale.","Marine","University of the West of England"
"Maximum sustainable yield?

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) grants coastal states sovereign rights to fish to the edge of their ‘exclusive economic zone’ (usually a 200 mile limit).  Those rights are qualified to the coastal state having a duty to maintain or restore fish stocks to maximum sustainable yield (MSY). MSY is not defined in UNCLOS but has been interpreted to relate to a stock by stock assessment rather than a view of the health of the ecosystem as a whole.  Despite UNCLOS many coastal states fish well beyond MSY and even the reformed European Union’s Common Fisheries Policy only commits the EU to reach MSY for its stocks by 2020. Unsurprisingly fish stocks have been decimated, though the bones of reform are in place.  The Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Health and Safety at Work) Regulations 1997 give the basis for health and safety at sea, yet there would appear to still be problems.  A 2008 report by Swansea University concluded an unacceptably high mortality rate among UK fishers.  This has been compounded by recent reports in the UK press of the use of illegal immigrants and even ‘slaves’ on vessels in UK waters.  In the UK the right to fish is held on trust for the public, yet unlike in the management of most public property there is no clear plan to get the most public benefit from the UK fishery.  There is valuable opportunity from implementing the existing regulations to benefit the health of fish, fishers and people, simply by posing the question: ‘what do we want from our oceans?’","Marine","University of the West of England"

Despite this, up until 2012, there was no strategic approach across the UK to regulate potentially damaging fishing in sites, regardless of case law, or the implications of damage from certain fishing gears (e.g. bottom trawls and scallop dredgers). The UK Government has recently revised its approach to how it implements Article 6 of the Habitats Directive with respect to fisheries in England which has led to a new scientific risk-based approach to managing potentially damaging fishing activities. delivery of management has involved regulators, NGOs, government offices, statutory nature conservation agencies and fishing interests collaboratively populating a scientifically populated \'risk matrix\'. Regulators are now managing sites pro-actively by bringing into force local by-laws and permitting arrangements that restrict potentially damaging fishing. The work shows the ability for a number of different stakeholders to engage with improving the implementation of a law which is now over 20 years old, but which has generally been poorly implemented in the marine environment. It is an example of progressive protection that makes the marine Natura 2000 network more effective in achieving its conservation goals.","Marine","University of the West of England"
"Holocene sea-level change at the Steart Peninsula, Somerset: Development and application of a multi-proxy sea-level transfer function for the Severn Estuary region","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/828640/holocene-sea-level-change-at-the-steart-peninsula-somerset-development-and-application-of-a-multi-proxy-sea-level-transfer-function-for-the-severn-estuary-region","Elizabeth Elliott","None","This thesis presents a multi-proxy reconstruction of Holocene sea-level change at the Steart Peninsula in Bridgwater Bay, Somerset. Single- and multi-proxy transfer functions were developed from diatom and foraminifera training data from two sites on the Severn Estuary coast. Constrained and partial constrained ordination estimated that 5.5% of the intertidal diatom variation and 11.4% of the intertidal foraminifera variation in the training sets was explained independently by elevation within the tidal frame. Foraminifera provided more favourable transfer function prediction statistics but were low in abundance in parts of the intertidal zone, resulting in a smaller than optimal training set. The preferred transfer function combined diatom and foraminifera data to optimise prediction statistics and intertidal coverage. An 11.22m fossil core was retrieved from the Steart Peninsula for stratigraphic and micropalaeontological analyses. Analogue matching revealed that combining the two proxies increased the number of fossil samples with good or fair modern analogues in relation to the single proxies separately. The preferred multi-proxy transfer function was applied to the fossil micropalaeontological data. The sediment stratigraphy, biostratigraphy and transfer function-based estimates indicated an overall rise in relative sea-level of about 13m between 7,582-7,345 and 1,804-1,690 cal. years before present (cal. yr BP), beginning with an initial rapid phase of sea-level rise and silty clay deposition in a minerogenic saltmarsh environment. Between 6,188-6,007 and 3,942-3,759 cal. years BP three main fluctuations in marine influence occurred, allowing organic upper saltmarsh conditions to develop periodically, but the data scatter and large vertical error bars prevent a detailed interpretation of absolute sea-level change. Diatoms and foraminifera were sparse or absent between 4,053-3,869 and 1,927-1,806 cal. years BP. Finally, foraminifera assemblages indicated a possible tidal flat environment and increase in marine influence between 1,927-1,806 and 1,682-1,619 cal. years BP. This research concludes that multi-proxy methods have the potential to improve the accuracy and precision of relative sea-level reconstruction in an extremely macrotidal setting such as that of the Severn Estuary, but that a number of issues such as sediment autocompaction and possible Holocene tidal range changes need to be quantified in order for the broad sea-level history presented to be constrained further.","Marine","University of the West of England"

There is no area where this complexity is more demonstrable than in the marine environment, where the issues of extended maritime boundaries granted under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, fishing and prospecting rights, marine conservation and competing sovereignty mean that the practical application of the law in this area is particularly difficult to interpret. This complex environment makes it challenging to undertake conservation activities.

The research appraised and analysed marine fishing rights, the ownership of the UK marine fishery and the establishment of marine protected areas both under UK and aspects of EU law. The research adopted a doctrinal method triangulated via professional examples adopting aspects of action research.  The scientific research, on which this research drew, established that there is a serious decline in UK fisheries and an urgent need to bring in measures to safeguard the fishery.  The research found significant failings in the common law public right to fish, which designated the UK’s entire marine area as a fishery without apparent reasonable limitations as to use.  It found that the absence of a stated public owner of the fishery with clear public duties makes it difficult to secure the public interest.   It also highlighted the absence of clarity in the creation of derivative rights in the public fishery such as fishing quota, estimated in 1999 to be worth £1 billion. The research demonstrates the significant shortfall in the number of statutory marine protected areas created under the Marine Acts and raises concerns that these statutory measures could lead to paper parks with no active management measures. It shows the effectiveness of the application of the Habitats Directive to protect European marine sites and concludes that other European legislation could similarly be used to protect the marine environment from fisheries.    It also found a lack of a coherent narrative relating to the mechanics and powers and duties of UK fisheries managers and concluded that there should be more comprehensive guidance on UK fisheries law, as the last comprehensive fishery texts date from the nineteenth century.   The research recommends new Fisheries Acts to remedy some of the apparent defects in UK fisheries law.","Marine","University of the West of England"

Since taking over direct responsibility for the Welsh marine environment, the Welsh Government has failed to integrate fisheries management and marine conservation as effectively as has been achieved by relevant English authorities, particularly Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities (IFCAs). A key contributing factor to this failure is that, whilst MCAA created a clear statutory framework for England's IFCAs, Welsh Government resisted the imposition of similar management duties for Wales, and, subsequently, the National Assembly for Wales has not used its legislative powers to create a suitably robust Welsh regime. Furthermore, the suspension in 2016 of the stakeholder ‘Inshore Fisheries Groups’ has partly dismantled the relatively weak co-management regime in Wales. Although the Welsh Marine Fisheries Advisory Group remains, its scope has been much reduced. Post MCAA, the Welsh system has centralised decision making, creating a more remote and less responsive management structure than had existed previously.","Marine","University of the West of England"

The use of high strength-to-weight ratio-laminated fiber-reinforced composites is emerging in engineering sectors such as aerospace, marine and automotive to improve productivity. Nevertheless, delamination between the layers is a limiting factor for the wider application of laminated composites, as it reduces the stiffness and strengths of the structure. Previous studies have proven that ply interface nanofibrous fiber reinforcement has an effective influence on delamination resistance of laminated composite materials. This paper aims to investigate the effect of nanofiber ply interface reinforcement on mode I properties and failure responses when being subjected to static and fatigue loadings. For this purpose, virgin and nanomodified woven laminates were subjected to Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) experiments. Static and fatigue tests were performed in accordance with standards and the Acoustic Emissions (AE) were acquired during these tests. The results showed not only a 130% increase of delamination toughness for nanomodified specimens in the case of static loads, but also a relevant crack growth resistance in the case of fatigue loads. In addition, the AE permitted to relate these improvements to the different failure mechanisms occurring.","Marine","University of the West of England"

"Provenance of lower cretaceous quartz arenites from the northern Indian Plate: Tropical weathering or a multi-cycled sediment source?","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/855809/provenance-of-lower-cretaceous-quartz-arenites-from-the-northern-indian-plate-tropical-weathering-or-a-multi-cycled-sediment-source"," Hazel Beaumont; Stuart Burley; Thomas Gould; Stuart Clarke","Dec 18, 2018","Introduction. Lower Cretaceous sediments of the northwestern Indian Plate margin were deposited in the Barmer, Cambay, Narmada, Kachchh and Jaisalmer basins (Figure 1) of the West Indian Rift System (WIRS) and the Lower and Middle Indus Basins (LMIB; Figure 1). These fluvial and coastal plain sediments are dominated by mature quartz arenites (Baig et al., 2016). Such an extreme quartz-rich detrital mineralogy is surprising, given that the local highs flanking the WIRS comprise a variety of Precambrian basement rocks including the Malani Igneous Suite, the Delhi Supergroup, the Aravalli Mobile Belt, the Bundelkhand Craton and the Cambrian sediments of the Marwar Supergroup (Figure 2). Most published studies assume that the main source area for these quartz arenites is the Aravalli Mobile Belt, although there is little palaeogeographical or mineralogical evidence to support this. Presented here are new mineralogical data for the fluvial Ghaggar-Hakra Formation (Figure 3) of the Barmer Basin and a compilation of published detrital mineralogies of sandstones across the WIRS and LMIB, which are laterally equivalent to the Ghaggar-Hakra Formation. The aim here is to constrain the main provenance source areas during the Lower Cretaceous. Petrography. For the Ghaggar-Hakra Formation 99 thin sections (Figure 4) from both outcrop and core were point-counted. Virtually all the samples are quartz arenites or sublithic arenites with almost no detrital feldspar (see Figures 4 and 5). Published data for the WIRS indicates that the sandstones are predominantly quartz arenites or sub-lithic arenites (Figure 5), apart from in the Kachchh Basin which has an arkosic detrital composition (Figure 5). The LMIB sandstones are mineralogically classified as sub-lithic arenites (Figure 5).  Determining the Pre-diagenesis mineralogy. Studies indicate that these sediments have been affected by diagenesis (Baig et al., 2016; Bose et al., 1986; Desai and Desai, 1989; Racey at el., 2016; Zaighama and Mallick, 2000). To understand the source provenance it is necessary to reconstruct the original detrital mineralogy by: •	Adding oversized pores, grain-replacive calcite cement and authigenic kaolinite together to recalculate the original feldspar content, and;  •	Adding authigenic chlorite, smectite, opaque minerals and iron-replaced grains to the lithic total. These calculations indicate that the sandstones from the Barmer, Cambay, Narmada and Jaisalmer basins remain within the quartz arenite and sub-lithic arenite mineralogical ranges (Figure 6). The sandstones in the Kachchh Basin (Figure 6) are distinctly arkosic and the LMIB are within both the lithic arkose and feldspathic arenite mineralogical ranges (Figure 6). Discussion.  Major differences in the detrital mineralogy of Lower Cretaceous sandstones across the northern Indian Plate indicate that the widespread development of quartz arenites cannot be the result of deep tropical weathering, as previously reported. Rather, the mineralogical differences reflect variation in the source provenance. Using well established sandstone provenance triangular plots, the Lower Cretaceous sandstones within the WIRS and LMIB appear to be comprised of recycled quartzose, dissected arc and transitional continental mineralogical ranges. A detailed Lower Cretaceous palaeographical reconstruction of the northern Indian Plate margin inconjunction with the recalculated QFL mineralogical diagrams (Figure 1 and 7) suggests the Lower Cretaceous sediments of the Kachchh and LMIB are likely to be derived from local Saurashtra and Nagar-Parkar, highs whilst the sandstones of the Narmada, Cambay, Barmer and Jaisalmer basins are likely to be derived from the Marwar Supergroup and the lower reaches of the Aravalli Mobile Belt as the quartz here is second generation and has likely travelled long distances. The loss of feldspar within the sandstones is considered to be due to in-situ diagenesis and transportation of the sediments from the Marwar Supergroup and from the local highs (Figures 1, 2 and 7).    Figure captions: Figure 1: Palaeogeographical reconstruction of the Lower Cretaceous rifts and associated depositional systems on the northwestern Indian Plate. Distribution of the dominant alluvial facies, passing into fluvial sedimentation and then coastal plains, is based on Walther’s Law constrained by the widely spaced outcrops. The Indo-Tethys Ocean coastline is depicted by coastal sedimentation within the Indus, Jaisalmer, Miajilar, Rahn, Banni and Kachchh basins; these coastal sediments pass into shallow marine and deep marine sediments in present day Pakistan. The rivers feeding these basins and coastal sediments are sourced from the highs flankig the rift systems and the Aravalli Mountain Range. Palaeocurrents are predominantly from the south and southwest to the north and northeast, although extensively modified by rift basin geometry as in the case of the Barmer Basin. This palaeographical reconstruction (from Beaumont et al., 2018) is derived from multiple sources: Ahmad et al. (2012); Akhtar & Ahmed (1991); Aslam (1992); Bhatt et al.

Ships are usually under vibration, impact, and other kinds of static and dynamic loads. These loads arise from water flow across the hull or surfaces, the propeller cavitation, and so on. For optimal design purposes and reliable performance, experimental measurements are necessary. These sensors are often used under or near the water, working conditions that improve the risk of sensor damage. This paper aims at investigating, by the use of finite elements, the behavior of damaged piezoelectric sensors under traction and impact loads. The numerical method was calibrated using results available in the literature regarding piezoelectric and elastic plates with a central crack. After calibration, the simulation was used on two types of Lead-Zirconium-Titanium oxide (PZT) sandwich panel structures reinforced by aluminum skins. The results proved that the damage size and impact energy are important factors affecting the response of piezoelectric sensors; therefore, special attention might be considered when using these sensors for marine applications.","Marine","University of the West of England"

Methanol is a climate-active gas and the most abundant oxygenated volatile organic compound (OVOC) in the atmosphere and seawater. Marine methylotrophs are aerobic bacteria that utilise methanol from seawater as a source of carbon (assimilation) and/or energy (dissimilation). A few spatially limited studies have previously reported methanol oxidation rates in seawater; however, the basin-wide ubiquity of marine microbial methanol utilisation remains unknown. This study uniquely combines seawater 14C labelled methanol tracer studies with 16S rRNA pyrosequencing to investigate variability in microbial methanol dissimilation and known methanol-utilising bacteria throughout a meridional transect of the Atlantic Ocean between 47° N to 39° S. Microbial methanol dissimilation varied between 0.05 and 1.68nmolL-1h-1 in the top 200m of the Atlantic Ocean and showed significant variability between biogeochemical provinces. The highest rates of methanol dissimilation were found in the northern subtropical gyre (average 0.99±0.41nmolL-1h-1), which were up to 8 times greater than other Atlantic regions. Microbial methanol dissimilation rates displayed a significant inverse correlation with heterotrophic bacterial production (determined using 3H-leucine). Despite significant depth stratification of bacterial communities, methanol dissimilation rates showed much greater variability between oceanic provinces compared to depth. There were no significant differences in rates between samples collected under light and dark environmental conditions. The variability in the numbers of SAR11 (16S rRNA gene sequences) were estimated to explain approximately 50% of the changes in microbial methanol dissimilation rates.

This paper uses an interdisciplinary team to investigate the use of remote sensing technologies to provide sufficient evidence for effective fisheries management. It uses the intended marine protected area around Ascension Island as a case study. Satellite technology provides opportunities to detect the presence of fishing vessels but because of difficulties with data interpretation, it is unlikely to be a sole source of evidence for prosecutions. Developing drone technology and traditional over-flights by aerial surveillance may supplement satellite technology with 'eyewitness’ evidence. Well-crafted regulations will be able to make some use of this data, but the evidential requirements of criminal courts make prosecutions difficult to pursue. There is some scope to expand management opportunities through vesting the fishery in a public body and pursuing offenders through civil law, this approach having a different suite of remedies.  Other opportunities lie in giving very large marine protected areas legal personality which has similar advantages and additional reputational benefits. Using remote sensing data in the civil court poses evidential problems. An alternative approach is to collate data around frequent infringers and, by negatively impacting on their reputation, restrict their ability to obtain insurance, finance, access to fisheries and market access. This is exemplified in port state measures by fisheries authorities and chain of custody requirements by labeling bodies. Data sharing raises challenges with intellectual property and coordination.

This project introduces a novel piezoelectric based sensor as a load spectrum counter that can measure the complex loading conditions over the structure's lifetime. The sensor has been designed using piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) combined with a custom electronic circuit, which counts the number of times the load in a structure surpasses pre-selected amount. Any force applied to the piezoelectric PVDF sensor generates an electrostatic output voltage due to the separation of charges in the atomic structure of the piezoelectric. The output from the piezoelectric PVDF (PE-PVDF) is a pulse wave with an amplitude proportional to the load input and an amplifier connected to the level detector used to enhance the pulse. When the amplitude of the data pulse exceeds a certain level, a signal emitted by the level detector activates the counter and stores the data. To prevent counting of noise an adjustable dead zone is added at each level detector. Therefore, after the load surpasses a specified level and a count is registered, no action occurs (i.e. the output is zero) and the load must drop under the dead zone and then rise again before another count is registered. The concept is validated experimentally both on an aluminium and epoxy/SE70 glass composites yielding load-spectra. The sensor is calibrated for different materials and geometrical conditions need to be investigated. The vision of the project is to make wireless and embedded fatigue counter sensors designed for real industrial applications.","Marine","University of the West of England"

Bridgeville contracts with private-sector firms in providing market-focused prison-work – so-called real work – for inmates in some of its workshops. In exploring prisoners’ perceptions of this privatised prison-work, it is found that it mainly comprises mundane, low-skilled activities typical of informalised, poor-quality jobs that are socially, legally and economically devalued and categorised as forms of ‘invisible work’. At Bridgeville, such privatised prison-work largely fails in engaging or upskilling inmates, leaving them pessimistic about its value as preparation for employment post-release.

Through a critically reflective narrative account and two case studies, which represent the perspectives of all involved, this article considers the processes of engagement, their effectiveness, the outcomes delivered and recommendations, as well as the context and influence of European policy – represented by the 'business assist' (BA) model – on creating engaged research. The co-creation of mutually beneficial space emerged as a key success factor, which challenged the short-term focus of the BA model.","Marine","University of the West of England"

Russel; Roos M. den Uyl; Dr Laura De Vito","Apr 1, 2018","© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Integration of relatively new policy tasks like climate adaptation into established higher-level policy fields is insufficiently understood in the academic literature. This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the integration of climate adaptation into the sectoral policy-making of the European Commission, particularly following the publication of the EU Adaptation Strategy (in 2013). The paper uses a framework of micro, meso and macro-level institutional behaviour drawing strongly on new institutionalism perspectives to identify and explain factors enabling and hindering policy integration. It focuses on integration in the coastal and marine policy sector, which is expected to be particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts, and draws from data collected through a document review and interviews with key informants. The findings show that the integration of climate adaptation is still at an early stage. The integration process appears to be largely dependent on institutional dynamics at the EU-level combined with how member states and wider sectoral stakeholders engage with adaptation concerns. In particular, the ambivalence of some member states and a lack of urgency among sectoral stakeholders has hampered the integration of adaptation goals.","Marine","University of the West of England"

Sustainability science suggests a core set of factors that foster significant change in governance, with leaders and entrepreneurs often identified as the main instigators.

We present an empirical study that uses a participatory network mapping approach to provide a broader examination of leadership in integrated conservation and development. We use the Coral Triangle Initiative in Solomon Islands as an example of potential transformation in environmental governance across multiple objectives. Our analysis shows that actants, other than key individuals, enact leadership. We illustrate that a different suite of actants are providing leadership for each of the three Coral Triangle Initiative objectives. Actants can enact leadership by positively and negatively influencing different goals to varying extents. Our study illustrates the potential of broader and more nuanced understandings of leadership in environmental governance.","Marine","University of the West of England"

The UK Government had developed no plan  in the event of a “leave” vote for June’s advisory referendum and the months since the vote have been mired in politics and process as the Government and political parties attempt to formulate a strategy both within the UK and externally. The politics is beyond the scope of this article, but the legal process is of fundamental importance and will set the parameters for any political settlement. Nothing exemplifies this better than the case of R (ex parte Miller and another) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.  The Government had planned on using prerogative powers to trigger article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon in order to start the process of negotiating withdrawal from the EU, but the Supreme Court ruled that the prerogative does not extend to acts that result in a change to domestic UK law and that there was no statutory authority to trigger article 50, so enabling legislation will be required.  At the same time, the Court acknowledged that arrangements for consultations between the devolved institutions and the UK institutions were of a political character and therefore the Scottish Parliament will not have a legal right to be consulted on future changes to the legal framework in the UK, let alone a veto on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.  As we roll into the 'Great Repeal Bill' process, this delicate dance between the executive, the courts, Parliament and the devolved administrations is likely to be a constant.","Marine","University of the West of England"

In 2015, policy-makers withdrew three of four proposed Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) in the Irish Sea from consideration for designation, due to concerns that they could significantly impact on the fisheries sector in Northern Ireland because they overlap with prawn fishing grounds in the Irish Sea. Although research has quantified the potential impact upon fishing vessels, none has quantified the impact upon the fisheries sector nor assessed the significance of this impact. Arguably, MCZ designations (or lack thereof) based on the ‘significance’ of an impact require robust underpinning evidence. This paper reports the findings of an Economic Impact Assessment, which has quantified the impact of a decline in landings upon the Northern Ireland fisheries sector and regional economy (data which is currently absent from the evidence base for the MCZ designation process in England). It finds that this will incur job losses in three fishing ports in Northern Ireland, but is unlikely to have a significant impact upon Northern Ireland's fisheries sector and regional economy in terms of jobs and Gross Value Added (GVA). In the worst case, the resulting economic impact is a decrease of £1.05–1.12 m/year GVA in Northern Ireland, which is 1.1% of the contribution of fishing and fish processing to the regional economy. Economic significance assessments, using this methodology, may be useful in supporting the evidence base underpinning MCZ designation and other aspects of marine planning.","Marine","University of the West of England"

Itsmain aim was to organize outdoor robotics competitions in realistic search and rescue response scenarios for cooperative land, sea, and air robots. Participant teams were requested to test the intelligence and autonomy of their robots in scenarios inspired by the 2011 Fukushima accident. In the project’s third year euRathlon culminated with the organization of the first outdoor multi-domain search and rescue robotics competition in the world: the euRathlon 2015 Grand Challenge. Sea, air, and land robots were asked to cooperate acting as a robotic intervention team in a scenario simulating an industrial area ravaged by a tsunami. The Grand Challenge was held in Piombino, Italy, in the surroundings of the Tor del Sale power plant, from September 17 to 25. To prepare the teams for the Grand Challenge, two competitions, dedicated to land and marine robots, respectively, took place in 2013 and 2014. In all the competitions, a strong effort was made in benchmarking what led tomeaningful and reasonable scoring principles.Workshops and educational activities complemented the competitions. In this paper, we will focus on the marine robotics competitions of euRathlon with a particular focus on the Grand Challenge. Both technical achievements and general results are presented. The results in terms of team participation and the fruitful effort in dissemination led to establish euRathlon Grand Challenge as the de facto leading search and rescue outdoor robotics competition in Europe.","Marine","University of the West of England"

This review uses a multidisciplinary approach to investigate legal issues concerning the oceans and human health. It firstly seeks to define the boundaries of oceans and human health research. We use three case studies as examples: biomedical research, marine litter and human well-being. Biomedical research raises complex issues relating to coastal states' sovereign rights to exploit their marine resources and the patenting processes. Coastal states have differing degrees of control over research at sea. There are differences in EU and US law over the status of genetic discoveries, with the US having stricter criteria to qualify for patent protection. International law sets the standard for bioprospecting in developing countries under the Nagoya Protocol. The cost and complexity of marine biomedical research mean that it cannot be left to commercial exploration and needs some public funding. The second case study highlights the rise in marine plastics pollution using Marine Conservation Society beachwatch data. It details the need to alter product design to avoid marine pollution and records an unsuccessful attempt by academics and an NGO to make contact with the manufacturers of one polluting product. It also introduces the concept that faulty design could amount to a public nuisance. The third case study highlights the potential health benefits from access to the coast and the statutory responsibility which sits with the US and UK authorities in the provision of well-being. It posits that there needs to be greater inter-agency coordination to promote access to the coast for human well-being.","Marine","University of the West of England"

The Piedras River marshland and El Rompido spit bar is a Natural Site in close proximity to two of the most polluted rivers in the world: the Tinto and Odiel Rivers. The aim of this study is to determine the degree of contamination of this Natural Site using a variety of pollution indices. At this site the Holocene infilling sequence is recorded and applied to a study of the pollution history and the possible impacts of human activity. The depositional history of the Piedras River estuary during the Holocene recorded open marine conditions at ca. 6500 calBP when sea-level was at its Holocene maximum. To study the pollution of the estuary during the Holocene, catchment background geochemistry was established using samples that pre-date human activity (agriculture and mining). Additionally, the sedimentary environment was reconstructed throughout the Holocene; comparison of pollution levels is interpreted to be more reliable if the sedimentary environment has remained similar throughout the depositional record. Results show that, despite being located nearby very polluted estuaries, the Piedras River marshland contains unpolluted sediments mainly because of the small catchment area relative to that of neighbouring more polluted rivers, and thus has not been affected by human activity such as mining.","Marine","University of the West of England"

Hardwick; Antonella M. Colucci; Lars Johanning","Mar 1, 2016","© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. This study explores typical characteristics of the mean and turbulent profiles at a mixed low tidal energy site (40 m mean water depth) where the waves have limited effects on the currents. The turbulence profiles were derived from secondary current data using a 5-beam ADCP which was optimised for wave measurements. The tidal currents have peak flows of ~1 m/s during spring tide. The turbulence intensity is no less than 10% at peak flows and compares well with values at other tidal channels (at ~5 m from seabed). The Reynolds stresses show symmetry at the neap tide but less so for the spring tide. Although the qualitative profiles of TKE are similar between the neap and spring tides, the values of TKE for flood flow are the largest throughout the deployment. The integral length scales are in good agreement with theory, and with estimates based on the mixing length concept. The measured turbulence parameters are sensitive to flow inhomogeneity, Doppler noise, and ADCP tilt. The findings demonstrate the practical benefits of exploiting secondary current data at a mixed low tidal energy site for estimating typical turbulence characteristics; such information can be used to define design standards and protocols for marine energy devices.","Marine","University of the West of England"
"The UK scallop fishery: Time for a fundamental review","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/916473/the-uk-scallop-fishery-time-for-a-fundamental-review","Dr Tom Appleby","Jan 1, 2016","The global fishing industry is facing unprecedented pressures.  In the past (for a variety of reasons) the entire ocean was designated as a fishery using any gear type but increasingly this approach is untenable.  The seas and the fishery (albeit through some strange legal mechanisms) belong to the public who are making a greater range of demands on their public resource than just fishery and navigation; marine conservation, oil exploration, windfarms and commercial dredging are all making a more complex environment for fishers to operate within and are causing increased scrutiny on the basic operational parameters of the fishing industry.  For a variety of legal reasons ranging from marine protected area designations to the rights of the seabed owners it is no longer possible to use any gear type in any area without consideration of the ramifications on other users. Former legal loopholes relating to everything from health and safety to slavery are rapidly being closed in relation to fisheries as the ability to enforce against vessels at sea increases and legal norms are incorporated from elsewhere. Perhaps no fishery exemplifies the tensions generated by the former freedoms of the sea as much as the scallop fishery.  The increasing use of subsea cabling, the establishment of marine protected areas and a larger array of zonal fisheries management measures have all brought scallop dredging into conflict with other marine users as well as increasing focus on gear conflict within the industry particularly those engaged in static fisheries. The introduction of effort controls for over 15 meter vessels via days at sea restrictions in 2015 and other technical measures are the first attempts to directly control the fishery but there is still a long way to go before the public endorsed uses of the sea (and the seabed) are properly protected from perceived wide rights granted to scallop dredgers.   It is time to reverse this approach and identify where scallop dredging should take place and control it that way rather than having dredging as a default fishery.  Such an approach is the norm in other areas of land management.","Marine","University of the West of England"

The free allocation of quota to commercial businesses on the basis of 2 years’ track record is a similar process to permitting that public asset to be squatted.  The complex and badly drafted regulation which underpins this process has permitted a great deal of uncertainty in the allocation of fishing quota and the opaque mechanisms for the allocation of quota are likely to lead to concentration of quota among a few fishing businesses. This is largely responsibility of the UK authorities rather than European Union.  It will need primary legislation to resolve this issue and establish a proper transparent system according to the practices conducted almost universally elsewhere in government when disposing of public assets to the private sector.","Marine","University of the West of England"

Social behaviour may enable organisms to occupy ecological niches that would otherwise be unavailable to them. Here, we test this major evolutionary prin- ciple by demonstrating self-organizing social behaviour in the plant-animal, Symsagittifera roscoffensis. These marine aceol flat worms rely for all of their nutrition on the algae within their bodies: hence their common name. We show that individual worms interact with one another to coordinate their movements so that even at low densities they begin to swim in small polarized groups and at increasing densities such flotillas turn into circular mills. We use computer simulations to: (i) determine if real worms interact socially by com- paring them with virtual worms that do not interact and (ii) show that the social phase transitions of the real worms can occur based only on local inter- actions between and among them. We hypothesize that such social behaviour helps the worms to form the dense biofilms or mats observed on certain sun- exposed sandy beaches in the upper intertidal of the East Atlantic and to become in effect a super-organismic seaweed in a habitat where macro-algal seaweeds cannot anchor themselves. Symsagittifera roscoffensis, a model organ- ism in many other areas in biology (including stem cell regeneration), also seems to be an ideal model for understanding how individual behaviours can lead, through collective movement, to social assemblages.","Marine","University of the West of England"

The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (SDA75) , now replaced by the Equality Act 2010 , excludes discriminatory acts from protection to ensure combat effectiveness. This must comply with relevant EU legislation  that does not contain a provision allowing an exclusion for combat effectiveness although the ECJ has held that the Member States may take decisions on the organisation of their armed forces to ensure their security . However, this has to be exercised with the genuine aim of guaranteeing public security whilst being appropriate and necessary to achieve this aim  with a ban on women serving in the Royal Marines justified as it would be confined to a small force and applied to the principle of inter-operability. This combat effectiveness exclusion limits full integration of women in the military ensuring that women cannot serve in front line army units, the RAF Regiment, the Royal Marines and submarines . In a new report in November 2010 exclusion of women from ground close-combat roles was retained  and wholly attributed to unit cohesion. In December 2011, it was announced that the submarine service would be fully opened to women by 2016.  This paper will consider the retention of the combat effectiveness exclusion and analyse its legality especially with reference to EU and UK law.","Navy","University of the West of England"

The overall aim of this study is to develop a Building Information Modelling based Deconstructability Assessment Score (BIM-DAS) for determining the extent to which a building could be deconstructed right from the design stage. To achieve this, a review of extant literature was carried out to identify critical design principles influencing effectual building deconstruction and key features for assessing the performance of Design for Deconstruction (DfD). Thereafter, these key features were used to develop BIM-DAS using mathematical modelling approach based on efficient material requirement planning. BIM-DAS was later tested using case study design and the results show that the major contributing factors to DfD are use of prefabricated assemblies and demountable connections. The results of the evaluation demonstrate the practicality of BIM-DAS as an indicator to measure the deconstructability of building designs. This could provide a design requirement benchmark for effective building deconstruction.

Introduction: The relationship between mental health symptoms, stigmatising beliefs about mental health and help seeking is complex and poorly understood. Method: 1636 UK Armed Forces personnel provided study data immediately after deployment (T1) and approximately 6months later (T2). Stigmatising beliefs were assessed using an eight-item scale previously used in studies of UK military personnel. Symptoms of probable common mental disorder, probable post-traumatic stress disorder and subjective stressful, emotional, relationship and family problems were evaluated at T1 and T2. Help seeking during deployment was assessed at T1 and post-deployment help seeking at T2. Alcohol use and subjective alcohol problems were assessed at T2 only. Results: Reporting a probable mental health disorder or potentially harmful alcohol use following deployment was both significantly associated with higher levels of stigmatising beliefs. The reported degree of stigma was associated with changes in mental health symptom levels; compared to those who were never classified as a probable mental health disorder case, recovered cases experienced significantly lower levels of stigmatisation, whereas new onset cases reported significantly higher levels. Conclusion: The way that individuals report mental health stigmatisation is not static; rather stigma fluctuates in proportion to the frequency and severity of psychological symptoms. These results suggest that public health stigma-reduction strategies which aim to promote engagement with mental health services should be focused towards people who are experiencing worsening mental health. Our results suggest that willing volunteers who have recovered from a mental-ill-health episode may be well placed to assist in the delivery of such a strategy.","Ai","University of the West of England"

Owing to its contribution of largest portion of landfill wastes and consumption of about half of mineral resources excavated from nature, construction industry has been pressed to improve its sustainability. Despite an adoption of several waste management strategies, and introduction of various legislative measures, reducing waste generated by the industry remains challenging. In order to understand cultural factors contributing to waste intensiveness of the industry, as well as those preventing effectiveness of existing waste management strategies, this study examines cultural profile of construction industry. Drawing on four focus group discussions with industry experts, the study employs phenomenological approach to explore waste inducing cultural factors. Combining findings from phenomenological research with extant literatures, the study suggests that in order to reduce waste intensiveness of the construction industry, five waste inducing cultural factors need to be changed. These include (i) ""make-do"" understanding that usually result in ""make-do waste"" (ii) non-collaborative culture, which results in reworks and other forms of wasteful activities (iii) blame culture, which encourages shifting of waste preventive responsibilities between designers and contractors, (iv) culture of waste behaviour, which encourages belief in waste inevitability, and (v) conservatism, which hinders diffusion of innovation across the industry. Changing these sets of cultural and behavioural activities is not only important for engendering waste management practices; they are requisite for effectiveness of existing strategies. Improvement in the identified areas is also required for overall improvement and general resource efficiency of the construction industry. Thus, this paper advocates cultural shift as a means of reducing waste landfilled by the construction industry, thereby enhancing sustainability and profitability of the industry.","Ai","University of the West of England"

This study identifies evaluation criteria with the goal of appraising the performance of existing construction waste management tools and employing the results in the development of a holistic building information modelling (BIM) framework for construction waste management. Based on the literature, this paper identifies 32 construction waste management tools in five categories: (a) waste management plan templates and guides, (b) waste data collection and audit tools (c) waste quantification models, (d) waste prediction tools, and (e) geographic information system (GIS)-enabled waste tools. After reviewing these tools and conducting four focus-group interviews (FGIs), the findings revealed six categories of evaluation criteria (a) waste prediction; (b) waste data; (c) commercial and procurement; (d) BIM; (e) design; and (f) technological. The performance of the tools is assessed using the evaluation criteria and the result reveals that the existing tools are not robust enough to tackle construction waste management at the design stage. The paper therefore discusses the development of a holistic BIM framework with six layers: application; service domain; BIM business domain; presentation; data; and infrastructure. The BIM framework provides a holistic approach and organizes relevant knowledge required to tackle construction waste effectively at the design stage using an architecture-based layered approach. This framework will be of interest to software developers and BIM practitioners who seek to extend the functionalities of existing BIM software for construction waste management.","Ai","University of the West of England"

Using an adapted sociometric methodology to combine systemic functional linguistics and sign linguistics, a survey identifies the elements of context that have an effect upon the level of linguistic formality employed by British Sign Language users. The responses of 51 participants are analysed in order to ascertain (i) the level of linguistic formality that would be employed in certain communicative scenarios, and (ii) the contextual features of these scenarios that have an influence on linguistic formality. The results obtained from this study posit that there is an overall agreement shared between British Sign Language users when choosing levels of linguistic formality based on broad contextual description alone. The people involved in the communication and their interpersonal relationships tend to be the biggest influence on the level of formality employed, whereas the topic of the interaction appears to show no significant influence upon linguistic formality on its own. This work contributes further evidence to the importance of studying language within communicative contexts and the importance of formality as an influential factor in linguistic production.

Can a healthy environment for all social groups be delivered through capitalism via market mechanisms? Or is it the capitalist system, itself, that has been at the root of the environmental and social crises we now face? This letter engages with this ongoing debate by drawing on material from a wider study, 'Achieving Environmental Justice', which examined the extent, form and causes of environmental justice and injustice in a range of countries with varying depths of marketization - United States, South Korea, United Kingdom, Sweden, China, Bolivia and Cuba. The analysis described here focuses on the interview material from this mixed methods study, drawing on over 140 interviews with officials, policy makers, and civil society leaders. The letter argues that there is an apparent propensity for capitalist processes to exacerbate, rather than reduce, environmental problems and inequities though the pursuit of relentless economic growth and profit accumulation. Therefore, we should perhaps let go of efforts to resolve environmental injustice within the constraints of capitalism and, instead, build an alternative economic system that can meet human needs in the context of a harmonious and respectful relationship with nature.","Ai","University of the West of England"

Zheltovodov; Jian Fang;  Yufeng Yao; Zhaorui Li; Lipeng Lu","Dec 1, 2015","© 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. The M = 2.9 supersonic turbulent flows over a tandem expansion-compression corner configuration with a sharp deflection angle of 25° at three Reynolds numbers Reδ = 20 000, 40 000, and 80 000 were studied by using direct numerical simulation. The flow statistics were validated against available experimental measurements and other numerical predictions. The flow structures and turbulence statistics were detailed visualized and analysed for the Reδ = 40 000 case, especially in the interaction region where flow separation and reattachment occurred. It was found that during the expansion process, the boundary layer exhibited a characteristic two-layer structure also discovered in previous experimental studies, and the turbulence evolved differently within these two layers. In the outer layer, the turbulence was consistently suppressed along the ramp to a large extent, while in the inner layer, it was suppressed only in a small region around the expansion corner, and the near-wall quasi-streamwise vortices were well preserved. Flow patterns near the reattachment line have shown the existence of the Görtler-type vortices, which would largely amplify turbulence fluctuations in the near-wall region, thus promoting the regeneration of wall turbulence that in turn contributed to the redevelopment of a downstream turbulent boundary layer. The Reynolds number effects and the characteristics of coherent structures were also discussed. With the increase of the Reynolds number, the separation bubble size decreased, but the pattern and the characteristic size of wall streamlines near the reattachment line were preserved.","Ai","University of the West of England"

Research studies and commercial designs in this area have been largely facilitated by the visual modality which brings diversified functionality and improved usability to HCI interfaces by employing various computer vision techniques. This thesis explores a number of facial cues, such as gender, age and gaze, by performing 2D and 3D based computer vision analysis. The ultimate aim is to create a natural HCI strategy that can fulfil user expectations, augment user satisfaction and enrich user experience by understanding user characteristics and behaviours. To this end, salient features have been extracted and analysed from 2D and 3D face representations; 3D reconstruction algorithms and their compatible real-world imaging systems have been investigated; case study HCI systems have been designed to demonstrate the reliability, robustness, and applicability of the proposed method.  More specifically, an unsupervised approach has been proposed to localise eye centres in images and videos accurately and efficiently. This is achieved by utilisation of two types of geometric features and eye models, complemented by an iris radius constraint and a selective oriented gradient filter specifically tailored to this modular scheme. This approach resolves challenges such as interfering facial edges, undesirable illumination conditions, head poses, and the presence of facial accessories and makeup. Tested on 3 publicly available databases (the BioID database, the GI4E database and the extended Yale Face Database b), and a self-collected database, this method outperforms all the methods in comparison and thus proves to be highly accurate and robust. Based on this approach, a gaze gesture recognition algorithm has been designed to increase the interactivity of HCI systems by encoding eye saccades into a communication channel similar to the role of hand gestures. As well as analysing eye/gaze data that represent user behaviours and reveal user intentions, this thesis also investigates the automatic recognition of user demographics such as gender and age. The Fisher Vector encoding algorithm is employed to construct visual vocabularies as salient features for gender and age classification. Algorithm evaluations on three publicly available databases (the FERET database, the LFW database and the FRCVv2 database) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in both laboratory and unconstrained environments. In order to achieve enhanced robustness, a two-source photometric stereo method has been introduced to recover surface normals such that more invariant 3D facia features become available that can further boost classification accuracy and robustness. A 2D+3D imaging system has been designed for construction of a self-collected dataset including 2D and 3D facial data. Experiments show that utilisation of 3D facial features can increase gender classification rate by up to 6% (based on the self-collected dataset), and can increase age classification rate by up to 12% (based on the Photoface database). Finally, two case study HCI systems, a gaze gesture based map browser and a directed advertising billboard, have been designed by adopting all the proposed algorithms as well as the fully compatible imaging system. Benefits from the proposed algorithms naturally ensure that the case study systems can possess high robustness to head pose variation and illumination variation; and can achieve excellent real-time performance. Overall, the proposed HCI strategy enabled by reliably recognised facial cues can serve to spawn a wide array of innovative systems and to bring HCI to a more natural and intelligent state.","Ai","University of the West of England"

A consequence is that societies are becoming more unequal.  Even in the wealthy global cities modern capitalism is increasing inequality at a formidable rate.  In a new book, Leading the Inclusive City (Policy Press), the author provides an international, comparative analysis of the efforts being made by place-based leaders to create inclusive, sustainable cities.  This article draws on the evidence presented in the book to suggest that place-based leaders can play a significant role in advancing social justice, promoting care for the environment and bolstering community empowerment.  An opening section introduces the idea of place-based power – it provides a context for the subsequent discussion. A second section sets out a new way of conceptualising the roles of place-based leaders in any given context, a framework described as The New Civic Leadership.  This distinguishes five different realms of civic leadership.  The third section provides an example of place-based leadership in action.  It outlines the way local leadership has brought about a remarkable transformation of the central area of Melbourne, Australia.  A final section presents a comparative discussion of three themes relating to place-based leadership and local collaboration: 1) The changing possibilities for place-based leadership in our rapidly globalising world; 2) The need for outward-facing local government leadership given the changing nature of public policy challenges; and 3) The role of place-based leadership in bringing about radical public innovation.","Ai","University of the West of England"

Roos;  Adam Thomas; Bernd Kaina","Jan 1, 2016","© 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited. DNA is vulnerable to damage resulting from endogenous metabolites, environmental and dietary carcinogens, some anti-inflammatory drugs, and genotoxic cancer therapeutics. Cells respond to DNA damage by activating complex signalling networks that decide cell fate, promoting not only DNA repair and survival but also cell death. The decision between cell survival and death following DNA damage rests on factors that are involved in DNA damage recognition, and DNA repair and damage tolerance, as well as on factors involved in the activation of apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and senescence. The pathways that dictate cell fate are entwined and have key roles in cancer initiation and progression. Furthermore, they determine the outcome of cancer therapy with genotoxic drugs. Understanding the molecular basis of these pathways is important not only for gaining insight into carcinogenesis, but also in promoting successful cancer therapy. In this Review, we describe key decision-making nodes in the complex interplay between cell survival and death following DNA damage.","Ai","University of the West of England"

Background: Deletions of the aα-globin genes are the most common genetic abnormalities in the world. Currently multiplex Gap-PCRs are frequently used to identify specific sets of common deletions. However, these assays require significant post-amplification hands on time and cannot be used to identify novel or unexpected deletions. The aim of the current study was to develop a rapid screening test for the detection of all deletions of the aα-globin genes that can be integrated into a high volume clinical laboratory workflow. Methods: A gene ratio assay copy enumeration (GRACE) PCR method was developed by simultaneous amplification of targets in the aα-globin genes (HBA1 and HBA2) and the chloride channel voltage sensitive 7 (CLCN7) reference gene. A novel application of High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis then allowed rapid determination of aα-globin gene copy numbers. The assay was validated using 105 samples with previously determined and 62 samples with unknown aα-globin genotypes. Results: The GRACE-PCR assay detected abnormal aα-globin gene copy numbers in 108 of the 167 samples evaluated. The results were consistent with those from a commercial reverse hybridization assay and no allele drop out was observed. Conclusions: We have successfully developed and validated a GRACE-PCR screening test for the detection of deletions and duplications of the aα-globin genes. The assay is based on copy number determination and has the ability to detect both known and novel deletions of the aα-globin genes. It is a closed tube technique; consequently the risk of amplicon contamination is negligible. Amplification, detection and analysis can be completed within one hour, making it faster, cheaper and simpler than other existing tests and thus well suited as a rapid first step in a clinical laboratory workflow.","Ai","University of the West of England"

Second, a character’s attitude towards, or connection with, the city and its surrounding area exposes significant aspects of his or her personality. A character’s relationship to place reveals a great deal; furthermore, the aspect of temperament that is exposed in the process may be linked to important wider themes of the particular novel in question.

At a time when placements may need to increase, understanding the experience of the GP supervisors responsible for these placements is important. Aim:To explore the views, experiences and needs of GPs who supervise F2 doctors in their practices including their perceptions of the benefits to individuals and practices. Design and setting:A qualitative approach with GPs from across Severn Postgraduate Medical Education who supervise F2 doctors. Method: Semi-structured interviews with 15 GPs between December 2012 and April 2013. Results: GP supervisors are enthusiastic about helping F2 doctors to appreciate the uniqueness of primary care. Workload and responsibility around supervision is considerable making a supportive team important. Working with young, enthusiastic doctors boosts morale in the team. The presence of freshly trained minds prompts GPs to consider their own learning needs. Being a supervisor can increase job satisfaction; the teaching role gives respite from the demanding nature of GP work.

Despite this fact, managerial fixation on short term performance objectives, their penchant fear of the unpredictable future and their sheer inability to face the alternative futures generated in the scenario planning exercises has led to little value capture from this activity. The paper analyzes the factors that determine the willingness of decision-makers, to be actively involved in scenario planning. The authors suggest that effective incentives to promote the interest in this activity and its impact can be found, if we consider the decision-makers, as 'consumers' of certain ideas, concepts, expectations, and competencies. In particular, the paper hypothesizes and validates the assumptions that the selection of appropriate targets for scenario planning, commitment to achieving them, expectations of positive outcomes, increasing the frequency of scenario planning exercises are more likely to be expressed in the growing interest of managers and stakeholders to develop scenarios. The presented results are tested on the most common - intuitive logic approach to scenario planning. The authors expect future research to go further to empirically test the proposed hypotheses, and if possible, ascertain whether similar hypotheses could be generated in the context of other tried and tested scenario planning methodologies such as the probabilistic modified trends, competitive intelligence and cross impact analysis.","Ai","University of the West of England"

Various theorists have noted the wide-ranging problems associated with this, and have pointed toward ethnography as a way of opening up leadership research and investigating it from a new angle. However, to date it remains underrepresented. Potentially, this could be due to the fact that leadership is a largely ill-defined concept, meaning that being able to recognise it in action is a difficult task, compared with more detached methods. Therefore, this paper suggests that a first step may be developing a broader understanding of leadership – building on the work of Smircich and Morgan (1982) and Fairhurst (2007). That is, understanding leadership as constituted by meaning-making and reality definition, which is performed through discourse (or: intersubjective talk, communication, language and interaction) as well as being influenced by Discourse (or: extrasubjective frames of reference). This paper suggests that ethnographic methodologies are apt for studying both, and may be able to shed new light on the phenomenon.","Ai","University of the West of England"

Particular attention is given to the problem of less than expected profitability during and post transformation to service. This research adopts a qualitative approach through the use of a single case study with multiple case examples of the complex engineering service. Findings identify a number of challenges associated with the transformation from product to service provision that include strategy, organisation and enterprise management, contracting, risk, culture and operations. Considering these findings holistically it is suggested that a paradigm shift needs to occur, changing both managers perspective and the business models employed if the firm is to provide a sustainable service offering. New ways of structuring and managing the enterprise to deliver the service value proposition will be required. This will include the development of performance management of all operations across the enterprise required as a minimum to ensure optimum performance of service delivery at lowest cost.","Ai","University of the West of England"
"A review of the Malaysian film industry: Towards better film workflow","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/802102/a-review-of-the-malaysian-film-industry-towards-better-film-workflow","Abdul Riezal Dim","None","Abstract This thesis investigates the existing film workflow processes in Malaysia and aims to explore, review and reflect on the expectations, experiences and preferences and problems experienced by practitioners in the Malaysian film industry. Part of that exploration is an in-depth examination of real practices of colour film workflow, investigating the common myth amongst Malaysian filmmakers that environmental colour temperature affects the image quality of Malaysian films. Analysis of this myth may help to establish why many Malaysian films have been processed through foreign laboratory facilities using foreign expertise. The argument and analysis are based on background analysis and interviewing using video documentation of Malaysian film workflow practices, which provides valuable data for the benefit of the Malaysian film industry. All the processes and evidence from the Malaysian film industry were recorded through qualitative video documentation, alongside quantitative data from filmstrip testing. This mixed action research method forms the main approach together with the use of participatory action research as a tool to narrate the development of the research. In justifying the use of all the data, an explanatory mixed method design has been applied. Indeed, the cooperation with expert witnesses in finding a solution to the research problem brought to the circle of practice-based research processes that validated the research. This validation becoming a central of investigation about the Malaysian film workflow complication. The initial technique (pursing the myth of colour temperature variation) proved inadequate, and, consequently, a broader action research methodology was adopted. As such, the filmstrip test data were used more as a tool to enhance the contributions of the expert witnesses, thereby shifting the direction and strengthening the research findings. It is hoped that the methods used could be transferred to solve other film industry problems This research also proves that the method applied has created new evidence of knowledge transfer in historical and film development context, which benefits the film industry in Malaysia. This development of new knowledge could provide a significant opportunity for future potential research, which will strengthen the colour workflow processes and lead to the development of film practices in Malaysia and the surrounding areas. It is the aim of this research to suggest solutions to the current problems of workflow practices among educators, government agencies and filmmakers in the Malaysian film industry.","Ai","University of the West of England"
"Green infrastructure and urban water management","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/802120/green-infrastructure-and-urban-water-management"," Glyn Everett;  Jessica Lamond; Emily Lawson","Dec 10, 2015","This chapter will first outline the many challenges water poses in modern society, considering the increasing frequency and severity of flooding and droughts as inevitable outcomes of potential climate change and increasing impermeable ground-cover through urbanization and economic development. It will secondly consider recent suggestions of a paradigm shift in thinking around water management, urban spaces, and the co-development of blue and green infrastructure, thus integrating the different means by which water is managed within towns and cities. Following this, it will look at several shifts in policy and practice that provide examples of how this paradigm shift and support of green infrastructure for urban water management could be finding its way into contemporary urban re/developments. Finally, the chapter will consider the principle stakeholders who will be affected by these changes, arguing that they should be at the heart of new infrastructure developments and brought in as early as possible to ensure the co-construction of sustainable and workable solutions within different contexts embodying different sets of interests and socio-economic pressures. Green infrastructure is increasingly being utilized in strategies to meet urban water management goals, and to help ensure that this process of change advances as quickly and equitably as possible, it is essential that all interested parties are able to contribute to the development of effective solutions.","Ai","University of the West of England"
"Cycling infrastructure for reducing cycling injuries in cyclists","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/802141/cycling-infrastructure-for-reducing-cycling-injuries-in-cyclists","Caroline A. Mulvaney; Sherie Smith; Michael C. Watson;  John Parkin; Carol Coupland; Philip Miller; Denise Kendrick; Hugh Mcclintock","Dec 10, 2015","© 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Background: Cycling is an attractive form of transport. It is beneficial to the individual as a form of physical activity that may fit more readily into an individual's daily routine, such as for cycling to work and to the shops, than other physical activities such as visiting a gym. Cycling is also beneficial to the wider community and the environment as a result of fewer motorised journeys. Cyclists are seen as vulnerable road users who are frequently in close proximity to larger and faster motorised vehicles. Cycling infrastructure aims to make cycling both more convenient and safer for cyclists. This review is needed to guide transport planning. Objectives: To: 1. evaluate the effects of different types of cycling infrastructure on reducing cycling injuries in cyclists, by type of infrastructure; 2. evaluate the effects of cycling infrastructure on reducing the severity of cycling injuries in cyclists; 3. evaluate the effects of cycling infrastructure on reducing cycling injuries in cyclists with respect to age, sex and social group. Search methods: We ran the most recent search on 2nd March 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase Classic + Embase(OvidSP), PubMed and 10 other databases. We searched websites, handsearched conference proceedings, screened reference lists of included studies and previously published reviews and contacted relevant organisations. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies which evaluated the effect of cycling infrastructure (such as cycle lanes, tracks or paths, speed management, roundabout design) on cyclist injury or collision rates. Studies had to include a comparator, that is, either no infrastructure or a different type of infrastructure. We excluded studies that assessed collisions that occurred as a result of competitive cycling. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors examined the titles and abstracts of papers obtained from searches to determine eligibility. Two review authors extracted data from the included trials and assessed the risk of bias. We carried out a meta-analysis using the random-effects model where at least three studies reported the same intervention and outcome. Where there were sufficient studies, as a secondary analysis we accounted for changes in cyclist exposure in the calculation of the rate ratios. We rated the quality of the evidence as 'high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low' according to the GRADE approach for the installation of cycle routes and networks. Main results: We identified 21 studies for inclusion in the review: 20 controlled before-after (CBA) studies and one interrupted time series (ITS) study. These evaluated a range of infrastructure including cycle lanes, advanced stop lines, use of colour, cycle tracks, cycle paths, management of the road network, speed management, cycle routes and networks, roundabout design and packages of measures. No studies reported medically-attended or self-reported injuries. There was no evidence that cycle lanes reduce the rate of cycle collisions (rate ratio 1.21, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.08). Taking into account cycle flow, there was no difference in collisions for cyclists using cycle routes and networks compared with cyclists not using cycle routes and networks (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.05). There was statistically significant heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 75%, Chi2 = 8.00 df = 2, P = 0.02) for the analysis adjusted for cycle flow. We judged the quality of the evidence regarding cycle routes and networks as very low and we are very uncertain about the estimate. These analyses are based on findings from CBA studies. From data presented narratively, the use of 20 mph speed restrictions in urban areas may be effective at reducing cyclist collisions. Redesigning specific parts of cycle routes that may be particularly busy or complex in terms of traffic movement may be beneficial to cyclists in terms of reducing the risk of collision. Generally, the conversion of intersections to roundabouts may increase the number of cycle collisions. In particular, the conversion of intersections to roundabouts with cycle lanes marked as part of the circulating carriageway increased cycle collisions. However, the conversion of intersections with and without signals to roundabouts with cycle paths may reduce the odds of collision. Both continuing a cycle lane across the mouth of a side road with a give way line onto the main road, and cycle tracks, may increase the risk of injury collisions in cyclists. However, these conclusions are uncertain, being based on a narrative review of findings from included studies. There is a lack of evidence that cycle paths or advanced stop lines either reduce or increase injury collisions in cyclists. There is also insufficient evidence to draw any robust conclusions concerning the effect of cycling infrastructure on cycling collisions in terms of severity of injury, sex, age, and level of social deprivation of the casualty. In terms of quality of the evidence, there was little matching of intervention and control sites. In many studies, the comparability of the control area to the intervention site was unclear and few studies provided information on other cycling infrastructures that may be in place in the control and intervention areas. The majority of studies analysed data routinely collected by organisations external to the study team, thus reducing the risk of bias in terms of systematic differences in assessing outcomes between the control and intervention groups. Some authors did not take regression-to-mean effects into account when examining changes in collisions. Longer data collection periods pre-and post-installation would allow for regression-to-mean effects and also seasonal and time trends in traffic volume to be observed. Few studies adjusted cycle collision rates for exposure. Authors' conclusions: Generally, there is a lack of high quality evidence to be able to draw firm conclusions as to the effect of cycling infrastructure on cycling collisions. There is a lack of rigorous evaluation of cycling infrastructure.","Ai","University of the West of England"

This discussion reports on the findings of the economic evaluation conducted as part of the trial.  Data on resource use and costs incurred were collected from intervention schools (n = 9). Participant girls from all schools completed EQ-5D-Y forms at T0, T1, T2 to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL). EQ-5D-Y responses were converted into unique health states and then weighted to create utility scores. An area under the curve (AUC) approach was applied to utility scores to calculate the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of the intervention. The average cost to run the intervention per school was £2,401 (SD = £104), with an average cost per girl of £73 (95% CI = £71 to £75). There were no statistically significant differences in EQ-5D-Y utility scores across intervention and control arms at any time point, indicating that no change in HRQoL occurred over time. AUC analysis revealed no difference in intervention and control arm QALYs, resulting in no QALYs gained by the intervention. The BGDP provides useful information on the resource use and monetary value of a school-based physical activity intervention. The lack of change in EQ-5D-Y scores suggests that the measure was unresponsive to changes in a ‘healthy’ school population. Future research may consider alternative HRQoL measures, which are appropriate to the population under investigation which is young and healthy.","Ai","University of the West of England"
"Social epistemology and online knowledge exchange","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/802272/social-epistemology-and-online-knowledge-exchange","Dr Paul Matthews","None","This document summarises the submitted research which has investigated online knowledge exchange and related it to the philosophical field of social epistemology. The broad aims have been: firstly to investigate what social epistemology theory can offer in the way of guidance and evaluative frameworks for the design of knowledge systems; and secondly, to determine what the empirical study of knowledge exchange platforms can tell us about epistemology as emerging from online practice. The submitted work consists of six papers that are a mixture of review/position papers and reports of empirical investigation. These have been published in information science journals and conference proceedings. However, following the established tradition of information science, the work is positioned as being cross disciplinary in ambition.  After introducing the submitted papers and the inspiration for the research, the main theoretical positions of the research are outlined and justified. These were a naturalised social epistemological position, inspired by Alvin Goldman, but widened to a situated and systems-oriented view. The naturalised view of epistemology allows for consideration of evidence from psychology, and here some key theories in social and cognitive psychology are outlined. Finally, as the subject is human-computer-human interaction, the sociotechnical setting is established. Further, the main platforms of study in the empirical work — social question answering systems — are introduced and described.  The main methodology and research approaches followed are presented next. A mixed methods philosophy was deemed suitable for this area of research and — alongside the review work — the broad web science method of combining network and data investigation with qualitative methods is justified. Review work included early collaborations with an information scientist and a philosopher which helped to bring together and clarify epistemological and sociotechnical themes.   The discussion section presents some of the main themes and conclusions of the submitted work, including: 1) The identification of knowledge patterns and practices online; 2) Criteria for online knowledge exchange distilled from the social epistemology literature; 3) Some triangulations where theory from philosophy and psychology seemed to corroborate and serve to explain online behaviour; 4) Socio-temporal aspects to online knowledge exchange that are perhaps under developed in philosophy but apparent in practice; 5) Credibility cues and bias, seen as crucial to a rounded study of user interaction with online sources; and finally 6) Interventions suggested by the research which would aim to raise the quality and effectiveness of social media knowledge systems.  Finally, conclusions and suggestions for further work are presented. These follow on from the submitted strands of research and present possibilities for how the work may be extended and improved upon.  In common with the research, these combine philosophy, modelling, interaction design and qualitative methods. Such a combination is seen as essential to developing an enhanced understanding of how the web serves and could serve as a platform for human knowledge.","Ai","University of the West of England"

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conduct an in-depth exploratory test of the innovative culture-based development (CBD) concept and to evaluate its potential for empirical research. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use the partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM) method to look closely at the latently present factor culture and investigate its various possible relationships with the rest of the sub-components of socio-economic development. The authors estimate two alternative specifications of the CBD model, with regional data for Germany in 2006. Findings - The main finding is that according to the PLS-PM quality criteria, the CBD model is a suitable approach for measuring the cultural impact on regional level. The expected sign of the cultural effect suggested by the CBD concept is also confirmed by the results. Originality/value - The authors identify interesting potential bottlenecks in applying the CBD concept incorrectly and demonstrate the PLS-PM potential to control for them.","Ai","University of the West of England"

Henley;  Tim Craig; Dina Anderson; Ashley J. Evans; Fatima Girach","Dec 4, 2015","Neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal is under very precise spatial and temporal control. Following neurotransmitter release, synaptic vesicles are recycled by endocytosis and refilled with neurotransmitter. During the exocytosis event leading to release, SNARE proteins provide most of the mechanical force for membrane fusion. Here, we show one of these proteins, Syntaxin1A, is SUMOylated near its C-terminal transmembrane domain in an activity-dependent manner. Preventing SUMOylation of Syntaxin1A reduces its interaction with other SNARE proteins and disrupts the balance of synaptic vesicle endo/exocytosis, resulting in an increase in endocytosis. These results indicate that SUMOylation regulates the emerging role of Syntaxin1A in vesicle endocytosis, which in turn, modulates neurotransmitter release and synaptic function.","Ai","University of the West of England"

During the 2012–2014 rotavirus seasons, children presenting to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children Emergency Department with gastroenteritis symptoms had stool virology analysis (real-time PCR) and clinical outcome recorded. Nosocomial cases were identified as patients with non-gastroenteritis diagnosis testing positive for rotavirus > 48h after admission. In comparison to average pre-vaccine seasons, in the first year after vaccine introduction there were 48% fewer attendances diagnosed with gastroenteritis, 53% reduction in gastroenteritis admissions and a total saving of 330 bed-days occupancy. There was an overall reduction in number of rotavirus-positive stool samples with 94% reduction in children aged under one year and a 65% reduction in those too old to have been vaccinated. In the first year after the introduction of universal vaccination against rotavirus we observed a profound reduction in gastroenteritis presentations and admissions with a substantial possible herd effect seen in older children. Extrapolating these findings to the UK population we estimate secondary healthcare savings in the first year of ca £7.5 (€10.5) million. Ongoing surveillance will be required to determine the long-term impact of the RV immunisation programme.","Ai","University of the West of England"

Dementia is an umbrella term for a large number of illnesses, all of which involve neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The most common forms of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, but there are over 100 other, rarer conditions. All of these different illnesses involve a progressive decline of cognitive functions in which symptoms gradually spread, so that eventually almost all areas of cognitive functioning are affected. Over time, these cognitive changes compromise the person’s practical ability to manage everyday activities, leading to increasing levels of dependency on those around them. At present there is no cure for any form of dementia. If we are to achieve an understanding of the psychological impact of dementia, then we also need to understand the way in which dementia acts as an existential threat. Dementia can compromise identity, challenge independence, prompt social isolation and threaten our ability to find meaning and purpose in life.

The media’s portrayal of women is often sexually objectifying, and greater exposure to objectifying media is associated with higher levels of self-objectification among young women. One reason why media usage may be associated with self-objectification is because women may be comparing their appearance to others in the media. The present study examined (a) the relationship between the usage of different media types (online social media [Facebook], Internet, television, music videos, and magazines) and self-objectification among young women, (b) whether appearance comparison tendencies in general mediated any observed relationships, and (c) whether appearance comparisons to specific types of women on Facebook (self, family, close friends, distant peers, and celebrities) mediated any relationship between Facebook usage and self-objectification. Female participants (N = 150) aged 17–25 years completed questionnaires about their media usage, appearance comparison tendency in general, appearance comparisons to specific target groups on Facebook, and self-objectification. Results showed that Facebook usage and magazine usage were positively correlated with self-objectification and that these relationships were mediated by appearance comparisons in general. In addition, the relationship between Facebook usage and self-objectification was mediated by comparisons to one’s peers on Facebook. These findings suggest that appearance comparisons can play an important role in self-objectification among young women.","Ai","University of the West of England"

In Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs), the recovery of water can be achieved with the help of both active (electro-osmosis), and passive (osmosis) transport pathways of electrolyte through the semi-permeable selective separator. The electrical current-dependent transport, results in cations and electro-osmotically dragged water molecules reaching the cathode. The present study reports on the production of catholyte on the surface of the cathode, which was achieved as a direct result of electricity generation using MFCs fed with wastewater, and employing Pt-free carbon based cathode electrodes. The highest pH levels (>13) of produced liquid were achieved by the MFCs with the activated carbon cathodes producing the highest power (309 μW). Caustic catholyte formation is presented in the context of beneficial cathode flooding and transport mechanisms, in an attempt to understand the effects of active and passive diffusion. Active transport was dominant under closed circuit conditions and showed a linear correlation with power performance, whereas osmotic (passive) transport was governing the passive flux of liquid in open circuit conditions. Caustic catholyte was mineralised to a mixture of carbonate and bicarbonate salts (trona) thus demonstrating an active carbon capture mechanism as a result of the MFC energy-generating performance. Carbon capture would be valuable for establishing a carbon negative economy and environmental sustainability of the wastewater treatment process.","Ai","University of the West of England"

A participatory action approach was used to design and evaluate the acceptability of the Realshare online community. Pre and post-intervention focus groups were conducted and participants were asked to test out Realshare during two intervention periods: when a facilitator was present and when one was not. Focus group data and forum messages were thematically analysed. The themes identified related to participants' website design requirements, how they used the community and the evaluation of Realshare after having used it. Amendments were made to Realshare throughout the project. Realshare is available to young oncology patients in the South West of England.","Ai","University of the West of England"
"Defining tafoni: Re-examining terminological ambiguity for cavernous rock decay phenomena","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/802523/defining-tafoni-re-examining-terminological-ambiguity-for-cavernous-rock-decay-phenomena","Thomas R. Paradise; Casey D. Allen; Kaelin M. Groom;  Lisa Mol; Kevin Hall","Dec 1, 2015","© 2015, © The Author(s) 2015. Cavernous rock decay processes represent a global phenomenon, ubiquitous to all environments, with the viewable-in-landscape form usually being the final descriptor (e.g. “alveoli”), sometimes alluding to the specific decay process (e.g. “pitting”), other times not (e.g. “honeycombing”). Yet, definitive terminology remains inconsistent, usually owing to variability in dimension, morphometry, distribution, and/or academic lineage. This lack of an established lexicon limits scientific collaboration and can generate scientific bias. With no official consensus on appropriate distinctions, researchers and scientists must either be familiar with all the possible terminology, or know the apparent distinction between “forms”—which can seem arbitrary and, even more frustrating, often differs from researcher to researcher, scientist to scientist. This article reviews the historical and contemporary progression of scientific inquiry into this decay—and, arguably, erosional—feature to identify lexical inconsistencies and promote a singular unifying term for future scholars. Ultimately, the authors support using “tafoni” (singular: “tafone”) as the non-scalar universal term—the form created by numerous processes involved in cavernous decay features—and strongly suggest researchers adopt the same vernacular in order to promote collaboration.","Ai","University of the West of England"
"Nursing culture: An enemy of evidence-based practice? A focus group exploration","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/802538/nursing-culture-an-enemy-of-evidence-based-practice-a-focus-group-exploration","Ellen M. Henderson; Margaret Fletcher","Dec 1, 2015","© 2014, © The Author(s) 2014. Evidence-based practice (EBP) is challenging for most nurses due to the time constraints of caring for patients and the emerging pressures of a changing health service. To explore these challenges, and thus to establish possible means of overcoming them, three focus groups (n = 17) with children’s nurses were conducted. Participants were asked how they would define EBP, what the barriers to EBP were, what skills they needed to help access evidence and how they could integrate evidence into everyday practice. Data were analysed thematically and the anticipated themes of definitions of EBP, barriers, education and nursing culture were determined. Important subthemes were personal and employer disengagement, passivity and lack of resource utilisation. Passive use of evidence readily available in patient folders and on the wards was common. It seemed that little consideration was given to how often this evidence was updated. Nurses define their access to evidence as primarily passive in nature. This is reinforced by a lack of ready access to ongoing education and a perceived lack of investment at institutional level in their continued engagement with evidence. Promoting EBP needs to engage more with those ritual and traditional aspects of nursing culture to challenge these perceptions.","Ai","University of the West of England"
"Patient-directed therapy during in-patient stroke rehabilitation: Stroke survivors' views of feasibility and acceptability","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/802546/patient-directed-therapy-during-in-patient-stroke-rehabilitation-stroke-survivors-views-of-feasibility-and-acceptability","Maria Horne; Nessa Thomas;  Candy McCabe; Rudd Selles; Andy Vail; Pippa Tyrrell; Sarah Tyson","Dec 4, 2015","© 2015 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved. Purpose: Patient-led therapy, in which patients work outside therapy sessions without direct supervision, is a possible way to increase the amount of therapy stroke patients' receive without increasing staff demands. Here, we report patients' views of patient-led mirror therapy and lower limb exercises. Method: 94 stroke survivors with upper and lower limb limitations at least 1-week post-stroke undertook 4 weeks of daily patient-led mirror therapy or lower limb exercise, then completed questionnaires regarding their experience and satisfaction. A convenience random sample of 20 participants also completed a semi-structured telephone interview to consider their experience in more detail and to capture their longer term impressions. Results: Participants were generally positive about patient-led therapy. About 71% found it useful; 68% enjoyed it; 59% felt it ""worked"" and 88% would recommend it to other patients. Exercise was viewed more positively than the mirror therapy. Difficulties included arranging the equipment and their position, particularly for more severe strokes, loss of motivation and concerns about working unsupervised. Conclusions: Patient-led mirror therapy and lower limb exercises during in-patient rehabilitation is generally feasible and acceptable to patients but ""light touch"" supervision to deal with any problems, and strategies to maintain focus and motivation are needed. ▸ Implications for Rehabilitation • Most stroke patients receive insufficient therapy to maximize recovery during rehabilitation. As increases in staffing are unlikely there is an imperative to find ways for patients to increase the amount of exercise and practice of functional tasks they undertake without increasing demands on staff. • Patient-led therapy (also known as patient-directed therapy or independent practice), in which patients undertake exercises or functional tasks practice prescribed by a professional outside formal therapy sessions is one way of achieving this. It is widely used in community-based rehabilitation but is uncommon in hospital-based stroke care. • We explored the feasibility and acceptability of two types of patient-led therapy during hospital-based stroke care; mirror therapy for the upper limb and exercises (without a mirror) for the lower limb. Here, we report patients' experiences of undertaking patient-led therapy. • Patient-led mirror therapy and lower limb exercises during in-patient stroke rehabilitation is generally feasible and acceptable to patients but ""light touch"" supervision to deal with any problems, and strategies to maintain focus and motivation are needed.","Ai","University of the West of England"
"A conceptual framework for the implementation of quality management systems","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/802567/a-conceptual-framework-for-the-implementation-of-quality-management-systems","Professor Vikas Kumar; Luis Rocha-Lona; Jose Arturo Garza-Reyes; Garza-Reyes Jose; Rocha-Lona Luis; Kumar Vikas","Dec 2, 2015","© 2014 Taylor  &  Francis. Some evidence suggests that Quality Management Systems (QMSs) make a positive contribution towards the competitiveness of organisations. However, evidence also suggests that organisations find their implementation difficult, and in many cases they are unsuccessful. This paper presents a conceptual framework that systematically guides organisations through a five-stage process to effectively implement and/or improve their QMSs and core business processes. The framework can be modified or amended to be adapted to the needs of specific industries and organisations. The paper discusses some of the main issues associated with the implementation of QMSs and summarises some of the frameworks and models that have been suggested for this purpose. Then, the paper explains, in detail, all the stages and activities of which the proposed conceptual framework consists. This paper's main contribution consists of the proposal of an alternative and novel approach for the implementation/improvement of QMS and business processes.","Ai","University of the West of England"
"Trends in admission and death rates due to paediatric head injury in England, 2000-2011","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/802582/trends-in-admission-and-death-rates-due-to-paediatric-head-injury-in-england-2000-2011","Robin Marlow; Professor Julie Mytton; Ian K. Maconochie; Hazel Taylor;  Mark Lyttle","Dec 1, 2015","Background The number of children admitted to hospital is increasing year on year, with very short-stay admissions doubling in the last decade. Childhood head injury accounts for half a million emergency department attendances in the UK every year. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has issued three iterations of evidence-based national guidance for head injury since 2003. Objectives To assess if any changes in the rates of admission, death or causes of head injury could be temporally associated with the introduction of sequential national guidelines by longitudinal analysis of the epidemiology of paediatric head injury admissions in England from 2000 to 2011. Methods Retrospective analysis of English Hospital Episode Statistics data of children under the age of 16 years old admitted to hospital with the discharge diagnosis of head injury. Results The number of hospital admissions with paediatric head injury in England rose by 10% from 34 150 in 2000 to 37 430 in 2011, with the proportion admitted for less than 1 day rising from 38% to 57%. The main cause of head injury was falls (42-47%). Deaths due to head injury decreased by 52% from 76 in 2000 to 40 in 2011. Road traffic accidents were the main cause of death in the year 2000 (67%) but fell to 40% by 2011. In 2000, children who were admitted or died from head injuries were more than twice as likely to come from the most deprived homes compared with least deprived homes. By 2011, the disparity for risk of admission had narrowed, but no change was seen for risk of death. Conclusions Temporal relationships exist between implementation of NICE head injury guidance and increased admissions, shorter hospital stay and reduced mortality. The underlying cause of this association is likely to be multifactorial.","Ai","University of the West of England"
