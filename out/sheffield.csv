"Decision-making in communication aid recommendations in the UK : cultural and contextual influencers.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/149036/","Lynch, Y.; Murray, J.; Moulam, L.","March 2019","High-tech communication aids are one form of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention offered to children following an assessment process to identify the most appropriate system based on their needs. Professional recommendations are likely to include consideration of child characteristics and communication aid attributes. Recommendations may be influenced by contextual factors related to the cultural work practices and service context of professionals involved, as well as by contextual factors from the child’s life including their family environment and wider settings. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of cultural and contextual factors on the real-time decision-making processes of specialized AAC professionals in the UK. A total of six teams were recruited to the study. Each team carried out an assessment appointment related to a communication aid recommendation for a child and family. Following the appointment, each team participated in a focus group examining their decision-making processes during the preceding assessment. Inductive coding was used to analyse the transcribed data, and three organizing themes emerged relating to the global theme of Cultural and Contextual Influencers on communication aid decision-making. An explanatory model was developed to illustrate the funnelling effect that contextual factors may have on decision-making, which can substantially alter the nature and timing of a communication aid recommendation. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.","Tech","University of Sheffield"
"Responsive architecture and the problem of obsolescence.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/82925/","Meagher, M.","May 2014","Responsive architecture, a design field that has arisen in recent decades at the intersection of architecture and computer science, invokes a material response to digital information and implies the capacity of the building to respond dynamically to changing stimuli. The question I will address in the paper is whether it is possible for the responsive components of architecture to become a poetically expressive part of the building, and if so why this result has so rarely been achieved in contemporary and recent built work. The history of attitudes to- ward obsolescence in buildings is investigated as one explanation for the rarity of examples like the one considered here that successfully overcomes the rapid obsolescence of responsive components and makes these elements an integral part of the work of architecture. In conclusion I identify strategies for the design of responsive components as poetically expressive elements of architecture.","Tech","University of Sheffield"
"Analysis of ocean ontologies in three frameworks: a study of law of the sea discourse.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/190698/","Burns, V.","August 2022","Legal frameworks have historically used a colonial territorialist approach to governing ocean space. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982) represents a theoretical departure from colonial territorialism. Instead, UNCLOS employs a functionalist logic approach that is based on principles of sovereignty and consent and uses administrative reasoning as a basis for decision-making. This paper investigates what ontological principles are employed in the development of UNCLOS and asks how these are reproduced in other frameworks. I consider whether ontologies can be extrapolated and studied as latent but agential positions in ocean law and governance frameworks and examine how they might be obstructive to the development of effective regional ocean governance. Lastly, I ask whether ontological principles can be reformed, and through what type of interventions this might be achieved. Results show that tenets of colonial territorialism persist in UNCLOS as terrestrialising practices that are reappropriated towards marine communities. Further, that there are fundamental ways in which ontological principles are obstructive to conservation goals in ocean governance frameworks. Lastly, while the structural reproduction of ontological principles between frameworks resists intervention, evidence suggests that interventionist legal mechanisms that displace anthropocentrisms may offer distinct opportunities for reform.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Things that cling: marine attachments in Eliot.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/182124/","Murray, R.","August 2021","T.S. Eliot was captivated by marine life forms, particularly creatures that cling. From the “ragged claws” of ancient crustaceans to the firm foothold of the “delicate algae and the sea anemone,” Eliot’s writing is full of creatures whose instinct is to “ hold on tight” while the sea tosses them about. Eliot’s marine imagery is bound up with his thinking about the enabling possibilities of attachment—an idea that runs counter to his longstanding critical reputation as a poet of detachment. From his early reading of biological texts to his late critical writing, Eliot’s work demonstrates a recurrent interest in attachment that serves to complicate and enrich our understanding of his aesthetics.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Ten years of demographic modelling of divergence and speciation in the sea.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/188672/","De Jode, A.; Le Moan, A.; Johannesson, K.","May 2022","Understanding population divergence that eventually leads to speciation is essential for evolutionary biology. High species diversity in the sea was regarded as a paradox when strict allopatry was considered necessary for most speciation events because geographical barriers seemed largely absent in the sea, and many marine species have high dispersal capacities. Combining genome-wide data with demographic modelling to infer the demographic history of divergence has introduced new ways to address this classical issue. These models assume an ancestral population that splits into two subpopulations diverging according to different scenarios that allow tests for periods of gene flow. Models can also test for heterogeneities in population sizes and migration rates along the genome to account, respectively, for background selection and selection against introgressed ancestry. To investigate how barriers to gene flow arise in the sea, we compiled studies modelling the demographic history of divergence in marine organisms and extracted preferred demographic scenarios together with estimates of demographic parameters. These studies show that geographical barriers to gene flow do exist in the sea but that divergence can also occur without strict isolation. Heterogeneity of gene flow was detected in most population pairs suggesting the predominance of semipermeable barriers during divergence. We found a weak positive relationship between the fraction of the genome experiencing reduced gene flow and levels of genome-wide differentiation. Furthermore, we found that the upper bound of the ‘grey zone of speciation’ for our dataset extended beyond that found before, implying that gene flow between diverging taxa is possible at higher levels of divergence than previously thought. Finally, we list recommendations for further strengthening the use of demographic modelling in speciation research. These include a more balanced representation of taxa, more consistent and comprehensive modelling, clear reporting of results and simulation studies to rule out nonbiological explanations for general results.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Progress towards an HF radar wind speed measurement method using machine learning.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/185959/","Wyatt, L.","April 2022","HF radars are now an important part of operational coastal observing systems where they are used primarily for measuring surface currents. Their use for wave and wind direction measurement has also been demonstrated. These measurements are based on physical models of radar backscatter from the ocean surface described in terms of its ocean wave directional spectrum and the influence thereon of the surface current. Although this spectrum contains information about the local wind that is generating the wind sea part of the spectrum, it also includes spectral components propagating into the local area having been generated by winds away from the area i.e., swell. In addition, the relationship between the local wind sea and wind speed depends on fetch and duration. Thus, finding a physical model to extract wind speed from the radar signal is not straightforward. In this paper, methods that have been proposed to date will be briefly reviewed and an alternative approach is developed using machine learning methods. These have been applied to three different data sets using different radar systems in different locations. The results presented here are encouraging and proposals for further development are outlined.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Applying the Hilbert Envelope method to refine the ultrasonic technique for piston ring oil film thickness measurements in a marine diesel engine.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/187456/","Rooke, J.; Li, X.; Dwyer-Joyce, R.S.","April 2022","The greatest frictional contributor in an internal combustion engine is the contact between the piston ring pack and cylinder liner. Therefore, an improved lubrication regime has the potential to raise engine efficiency while lowering emissions, aiding to meet environmental regulations. Previous ultrasonic measurements of the oil film thickness (OFT) between piston rings and the cylinder liner in a marine engine have been subject to several unexpected trends. This article refines the measurement to identify and remove these factors, the trends were found to have arisen due to the detection of ultrasonic reflections from the piston ring outside of the expected alignment zone. The extent of these undesired reflections is thought to be due to the liner thickness providing a relatively large distance for spreading of the ultrasonic wavefront. The hitherto used Frequency Index method (index of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) at the transducer central frequency) has been compared to the Hilbert Envelope method (index at the peak of the Hilbert Envelope) to define the reflection coefficient. The Hilbert Envelope method was found to minimize the impact from reflections outside of the alignment zone, leading to more consistent and expected trends in the reflection coefficient. The OFT determined using the Hilbert Envelope method was typically 20% greater than that of the Frequency Index method, indicating the previous method provided an underestimation of the film thickness. Using the Hilbert Envelope method, the OFT for the first piston ring at the top dead center (TDC) was found to vary from 8.9 μm at full load to 10.4 μm at 25% loading.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Biological trait profiles discriminate between native and non-indigenous marine invertebrates.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/185538/","Quell, F.; Schratzberger, M.; Beauchard, O.","July 2021","The increasing rate of marine invasions to Western Europe in recent decades highlights the importance of addressing the central questions of invasion biology: what allows an invader to be successful, and which species are likely to become invasive? Consensus is currently lacking regarding the key traits that determine invasiveness in marine species and the extent to which invasive and indigenous species differ in their trait compositions. This limits the ability to predict invasive potential. Here we propose a method based on trait profiles which can be used to predict non-indigenous species likely to cause the greatest impact and native species with a tendency for invasion. We compiled a database of 12 key biological and life history traits of 85 non-indigenous and 302 native marine invertebrate species from Western Europe. Using multivariate methods, we demonstrate that biological traits were able to discriminate between native and non-indigenous species with an accuracy of 78%. The main discriminant traits included body size, lifespan, fecundity, offspring protection, burrowing depth and, to a lesser extent, pelagic stage duration. Analysis revealed that the typical non-indigenous marine invertebrate is a mid-sized, long-lived, highly fecund suspension feeder which either broods its offspring or has a pelagic stage duration of 1–30 days, and is either attached-sessile or burrows to a depth of 5 cm. Biological traits were also able to predict native species classed as “potentially invasive” with an accuracy of 78%. Targeted surveillance and proactive management of invasive species requires accurate predictions of which species are likely to become invasive in the future. Our findings add to the growing evidence that non-indigenous species possess a greater affinity for certain traits. These traits are typically present in the profile of “potentially invasive” native species.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Pattern, style and timing of British–Irish Ice Sheet advance and retreat over the last 45 000 years: evidence from NW Scotland and the adjacent continental shelf.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/174135/","Bradwell, T.; Fabel, D.; Clark, C.D.","February 2021","Predicting the future response of ice sheets to climate warming and rising global sea level is important but difficult. This is especially so when fast‐flowing glaciers or ice streams, buffered by ice shelves, are grounded on beds below sea level. What happens when these ice shelves are removed? And how do the ice stream and the surrounding ice sheet respond to the abruptly altered boundary conditions? To address these questions and others we present new geological, geomorphological, geophysical and geochronological data from the ice‐stream‐dominated NW sector of the last British–Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS). The study area covers around 45 000 km2 of NW Scotland and the surrounding continental shelf. Alongside seabed geomorphological mapping and Quaternary sediment analysis, we use a suite of over 100 new absolute ages (including cosmogenic‐nuclide exposure ages, optically stimulated luminescence ages and radiocarbon dates) collected from onshore and offshore, to build a sector‐wide ice‐sheet reconstruction combining all available evidence with Bayesian chronosequence modelling. Using this information we present a detailed assessment of ice‐sheet advance/retreat history, and the glaciological connections between different areas of the NW BIIS sector, at different times during the last glacial cycle. The results show a highly dynamic, partly marine, partly terrestrial, ice‐sheet sector undergoing large size variations in response to sub‐millennial‐scale climatic (Dansgaard–Oeschger) cycles over the last 45 000 years. Superimposed on these trends we identify internally driven instabilities, operating at higher frequency, conditioned by local topographic factors, tidewater dynamics and glaciological feedbacks during deglaciation. Specifically, our new evidence indicates extensive marine‐terminating ice‐sheet glaciation of the NW BIIS sector during Greenland Stadials 12 to 9 – prior to the main ‘Late Weichselian’ ice‐sheet glaciation. After a period of restricted glaciation, in Greenland Interstadials 8 to 6, we find good evidence for rapid renewed ice‐sheet build‐up in NW Scotland, with the Minch ice‐stream terminus reaching the continental shelf edge in Greenland Stadial 5, perhaps only briefly. Deglaciation of the NW sector took place in numerous stages. Several grounding‐zone wedges and moraines on the mid‐ and inner continental shelf attest to significant stabilizations of the ice‐sheet grounding line, or ice margin, during overall retreat in Greenland Stadials 3 and 2, and to the development of ice shelves. NW Lewis was the first substantial present‐day land area to deglaciate, in the first half of Greenland Stadial 3 at a time of globally reduced sea‐level c. 26 ka bp, followed by Cape Wrath at c. 24 ka bp. The topographic confinement of the Minch straits probably promoted ice‐shelf development in early Greenland Stadial 2, providing the ice stream with additional support and buffering it somewhat from external drivers. However, c. 20–19 ka bp, as the grounding‐line migrated into shoreward deepening water, coinciding with a marked change in marine geology and bed strength, the ice stream became unstable. We find that, once underway, grounding‐line retreat proceeded in an uninterrupted fashion with the rapid loss of fronting ice shelves – first in the west, then the east troughs – before eventual glacier stabilization at fjord mouths in NW Scotland by ~17 ka bp. Around the same time, ~19–17 ka bp, ice‐sheet lobes readvanced into the East Minch – possibly a glaciological response to the marine‐instability‐triggered loss of adjacent ice stream (and/or ice shelf) support in the Minch trough. An independent ice cap on Lewis also experienced margin oscillations during mid‐Greenland Stadial 2, with an ice‐accumulation centre in West Lewis existing into the latter part of Heinrich Stadial 1. Final ice‐sheet deglaciation of NW mainland Scotland was punctuated by at least one other coherent readvance at c. 15.5 ka bp, before significant ice‐mass losses thereafter. At the glacial termination, c. 14.5 ka bp, glaciers fed outwash sediment to now‐abandoned coastal deltas in NW mainland Scotland around the time of global Meltwater Pulse 1A. Overall, this work on the BIIS NW sector reconstructs a highly dynamic ice‐sheet oscillating in extent and volume for much of the last 45 000 years. Periods of expansive ice‐sheet glaciation dominated by ice‐streaming were interspersed with periods of much more restricted ice‐cap or tidewater/fjordic glaciation. Finally, this work indicates that the role of ice streams in ice‐sheet evolution is complex but mechanistically important throughout the lifetime of an ice sheet – with ice streams contributing to the regulation of ice‐sheet health but also to the acceleration of ice‐sheet demise via marine ice‐sheet instabilities.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Maximum extent and readvance dynamics of the Irish Sea Ice Stream and Irish Sea Glacier since the Last Glacial Maximum.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/174565/","Scourse, J.D.; Chiverrell, R.C.; Smedley, R.K.","March 2021","The BRITICE-CHRONO Project has generated a suite of recently published radiocarbon ages from deglacial sequences offshore in the Celtic and Irish seas and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide and optically stimulated luminescence ages from adjacent onshore sites. All published data are integrated here with new geochronological data from Wales in a revised Bayesian analysis that enables reconstruction of ice retreat dynamics across the basin. Patterns and changes in the pace of deglaciation are conditioned more by topographic constraints and internal ice dynamics than by external controls. The data indicate a major but rapid and very short-lived extensive thin ice advance of the Irish Sea Ice Stream (ISIS) more than 300 km south of St George's Channel to a marine calving margin at the shelf break at 25.5 ka; this may have been preceded by extensive ice accumulation plugging the constriction of St George's Channel. The release event between 25 and 26 ka is interpreted to have stimulated fast ice streaming and diverted ice to the west in the northern Irish Sea into the main axis of the marine ISIS away from terrestrial ice terminating in the English Midlands, a process initiating ice stagnation and the formation of an extensive dead ice landscape in the Midlands.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Comparison of ring-liner oil film thickness resulting from different injector designs in a diesel marine engine using an ultrasound measurement method.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/175864/","Rooke, J.; Li, X.; Brunskill, H.","May 2021","The global drive to combat climate change is a primary driving force towards producing greener and cleaner marine diesel engines to meet emission legislations. The main cause of an engine’s parasitic frictional loss is the interaction between piston rings and the cylinder liner. Therefore, the piston ring lubricating oil film has been the focus of much prior research, chiefly focusing on small-scale automotive engines. This work employs the ultrasonic reflectometry technique to evaluate the oil film formation resulting from different lubricant injector arrangements on a large two-stroke marine diesel engine. A series of piezoelectric transducers close to the top dead center (TDC) have quantified the oil film thickness (OFT) across three engine loading levels and three injector configurations. The injector configurations compare a more traditional pulse-jet (PJ) injector to a needle lift-type (NLT) injector, which reduces the rate of lubricant atomization. The results gathered show that the OFT increases with decreased engine load for all injector systems. The needle lift injector has been shown to increase the minimum OFT for the first ring at the TDC, reducing the likelihood of boundary lubrication for this ring while also reducing the amount of lubricant present in the exhaust manifold.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Towards control of autonomous surface vehicles in rough seas.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/157784/","McCullough, D.R.; Jones, B.; Villarreal, O.J.G.; Findeisen, R.; Hirche, S.; Janschek, K.; Mönnigmann, M.","February 2020","This paper addresses the problem of controlling an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) in rough sea-states, with a view towards minimising wave-induced forces, whilst maintaining headway. This is a challenging control application since, and as is derived in the paper, the interaction between the vessel and the wave disturbance is nonlinear and coupled. This subsequently motivates the novel application of the Real Time Iteration Scheme (RTI) for Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) of the ASV. Analysis of the resulting control signal provides an important insight into the role of the wave encounter frequency. Specifically, by actuating at twice the average wave encounter frequency, the nonlinear controller is able to reduce the wave forces, compared to an open-loop controller that achieves the same average velocity.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"What’s hot and what’s not: making sense of biodiversity ‘hotspots’.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/168454/","Thompson, M.S.A.; Couce, E.; Webb, T.J.","October 2020","Conserving biogeographic regions with especially high biodiversity, known as biodiversity ‘hotspots’, is intuitive because finite resources can be focussed towards manageable units. Yet, biodiversity, environmental conditions and their relationship are more complex with multidimensional properties. Assessments which ignore this risk failing to detect change, identify its direction or gauge the scale of appropriate intervention. Conflicting concepts which assume assemblages as either sharply delineated communities or loosely collected species have also hampered progress in the way we assess and conserve biodiversity. We focus on the marine benthos where delineating manageable areas for conservation is an attractive prospect because it holds most marine species and constitutes the largest single ecosystem on earth by area. Using two large UK marine benthic faunal datasets, we present a spatially gridded data sampling design to account for survey effects which would otherwise be the principal drivers of diversity estimates. We then assess γ‐diversity (regional richness) with diversity partitioned between α (local richness) and β (dissimilarity), and their change in relation to covariates to test whether defining and conserving biodiversity hotspots is an effective conservation strategy in light of the prevailing forces structuring those assemblages. α‐, β‐ and γ‐diversity hotspots were largely inconsistent with each metric relating uniquely to the covariates, and loosely collected species generally prevailed with relatively few distinct assemblages. Hotspots could therefore be an unreliable means to direct conservation efforts if based on only a component part of diversity. When assessed alongside environmental gradients, α‐, β‐ and γ‐diversity provide a multidimensional but still intuitive perspective of biodiversity change that can direct conservation towards key drivers and the appropriate scale for intervention. Our study also highlights possible temporal declines in species richness over 30 years and thus the need for future integrated monitoring to reveal the causal drivers of biodiversity change.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Marine conservation : towards a multi-layered network approach.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/168222/","Jacob, U.; Beckerman, A.; Antonijevic, M.","September 2020","Valuing, managing and conserving marine biodiversity and a full range of ecosystem services is at the forefront of research and policy agendas. However, biodiversity is being lost at up to a thousand times the average background rate. Traditional disciplinary and siloed conservation approaches are not able to tackle this massive loss of biodiversity because they generally ignore or overlook the interactive and dynamic nature of ecosystems processes, limiting their predictability. To conserve marine biodiversity, we must assess the interactions and impacts among biodiversity and ecosystem services (BD-ES). The scaling up in complexity from single species to entire communities is necessary, albeit challenging, for a deeper understanding of how ecosystem services relate to biodiversity and the roles species have in ecosystem service provision. These interactions are challenging to map, let alone fully assess, but network and system-based approaches provide a powerful way to progress beyond those limitations. Here, we introduce a conceptual multi-layered network approach to understanding how ecosystem services supported by biodiversity drive the total service provision, how different stressors impact BD-ES and where conservation efforts should be placed to optimize the delivery of ecosystem services and protection of biodiversity.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Marine20—The marine radiocarbon age calibration curve (0–55,000 cal BP).","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/188238/","Heaton, T.J.; Köhler, P.; Butzin, M.","August 2020","The concentration of radiocarbon (14C) differs between ocean and atmosphere. Radiocarbon determinations from samples which obtained their 14C in the marine environment therefore need a marine-specific calibration curve and cannot be calibrated directly against the atmospheric-based IntCal20 curve. This paper presents Marine20, an update to the internationally agreed marine radiocarbon age calibration curve that provides a non-polar global-average marine record of radiocarbon from 0–55 cal kBP and serves as a baseline for regional oceanic variation. Marine20 is intended for calibration of marine radiocarbon samples from non-polar regions; it is not suitable for calibration in polar regions where variability in sea ice extent, ocean upwelling and air-sea gas exchange may have caused larger changes to concentrations of marine radiocarbon. The Marine20 curve is based upon 500 simulations with an ocean/atmosphere/biosphere box-model of the global carbon cycle that has been forced by posterior realizations of our Northern Hemispheric atmospheric IntCal20 14C curve and reconstructed changes in CO2 obtained from ice core data. These forcings enable us to incorporate carbon cycle dynamics and temporal changes in the atmospheric 14C level. The box-model simulations of the global-average marine radiocarbon reservoir age are similar to those of a more complex three-dimensional ocean general circulation model. However, simplicity and speed of the box model allow us to use a Monte Carlo approach to rigorously propagate the uncertainty in both the historic concentration of atmospheric 14C and other key parameters of the carbon cycle through to our final Marine20 calibration curve. This robust propagation of uncertainty is fundamental to providing reliable precision for the radiocarbon age calibration of marine based samples. We make a first step towards deconvolving the contributions of different processes to the total uncertainty; discuss the main differences of Marine20 from the previous age calibration curve Marine13; and identify the limitations of our approach together with key areas for further work. The updated values for ΔR, the regional marine radiocarbon reservoir age corrections required to calibrate against Marine20, can be found at the data base http://calib.org/marine/.","Marine","University of Sheffield"

We present results of marine reservoir age simulations enabling this resolution, applying the LSG ocean general circulation model forced with various climatic background conditions and with atmospheric radiocarbon changes according to the Hulu Cave speleothem record. Simulating the spatiotemporal evolution of reservoir ages between 54,000 and 10,700 cal BP, we find reservoir ages between 500 and 1400 yr in the low- and mid-latitudes, but also more than 3000 yr in the polar seas. Our results are broadly in agreement with available marine radiocarbon reconstructions, with the caveat that continental margins, marginal seas, or tropical lagoons are not properly resolved in our coarse-resolution model.","Marine","University of Sheffield"

The flat periwinkles, Littorina fabalis and L. obtusata, are two sister species widely distributed throughout the Northern Atlantic shores with high potential to inform us about the process of ecological speciation in the intertidal.

In order to fill these gaps, we sequenced two mitochondrial genes and two nuclear fragments to perform a phylogeographic analysis of flat periwinkles across their distribution range.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Proteorhodopsin overproduction enhances the long-term viability of Escherichia coli.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/154954/","Song, Y.; Cartron, M.L.; Jackson, P.J.","October 2019","Genes encoding the photoreactive protein proteorhodopsin (PR) have been found in a wide range of marine bacterial species, reflecting the significant contribution that PR makes to energy flux and carbon cycling in ocean ecosystems. PR can also confer advantages to enhance the ability of marine bacteria to survive periods of starvation. Here, we investigate the effect of heterologously produced PR on the viability of Escherichia coli. Quantitative mass spectrometry shows that E. coli, exogenously supplied with the retinal cofactor, assembles as many as 187,000 holo-PR molecules per cell, accounting for approximately 47% of the membrane area; even cells with no retinal synthesize ∼148,000 apo-PR molecules per cell. We show that populations of E. coli cells containing PR exhibit significantly extended viability over many weeks, and we use single-cell Raman spectroscopy (SCRS) to detect holo-PR in 9-month-old cells. SCRS shows that such cells, even incubated in the dark and therefore with inactive PR, maintain cellular levels of DNA and RNA and avoid deterioration of the cytoplasmic membrane, a likely basis for extended viability. The substantial proportion of the E. coli membrane required to accommodate high levels of PR likely fosters extensive intermolecular contacts, suggested to physically stabilize the cell membrane and impart a long-term benefit manifested as extended viability in the dark. We propose that marine bacteria could benefit similarly from a high PR content, with a stabilized cell membrane extending survival when those bacteria experience periods of severe nutrient or light limitation in the oceans.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Ship classification and detection based on CNN using GF-3 SAR images.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/140801/","Ma, M.; Chen, J.; Liu, W.","December 2018","Ocean surveillance via high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries has been a hot issue because SAR is able to work in all-day and all-weather conditions. The launch of Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite has provided a large number of SAR imageries, making it possible to marine targets monitoring. However, it is difficult for traditional methods to extract effective features to classify and detect different types of marine targets in SAR images. This paper proposes a convolutional neutral network (CNN) model for marine target classification at patch level and an overall scheme for marine target detection in large-scale SAR images. First, eight types of marine targets in GF-3 SAR images are labelled based on feature analysis, building the datasets for further experiments. As for the classification task at patch level, a novel CNN model with six convolutional layers, three pooling layers, and two fully connected layers has been designed. With respect to the detection part, a Single Shot Multi-box Detector with a multi-resolution input (MR-SSD) is developed, which can extract more features at different resolution versions. In order to detect different targets in large-scale SAR images, a whole workflow including sea-land segmentation, cropping with overlapping, detection with MR-SSD model, coordinates mapping, and predicted boxes consolidation is developed. Experiments based on the GF-3 dataset demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods for marine target classification and detection.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Ecosystem-based management of coral reefs under climate change.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/134278/","Harvey, B.J.; Nash, K.L.; Blanchard, J.L.","March 2018","Coral reefs provide food and livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people as well as

land-use change and other local anthropogenic threats to coral reefs have
left many degraded. Additionally, coral reefs are faced with the dual emerging threats
of ocean warming and acidification due to rising CO2 emissions, with dire predictions
that they will not survive the century. This review evaluates the impacts of climate
change on coral reef organisms, communities and ecosystems, focusing on the interactions
between climate change factors and local anthropogenic stressors. It then
explores the shortcomings of existing management and the move towards ecosystembased
management and resilience thinking, before highlighting the need for climate
change-ready marine protected areas (MPAs), reduction in local anthropogenic
stressors, novel approaches such as human-assisted evolution and the importance of
sustainable socialecological systems. It concludes that designation of climate changeready
MPAs, integrated with other management strategies involving stakeholders
and participation at multiple scales such as marine spatial planning, will be required
to maximise coral reef resilience under climate change. However, efforts to reduce
carbon emissions are critical if the long-term efficacy of local management actions is
to be maintained and coral reefs are to survive. ","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Glaciolacustrine deposits formed in an ice-dammed tributary valley in the south-central Pyrenees: new evidence for late Pleistocene climate.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/127833/","Sancho, C.; Rhodes, E.J.; Arenas, C.","January 2018","Combined geomorphic features, stratigraphic characteristics and sedimentologic interpretation, coupled with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates, of a glacio-fluvio-lacustrine sequence (Linás de Broto, northern Spain) provide new information to understand the palaeoenvironmental significance of dynamics of glacier systems in the south-central Pyrenees during the Last Glacial Cycle (≈130 ka to 14 ka). The Linás de Broto depositional system consisted of a proglacial lake fed primarily by meltwater streams emanating from the small Sorrosal glacier and dammed by a lateral moraine of the Ara trunk glacier. The resulting glacio-fluvio-lacustrine sequence, around 55 m thick, is divided into five lithological units consisting of braided fluvial (gravel deposits), lake margin (gravel and sand deltaic deposits) and distal lake (silt and clay laminites) facies associations. Evolution of the depositional environment reflects three phases of progradation of a high-energy braided fluvial system separated by two phases of rapid expansion of the lake. Fluvial progradation occurred during short periods of ice melting. Lake expansion concurred with ice-dam growth of the trunk glacier. The first lake expansion occurred over a time range between 55 ± 9 ka and 49 ± 11 ka, and is consistent with the age of the Viu lateral moraine (49 ± 8 ka), which marks the maximum areal extent of the Ara glacier during the Last Glacial Cycle. These dates confirm that the maximum areal extent of the glacier occurred during Marine Isotope Stages 4 and 3 in the south-central Pyrenees, thus before the Last Glacial Maximum. The evolution of the Linás de Broto depositional system during this maximum glacier extent was modulated by climate oscillations in the northern Iberian Peninsula, probably related to latitudinal shifts of the atmospheric circulation in the southern North-Atlantic Ocean, and variations in summer insolation intensity.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Evidence for orbital and North Atlantic climate forcing in alpine Southern California between 125 and 10 ka from multi-proxy analyses of Baldwin Lake.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/117010/","Glover, K.C.; MacDonald, G.M.; Kirby, M.E.","April 2017","We employed a new, multi-proxy record from Baldwin Lake (∼125–10 ka) to examine drivers of terrestrial Southern California climate over long timescales. Correlated bulk organic and biogenic silica proxy data demonstrated high-amplitude changes from 125 to 71 ka, suggesting that summer insolation directly influenced lake productivity during MIS 5. From 60 to 57 ka, hydrologic state changes and events occurred in California and the U.S. Southwest, though the pattern of response varied geographically. Intermediate, less variable levels of winter and summer insolation followed during MIS 3 (57–29 ka), which likely maintained moist conditions in Southern California that were punctuated with smaller-order, millennial-scale events. These Dansgaard-Oeschger events brought enhanced surface temperatures (SSTs) to the eastern Pacific margin, and aridity to sensitive terrestrial sites in the Southwest and Southern California. Low temperatures and reduced evaporation are widespread during MIS 2, though there is increasing evidence for moisture extremes in Southern California from 29 to 20 ka. Our record shows that both orbital-scale radiative forcing and rapid North Atlantic temperature perturbations were likely influences on Southern California climate prior to the last glacial. However, these forcings produced a hydroclimatic response throughout California and the U.S. Southwest that was geographically complex. This work highlights that it is especially urgent to improve our understanding of the response to rapid climatic change in these regions. Enhanced temperature and aridity are projected for the rest of the 21st century, which will place stress on water resources.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Cosmogenic exposure age constraints on deglaciation and flow behaviour of a marine-based ice stream in western Scotland, 21–16 ka.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/118025/","Small, D.; Benetti, S.; Dove, D.","April 2017","Understanding how marine-based ice streams operated during episodes of deglaciation requires geochronological data that constrain both timing of deglaciation and changes in their flow behaviour, such as that from unconstrained ice streaming to topographically restricted flow. We present seventeen new 10Be exposure ages from glacial boulders and bedrock at sites in western Scotland within the area drained by the Hebrides Ice Stream, a marine-based ice stream that drained a large proportion of the former British-Irish Ice Sheet. Exposure ages from Tiree constrain deglaciation of a topographic high within the central zone of the ice stream, from which convergent flowsets were produced during ice streaming. These ages thus constrain thinning of the Hebrides Ice Stream, which, on the basis of supporting information, we infer to represent cessation of ice streaming at 20.6 ± 1.2 ka, 3–4 ka earlier than previously inferred. A period of more topographically restricted flow produced flow indicators superimposed on those relating to full ice stream conditions, and exposure ages from up-stream of these constrain deglaciation to 17.5 ± 1.0 ka. Complete deglaciation of the marine sector of the Hebrides Ice Stream occurred by 17–16 ka at which time the ice margin was located near the present coastline. Exposure ages from the southernmost Outer Hebrides (Mingulay and Barra) indicate deglaciation at 18.9 ± 1.0 and 17.1 ± 1.0 ka respectively, demonstrating that an independent ice cap persisted on the southern Outer Hebrides for 3–4 ka after initial ice stream deglaciation. This suggests that deglaciation of the Hebrides Ice Stream was focused along major submarine troughs. Collectively, our data constrain initial deglaciation and changes in flow regime of the Hebrides Ice Stream, final deglaciation of its marine sector, and deglaciation of the southern portion of the independent Outer Hebrides Ice Cap, providing chronological constraints on future numerical reconstructions of this key sector of the former British-Irish Ice Sheet.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Study of solvent-based carbon capture for cargo ships through process modelling and simulation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/114402/","Luo, X.; Wang, M.","March 2017","Controlling anthropogenic CO2 emission is crucial to mitigate global warming. Marine CO2 emissions accounts for around 3% of the total CO2 emission worldwide and grows rapidly with increasing demand for passenger and cargo transport. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted mandatory measures to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions from international shipping. This study aims to explore how to apply solvent-based post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) process to capture CO2 from the energy system in a typical cargo ship and to evaluate the cost degrees of different integration options through simulation-based techno-economic assessments. The selected reference cargo ship has a propulsion system consisting of two four-stroke reciprocating engines at a total power of 17 MW. The study first addressed the challenge on model development of the marine diesel engines and then developed the model of the ship energy system. The limitations of implementing onboard carbon capture were discussed. Two integration options between the ship energy system and the carbon capture process were simulated to analyse the thermal performance of the integrated system and to estimate equipment size of the carbon capture process. It was found that the carbon capture level could only reach 73% when the existing ship energy system is integrated with the PCC process due to limited heat and electricity supply for CCS. The cost of CO2 captured is around 77.50 €/ton CO2. With installation of an additional gas turbine to provide extra energy utilities to the capture plant, the carbon capture level could reach 90% whilst the cost of CO2 captured is around 163.07 €/ton CO2, mainly because of 21.41% more fuel consumption for the additional diesel gas turbine. This is the first systematical study in applying solvent-based carbon capture for ships, which will inspire other researchers in this area.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Experimental Studies of Turbulent Intensity around a Tidal Turbine Support Structure.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/114752/","Walker, S. R.; Cappietti, L.","April 2017","Tidal stream energy is a low-carbon energy source. Tidal stream turbines operate in a turbulent environment, and the effect of the structure between the turbine and seabed on this environment is not fully understood. An experimental study using 1:72 scale models based on a commercial turbine design was carried out to study the support structure influence on turbulent intensity around the turbine blades. The study was conducted using the wave-current tank at the Laboratory of Maritime Engineering (LABIMA), University of Florence. A realistic flow environment (ambient turbulent intensity = 11%) was established. Turbulent intensity was measured upstream and downstream of a turbine mounted on two different support structures (one resembling a commercial design, the other the same with an additional vertical element), in order to quantify any variation in turbulence and performance between the support structures. Turbine drive power was used to calculate power generation. Acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) was used to record and calculate upstream and downstream turbulent intensity. In otherwise identical conditions, performance variation of only 4% was observed between two support structures. Turbulent intensity at 1, 3 and 5 blade diameters, both upstream and downstream, showed variation up to 21% between the two cases. The additional turbulent structures generated by the additional element of the second support structure appears to cause this effect, and the upstream propagation of turbulent intensity is believed to be permitted by surface waves. This result is significant for the prediction of turbine array performance.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Quantifying heterogeneous responses of fish community size structure using novel combined statistical techniques.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/96584/","Marshall, A.M.; Bigg, G.R.; van Leeuwen, S.M.","November 2015","To understand changes in ecosystems, the appropriate scale at which to study them must be determined. Large marine ecosystems (LMEs) cover thousands of square kilometres and are a useful classification scheme for ecosystem monitoring and assessment. However, averaging across LMEs may obscure intricate dynamics within. The purpose of this study is to mathematically determine local and regional patterns of ecological change within an LME using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). After using EOFs to define regions with distinct patterns of change, a statistical model originating from control theory is applied (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous input – NARMAX) to assess potential drivers of change within these regions. We have selected spatial data sets (0.5° latitude × 1°longitude) of fish abundance from North Sea fisheries research surveys (spanning 1980–2008) as well as of temperature, oxygen, net primary production and a fishing pressure proxy, to which we apply the EOF and NARMAX methods. Two regions showed significant changes since 1980: the central North Sea displayed a decrease in community size structure which the NARMAX model suggested was linked to changes in fishing; and the Norwegian trench region displayed an increase in community size structure which, as indicated by NARMAX results, was primarily linked to changes in sea-bottom temperature. These regions were compared to an area of no change along the eastern Scottish coast where the model determined the community size structure was most strongly associated to net primary production. This study highlights the multifaceted effects of environmental change and fishing pressures in different regions of the North Sea. Furthermore, by highlighting this spatial heterogeneity in community size structure change, important local spatial dynamics are often overlooked when the North Sea is considered as a broad-scale, homogeneous ecosystem (as normally is the case within the political Marine Strategy Framework Directive).","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Direct and indirect effects of climate and fishing on changes in coastal ecosystem services: a historical perspective from the North Sea.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/95405/","Selim, S.A.; Blanchard, J.L.; Bedford, J.","June 2014","Humanity depends on the marine environment for a range of vital ecosystem services, at global (e.g. climate regulation), regional (e.g. commercial fisheries) and local scales (e.g. coastal defence and recreation). At the same time, marine ecosystems have been exploited for centuries, and many systems today are under stress from multiple sources. Recent studies have shown how both climate change and fishing have caused long-term changes in the marine environment. However, there is still poor understanding of how these changes influence change in coastal ecosystem services. In this paper, an integrated modelling approach is used to assess how the final delivery of marine ecosystem services to coastal communities is influenced by the direct and indirect effects of changes in ecosystem processes brought about by climate and human impacts, using fisheries of the North Sea region as a case study. Partial least squares path analysis is used to explore the relationships between drivers of change, marine ecosystem processes and services (landings). A simple conceptual model with four variables—climate, fishing effort, ecosystem process and ecosystem services—is applied to the English North Sea using historic ecological, climatic and fisheries time series spanning 1924–2010 to identify the multiple pathways that might exist. As expected, direct and indirect links between fishing effort, ecosystem processes and service provision were significant. However, links between climate and ecosystem processes were weak. This paper highlights how path analysis can be used for analysing long-term temporal links between ecosystem processes and services following a simplified pathway.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"Harnessing the climate mitigation, conservation and poverty alleviation potential of seagrasses : prospects for developing blue carbon initiatives and payment for ecosystem service programmes.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/165330/","Hejnowicz, A.P.; Kennedy, H.; Rudd, M.A.","May 2015","Seagrass ecosystems provide numerous ecosystem services that support coastal communities around the world. They sustain abundant marine life as well as commercial and artisanal fisheries, and help protect shorelines from coastal erosion. Additionally, seagrass meadows are a globally significant sink for carbon and represent a key ecosystem for combating climate change. However, seagrass habitats are suffering rapid global decline. Despite recognition of the importance of “Blue Carbon,” no functioning seagrass restoration or conservation projects supported by carbon finance currently operate, and the policies and frameworks to achieve this have not been developed. Yet, seagrass ecosystems could play a central role in addressing important international research questions regarding the natural mechanisms through which the ocean and the seabed can mitigate climate change, and how ecosystem structure links to service provision. The relative inattention that seagrass ecosystems have received represents both a serious oversight and a major missed opportunity. In this paper we review the prospects of further inclusion of seagrass ecosystems in climate policy frameworks, with a particular focus on carbon storage and sequestration, as well as the potential for developing payment for ecosystem service (PES) schemes that are complementary to carbon management. Prospects for the inclusion of seagrass Blue Carbon in regulatory compliance markets are currently limited; yet despite the risks the voluntary carbon sector offers the most immediately attractive avenue for the development of carbon credits. Given the array of ecosystem services seagrass ecosystems provide the most viable route to combat climate change, ensure seagrass conservation and improve livelihoods may be to complement any carbon payments with seagrass PES schemes based on the provision of additional ecosystem services.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"The genetic structure of Nautilus pompilius populations surrounding Australia and the Philippines.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/86888/","Williams, R.C.; Jackson, B.C.; Duvaux, L.","June 2015","Understanding the distribution of genetic diversity in exploited species is fundamental to successful conservation. Genetic structure and the degree of gene flow among populations must be assessed to design appropriate strategies to prevent the loss of distinct populations. The cephalopod Nautilus pompilius is fished unsustainably in the Philippines for the ornamental shell trade and has limited legislative protection, despite the species' recent dramatic decline in the region. Here, we use 14 microsatellite markers to evaluate the population structure of N. pompilius around Australia and the Philippines. Despite their relative geographical proximity, Great Barrier Reef individuals are genetically isolated from Osprey Reef and Shark Reef in the Coral Sea (FST =0.312, 0.229, respectively). Conversely, despite the larger geographical distances between the Philippines and west Australian reefs, samples display a small degree of genetic structure (FST =0.015). Demographic scenarios modelled using approximate Bayesian computation analysis indicate that this limited divergence is not due to contemporary gene flow between the Philippines and west Australia. Instead, present-day genetic similarity can be explained by very limited genetic drift that has occurred due to large average effective population sizes that persisted at both locations following their separation. The lack of connectivity among populations suggests that immigrants from west Australia would not facilitate natural recolonization if Philippine populations were fished to extinction. These data help to rectify the paucity of information on the species' biology currently inhibiting their conservation classification. Understanding population structure can allow us to facilitate sustainable harvesting, thereby preserving the diversity of genetically distinct stocks. This article is protected by copyright.

L.; Jennings, S.; Holmes, R.","September 2012","Existing methods to predict the effects of climate change on the biomass and production of marine communities are predicated on modelling the interactions and dynamics of individual species, a very challenging approach when interactions and distributions are changing and little is known about the ecological mechanisms driving the responses of many species. An informative parallel approach is to develop size-based methods. These capture the properties of food webs that describe energy flux and production at a particular size, independent of species’ ecology. We couple a physical–biogeochemical model with a dynamic, size-based food web model to predict the future effects of climate change on fish biomass and production in 11 large regional shelf seas, with and without fishing effects. Changes in potential fish production are shown to most strongly mirror changes in phytoplankton production. We project declines of 30–60% in potential fish production across some important areas of tropical shelf and upwelling seas, most notably in the eastern Indo-Pacific, the northern Humboldt and the North Canary Current. Conversely, in some areas of the high latitude shelf seas, the production of pelagic predators was projected to increase by 28–89%.","Marine","University of Sheffield"
"The geochemistry of environmentally important trace elements in UK coals, with special reference to the Parkgate coal in the Yorkshire-Nottinghamshire Coalfield, UK.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/10358/","Spears, D.A.; Tewalt, S.J.","December 2009","The Parkgate coal of Langsettian age in the Yorkshire-Nottinghamshire coalfield is typical of many coals in the UK in that it has a high sulphur (S) content. Detailed information on the distribution of the forms of S, both laterally and vertically through the seam, was known from previous investigations. In the present work, 38 interval samples from five measured sections of the coal were comprehensively analysed for major, minor and trace elements and the significance of the relationships established using both raw and centered log transformed data. The major elements are used to quantify the variations in the inorganic and organic coal components and determine the trace element associations. Pyrite contains nearly all of the Hg, As, Se, Tl and Pb and is also the major source of the Mo, Ni, Cd and Sb. The clays contain the following elements in decreasing order of association: Rb, Cs, Li, Ga, U, Cr, V, Sc, Y, Bi, Cu, Nb, Sn, Te and Th. Nearly all of the Rb is present in the clay fraction, whereas for elements such as V, Cu and U, a significant amount is thought to be present in the organic matter, based on the K vs trace element regression equations. Only Ge, and possibly Be, would appear to have a dominant organic source. The trace element concentrations are calculated for pyrite, the clay fraction and organic matter. For pyrite it is noted that concentrations agree with published data from the Yorkshire-Nottinghamshire coalfield and also that Tl concentrations (median of 0.33 ppm) in the pyrite are greater than either Hg or Cd. Unlike these elements, Tl has attracted less attention and possibly more information is needed on its anthropogenic distribution and impacts on man and the environment. A seawater source is thought to be responsible for the high concentrations of S, Cl and the non-detrital trace elements in the Parkgate coal. Indicative of the seawater control is the Th/U ratio, which expresses the detrital to non-detrital element contributions. Using other elements, similar ratios can be calculated, which in combination offer greater interpretative value. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Marine","University of Sheffield"

The surrogate consisted of a metal hemicylindrical core, with a diameter of 75 mm, covered with a 15 mm thick relaxed muscle simulant. The muscle simulant consisted of a 14 mm thick layer of silicone covered with 1 mm thick chamois leather to represent skin. The material properties of the silicone were obtained via quasi-static compression testing (curve fit with hyperelastic models) and compressive stress relaxation testing (curve fit with a Prony series). Outputs of the finite element models were compared against experimental data from impact tests on the shoulder surrogate at energies of 4.9, 9.8 and 14.7 J. The accuracy of the finite element models was assessed using four parameters: peak impact force, maximum deformation, impact duration and impulse. A 5-parameter Mooney-Rivlin material model combined with a 2-term Prony series was found to be suitable for modelling the soft tissue simulant of the shoulder surrogate. This model had under 10% overall mean deviation from the experimental values for the four assessment parameters across the three impact energies. Overall, the model provided a repeatable test method that can be adapted to help predict injuries to skin tissue and the performance/efficacy of personal protective equipment.","Ai","University of Sheffield"

While such phenomena have readily been observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, spanning radio to gamma-ray sources, the underlying role of waves in the supply of energy to the outermost extremities of the Sun’s corona has yet to be uncovered. Of particular interest is the lower solar atmosphere, including the photosphere and chromosphere, since these regions harbor the footpoints of powerful magnetic flux bundles that are able to guide oscillatory motion upwards from the solar surface. As a result, many of the current- and next-generation ground-based and space-borne observing facilities are focusing their attention on these tenuous layers of the lower solar atmosphere in an attempt to study, at the highest spatial and temporal scales possible, the mechanisms responsible for the generation, propagation, and ultimate dissipation of energetic wave phenomena. Here, we present a two-fold review that is designed to overview both the wave analyses techniques the solar physics community currently have at their disposal, as well as highlight scientific advancements made over the last decade. Importantly, while many ground-breaking studies will address and answer key problems in solar physics, the cutting-edge nature of their investigations will naturally pose yet more outstanding observational and/or theoretical questions that require subsequent follow-up work. This is not only to be expected, but should be embraced as a reminder of the era of rapid discovery we currently find ourselves in. We will highlight these open questions and suggest ways in which the solar physics community can address these in the years and decades to come.","Ai","University of Sheffield"

This paper aims to highlight the lack of academic discourse surrounding the transition to EVs for rural areas as well as presenting the modelling and results of several potential scenarios for rural EV charging habits. Utilising 7-day travel patterns for a small rural village in the Peak District National Park, UK, this paper investigates the energy requirements and potential recharging patterns should this settlement switch all vehicles to EVs. Two key parameters have been incorporated into the EV charging model; electricity tariffs and charging behaviour based on current battery State of Charge (SoC). The model simulated a 4 week period, from which a time period, with a minimum length of one week, where energy balance could be assured for the whole system was extracted. Results show that instantaneous energy and power requirements can vary drastically depending on electricity tariffs and charging behaviours which could be a major cause for concern for rural grid infrastructure, and for the larger EV transition across the UK.","Ai","University of Sheffield"

In addition, the model was used to investigate the fracture propagation mechanism of two-hole synchronous hydraulic fracturing. The results indicate that the arrangement and spacing of two holes will affect the complexity of hydraulic fractures. The principal stress difference becomes more prominent in the direction of hydraulic fracture propagation with the increase in the principal stress difference.","Ai","University of Sheffield"

The results show that collaborations with secondary (primary) stakeholders are typically associated with the likelihood of developing eco-innovations (product and process innovations) and increased demand for skilled workers. We also find that access to diverse information sources is associated with the likelihood of collaborating with primary stakeholders only.","Ai","University of Sheffield"

How can community-based activities contribute to broader peace processes? What can participatory research methods add to local efforts to build peace? In this book the authors examine these questions through their work with two different Colombian communities who have pursued dialogue amidst ongoing violence, environmental injustice and socio-economic challenges. By reflecting on what people in these contrasting places have achieved through participatory peacebuilding, the authors explore different forms of local agency, the prospects for non-extractive academic engagement, and practical and theoretical lessons for participating in peace in other conflict-affected settings.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
"Heuristic molecular modelling of quasi-isotropic auxetic metamaterials under large deformations.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197918/","da Silva, L.C.M.; Grillanda, N.; Casolo, S.","March 2023","A two-dimensional molecular model is presented for the elastic non-linear modelling and design of meta-materials. The fundamental unit-cell, based on a heuristic molecule (HM) approach, is composed of atoms that interact through centred and non-centred spring-based bonds. The kinematics formulation allows to consider large displacements and finite strains while the specific topology of the HM can be parametrized to modify the shape of the rigid atoms and the size of the bonds. The HM is frame indifferent and provides a remarkable quasi-isotropic elastic response for both deviatoric and volumetric large deformation modes. At a macro-scale, the relationship with different continuum materials is given through a standard isotropic Cauchy up to an isotropic Cosserat solid. Evidence on the interest of the model as a calculation tool is provided by studying the elastic response of standard and auxetic materials subjected to a non-homogeneous deformation field, as well as the response of auxetic foams under large deformations. Aside the numerical agreement, it is highlighted how the tailoring of the HM topology can be effective to approximate the non-linear geometric effects that occur at finer scales of auxetic foams. In perspective, we address how the exotic mechanical properties provided by the HM, together with the assumed physical-driven framework, can foster the engineering application and the design of new meta-materials.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
"A novel data-driven approach to analysis and optimal design of forced periodic operation of chemical reactions.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197831/","Dong, Y.; Lang, Z.-Q.; Zhao, J.","December 2022","Forced periodic operation is a technique that periodically changes the manipulating variable of a chemical reaction system in order to exploit nonlinear dynamics to improve reactant conversion rate. However, the analysis and design of a periodically operated chemical process is a significant challenge. To resolve this problem, recently, nonlinear frequency response (NFR) based methods have been proposed. However, because of the need to derive the NFR from a first principle model, existing NFR methods can only perform qualitative analysis to simple processes and are often difficult to be applied in engineering practice. This article proposes a novel data driven approach to the analysis and optimal design of forced periodic operation of chemical reactions. From the data generated numerically using the first principle model or experimentally from experimental tests, the approach produces a data-driven NFR model that can readily be used for both quantitative study and optimal design of forced periodic operation of any complexities. This can fundamentally address the challenges faced by the existing NFR methods, and provides an effective approach that can potentially be applied in engineering practice. Simulation studies and experimental works are carried out on the application of the new method to an isothermal continuous stirred tank reactor system and a laboratory-scale carbon dioxide absorption process, respectively. The results verify the effectiveness and advantage of the newly proposed data driven approach and demonstrate the potential of the new approach in engineering applications.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
"“So what if ChatGPT wrote it?” Multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI for research, practice and policy.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197691/","Dwivedi, Y.K.; Kshetri, N.; Hughes, L.","March 2023","Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.","Ai","University of Sheffield"

This is conducted by making changes to work policies, practices, and
procedures. Determining what to change and how to make these changes involve several techniques, but best practices focus on participatory processes involving workers, managers, and key stakeholders with a responsibility for managing worker health and wellbeing in the workplace. Despite participation being the recommended method to determine the “what and how” of these changes, there is little consensus about what participation is
and how it works. The evidence of the effectiveness of these participatory processes is unfortunately quite mixed. In this chapter, we discuss these issues and focus on three key
challenges of participation in organizational interventions. First, we discuss issues around different forms of participation, including the advantages and disadvantages of direct and indirect participation and what form of participation may be effective during the different phases of the intervention process. Second, we discuss how participation should work, that is the underlying mechanism for what makes participation facilitate a successful intervention outcome. Third, we discuss how diverse workplaces may challenge traditional ways of conducting organizational interventions.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
"Study of continuous simulation supporting multiple design criteria for sustainable drainage systems.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/196444/","Stovin, V.; Quinn, R.; Rouge, C.","February 2023","Traditional (piped) drainage systems are designed to drain quickly. It is therefore reasonable to design a system assuming that it will be empty at the start of the rainfall event. However, the restoration of full capacity in sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) or low impact development is dependent on slower processes (e.g., evapotranspiration, infiltration, or the consumption of harvested rainwater). Current design guidance often does not advise on reasonable assumptions to make regarding SuDS retention capacity. In addition, SuDS have the capacity to control both runoff volumes and flow rates during both routine and extreme storm events. This presents two further interlinked challenges: first, to identify relevant metrics to define SuDS performance; and, second, to define appropriate performance criteria for system design. Using rainwater harvesting as an example, it is argued that continuous simulation supports the calculation of a full range of performance metrics, properly accounting for retention, and empowering users to set design targets that are appropriate for a desired level of protection. Six independent metrics are considered to characterize performance in response to both routine and extreme rainfall events, and a scatter pie plot is introduced as a clear visual indicator of system performance across multiple targets. While current UK guidance for SuDS prioritizes flood risk mitigation and aims to provide protection up to the 1 in 100 year event, it is argued that such stringent expectations may be acting as a deterrent to SuDS uptake, particularly at the domestic scale. Here, lower design thresholds (for household SuDS) in the region of the 1 in 2 year event and 95% of annual runoff are recommended.","Ai","University of Sheffield"

The evidence regarding the origin and early diversification of land plants combines information from both fossils and living organisms. Extant plants can be utilized in: (1) phylogenetic analyses to provide evidence for the nature of the algal–land plant transition and the characteristics of the most basal land plants; (2) evolutionary developmental biology studies of the characters that enabled the invasion of the land; (3) molecular clock analysis to provide evidence regarding timing of the origin and diversification of land plants. We conclude that the Ordovician was a critical period during the terrestrialization of planet Earth that witnessed the transition from a microbial terrestrial biota to one dominated by a vegetation of the most basal land plants.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
"Integrating feminisms’ perspectives into the legal curriculum: Feminist Perspectives on Health Care Law.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/196225/","Fovargue, S.; Fovargue, S.; Purshouse, C.","January 2023","This chapter discusses Feminist Perspectives on Health Care Law, which was edited by Sally Sheldon and Michael Thomson and published in 1998. It was the first in a series of Routledge-Cavendish collections published predominantly towards the end of the 1990s and the start of the 2000s, which brought together scholars to explore feminist perspectives on specific subjects in the UK law curriculum. The contributors to Feminist Perspectives on
Health Care Law addressed topics which might be expected in any collection on health law - matters relating to consent, autonomy and reproduction, for example – as well as topics which might not immediately be thought of as matters of ‘feminist’ concern – such as the regulation of professions, the ubiquitous Bolam test, or resource allocation. In so doing, they raised readers’ awareness of the importance of considering feminist and other perspectives
and readings of law, and encouraged, challenged, and/or inspired them to undertake such analysis and critique for themselves. They did more than this too. In showing how feminist perspectives could draw attention to how law may operate and affect particular groups in practice (intentionally or otherwise), other disparities and matters of intersectionality were also highlighted.","Ai","University of Sheffield"

AM of nickel superalloys is of great interest for the aerospace sector due to their mechanical performance at increased temperatures. Components were manufactured using the two most common metallic AM processes, laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) and laser directed energy deposition (L-DED). Microstructural and mechanical properties were compared and contrasted between the two processes, showing that despite the processes fundamentally being based on the same physical phenomena, the difference in scale between the processes stops them from being directly comparable. As such, alloy design and processing window development must be performed with a specific application and process in mind.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
"Implementation of inerter-based dynamic vibration absorber for chatter suppression.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/196987/","Dogan, H.; Sims, N.; Wagg, D.","March 2023","Chatter is one of the major issues that cause undesirable effects limiting machining productivity. Passive control devices, such as tuned mass dampers (TMDs), have been widely employed to increase machining stability by suppressing chatter. More recently, inerter-based devices have been developed for a wide variety of engineering vibration mitigation applications. However, no experimental study for the application of inerters to the machining stability problem has yet been conducted. This paper presents an implementation of an inerter-based dynamic vibration absorber (IDVA) to the problem of chatter stability, for the first time. For this, it employs the IDVA with a pivoted-bar inerter developed in [1] to mitigate the chatter effect under cutting forces in milling. Due to the nature of machining stability, the optimal design parameters for the IDVA are numerically obtained by considering the real part of the frequency response function (FRF) which enables the absolute stability limit in a single degree-of-freedom (SDOF) to be maximised for a milling operation. Chatter performance is experimentally validated through milling trials using the prototype IDVA and a flexible workpiece. The experimental results show that the IDVA provides more than 15% improvement in the absolute stability limit compared to a classical TMD.","Ai","University of Sheffield"

Our main contribution is a tube-based coalitional approach that employs online optimized invariant sets. These sets are instrumental in guaranteeing recursive feasibility and stability when faced with plug-and-play operations, i.e., subsystems joining or leaving the network. We also explore the inherent robustness properties to absorb disturbances not covered by the tubes without the need to group local controllers. Finally, the simulation results show the benefits of our proposed control method.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
"Impulsivity and self-regulation: a dual-process model of risky driving in young drivers in Iran.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198984/","Memarian, M.; Lazuras, L.; Rowe, R.","March 2023","The dual-process model of risky driving (Lazuras, Rowe, Poulter, Powell, & Ypsilanti, 2019) suggested that regulatory processes mediate the effect of impulsivity on risky driving. The current study aimed to examine the cross-cultural generalisability of this model to Iranian drivers, who are from a country with a markedly higher rate of traffic collisions. We sampled 458 Iranian drivers aged 18 to 25 using an online survey measuring impulsive processes including impulsivity, normlessness and sensation-seeking, and regulatory processes comprising emotion-regulation, trait self-regulation, driving self-regulation, executive functions, reflective functioning and attitudes toward driving. In addition, we used the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire to measure driving violations and errors. Executive functions and driving self-regulation mediated the effect of attention impulsivity on driving errors. Executive functions, reflective functioning, and driving self-regulation mediated the relationship between motor impulsivity and driving errors. Finally, attitudes toward driving safety significantly mediated the relationship of both normlessness and sensation-seeking with driving violations. These results support the mediatory role of cognitive and self-regulatory capacities in the connection between impulsive processes and driving errors and violations. Overall, the present study confirmed the validity of the dual-process model of risky driving in a sample of young drivers in Iran. Implications for educating drivers and implementing policies and interventions based on this model are discussed.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
"Synchrotron imaging derived relationship between process parameters and build quality for directed energy deposition additively manufactured IN718.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197643/","Notley, S.V.; Chen, Y.; Thacker, N.A.","March 2023","Laser additive manufacturing is transforming several industrial sectors, especially the directed energy deposition process. A key challenge in the widespread uptake of this emerging technology is the formation of undesirable microstructural features such as pores, cracks, and large epitaxial grains. The trial and error approach to establish the relationship between process parameters and material properties is problematic due to the transient nature of the process and the number of parameters involved. In this work, the relationship between process parameters, melt pool geometry and quality of build measures, using directed energy deposition additive manufacturing for IN718, is quantified using neural networks as generalised regressors in a statistically robust manner. The data was acquired using in-situ synchrotron x-ray imaging providing unique and accurate measurements for our analysis. An analysis of the variations across repeated measurements show heteroscedastic error characteristics that are accounted for using a principled nonlinear data transformation method. The results of the analysis show that surface roughness correlates with melt pool geometry while the track height directly correlates with process parameters indicating a potential to directly control efficiency and layer thickness while independently minimising surface roughness.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
"Implementation relations and testing for cyclic systems: adding probabilities.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197992/","Núñez, M.; Hierons, R.; Lefticaru, R.","April 2023","This paper concerns the systematic testing of robotic control software based on state-based models. We focus on cyclic systems that typically receive inputs (values from sensors), perform computations, produce outputs (sent to actuators) and possibly change state. We provide a testing theory for such cyclic systems where time can be represented and probabilities are used to quantify non-deterministic choices, making it possible to model probabilistic algorithms. In addition, refusals, the inability of a system to perform a set of actions, are taken into account. We consider several possible testing scenarios. For example, a tester might only be able to passively observe a sequence of events and so cannot check probabilities, while in another scenario a tester might be able to repeatedly apply a test case and so estimate the probabilities of sequences of events. These different testing scenarios lead to a range of implementation relations (notions of correctness). As a consequence, this paper provides formal definitions of implementation relations that can form the basis of sound automated testing in a range of testing scenarios. We also validate the implementation relations by showing how observers can be used to provide an alternative but equivalent characterisation.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
"Bayesian nonparametric mixtures of Exponential Random Graph Models for ensembles of networks.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197903/","Ren, S.; Wang, X.; Liu, P.","March 2023","Ensembles of networks arise in various fields where multiple independent networks are observed, for example, a collection of student networks from different classes. However, there are few models that describe both the variations and characteristics of networks in an ensemble at the same time. In this manuscript, we propose to model ensembles of networks using a Dirichlet Process Mixture of Exponential Random Graph Models (DPM-ERGMs), which divides an ensemble into different clusters and models each cluster of networks using a separate Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM). By employing a Dirichlet process mixture, the number of clusters can be determined automatically and changed adaptively with the data provided. Moreover, in order to perform full Bayesian inference for DPM-ERGMs, we develop a Metropolis-within-slice sampling algorithm to address the problem of sampling from the intractable ERGMs on an infinite sample space. We also demonstrate the performance of DPM-ERGMs with both simulated and real datasets.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
"Serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1: a potential target for neuroprotection and other diseases.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/196684/","Sandoval-Castellanos, A.; Bhargava, A.; Zhao, M.","September 2022","Alternative splicing is the process of producing variably spliced mRNAs by choosing distinct combinations of splice sites within a messenger RNA precursor. This splicing enables mRNA from a single gene to synthesize different proteins, which have different cellular properties and functions and yet arise from the same single gene. A family of splicing factors, Serine-arginine rich proteins, are needed to initiate the assembly and activation of the spliceosome. Serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1, part of the arginine/serine-rich splicing factor protein family, can either activate or inhibit the splicing of mRNAs, depending on the phosphorylation status of the protein and its interaction partners. Considering that serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 is either an activator or an inhibitor, this protein has been studied widely to identify its various roles in different diseases. Research has found that serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 is a key target for neuroprotection, showing its promising potential use in therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 might be used to regulate cancer development and autoimmune diseases. In this review, we highlight how serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 has been studied concerning neuroprotection. In addition, we draw attention to how serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 is being studied in cancer and immunological disorders, as well as how serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 acts outside the central or peripheral nervous system.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
"On the power of the conditional likelihood ratio and related tests for weak-instrument robust inference.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/183334/","Van de Sijpe, N.; Windmeijer, F.","February 2022","Power curves of the Conditional Likelihood Ratio (CLR) and related tests for testing H0:β = β0 in linear models with a single endogenous variable, y = xβ+u, estimated using potentially weak instrumental variables have been presented for two different designs. One design keeps the variance matrix of the structural and first-stage errors, Σ, constant, the other instead keeps the variance matrix of the reduced-form and first-stage errors, Ω, constant. The values of Σ govern the endogeneity features of the model. The fixed-Ω design changes these endogeneity features with changing values of β in a way that makes it less suitable for an analysis of the behaviour of the tests in low to moderate endogeneity settings, or when β and the correlation of the structural and first-stage errors, ρuv, have the same sign. At larger  values of |β|, the fixed-Ω design implicitly selects values for Σ where the power of the CLR test is high. We show that the Likelihood Ratio statistic is identical to the t0(βb L) 2 statistic as proposed by Mills, Moreira, and Vilela (2014), where βb L is the LIML estimator. In fixed-Σ design Monte Carlo simulations, we find that LIMLand Fuller-based conditional Wald tests and the Fuller-based conditional t 20 test are more powerful than the CLR test when the degree of endogeneity is low to moderate. The conditional Wald tests are further the most powerful of these tests when β and ρuv have the same sign. We show that in the fixed-Ω design, setting β0 = 0 and the diagonal elements of Ω equal to 1 is not without loss of generality, unlike in the fixed-Σ design.","Ai","University of Sheffield"

The standard Hill–Mandel Principle, based on spatial averages, is extended with time averaging. Thus, in addition to a sufficiently large Representative Volume Element (RVE) to carry out the averaging in space, a sufficiently large time window is required to carry out the time averaging. The space–time averaging procedure is validated for a periodic laminate bar subjected to a variety of boundary conditions, impedance contrasts and loading conditions. The homogenised results converge to the analytical solutions and confirm that having a higher impedance contrast between laminate components requires not only larger RVE sizes but also longer time averaging windows. The most efficient macroscopic approximation is obtained by a balanced increase in RVE size and time averaging window.","Ai","University of Sheffield"

This is accomplished by conducting controlled experiments and validated Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations for a broad collection of spheroidal particle shapes at vibration amplitudes of up to 50 g. The findings show that non-spherical particles significantly change the condition known as the “bouncing bed onset amplitude” which is the vibration amplitude at which granular damping is maximised. It is shown that the packing parameter known as the coordination number is an indicator of this change and that there is a correlation between the shear properties of the granular medium and the amplitude at which it delivers optimum energy dissipation. This paper also presents a sensitivity analysis specific to the bouncing bed phase which considers variations in particle modulus, density, restitution coefficient and friction. This shows that the observations about the effects of particle shape are valid over a broad range of conditions.","Ai","University of Sheffield"
