"The pursuit of indigenous innovation amid the Tech Cold War: The case of a Chinese high-tech firm","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/The-pursuit-of-indigenous-innovation-amid/99704166502346?institution=44SUR_INST","Shasha Zhao","19/11/2022","For emerging market firms (EMFs) internationalisation is as an important channel through which knowledge is gained and innovation capabilities acquired. However, rising global un-certainty and geopolitical tension make this increasingly challenging. We employed an in-depth case study approach to examine how a Chinese high-tech firm pursued innovation dur-ing the Tech Cold War. We found that the firm focused on pursuing indigenous innovation. Three organisational cultural attributes (patriotism, elitism and endurance of hardship) proved to be particularly important enabling mechanisms. We extend theorisation on EMF innovation management – particularly catching up through internationalisation – by identifying the ever more advanced capabilities that provide the basis for increased pursuit of indigenous innova-tion by EMFs. We further contribute to research on techno-nationalism by examining how techno-nationalist policies affect EMF innovation and how firms cope with such restrictions. More generally, our findings advance the emerging field of studies on geopolitics in EMF in-novation by highlighting the ever more critical role of international politics and state policies.

The STRaND-1 mission described in this paper is used to demonstrate the hurdles which must be overcome in order to create cost-effective CubeSat platforms that are ready for operational missions with satisfactory design lifetime, reliability and availability objectives. STRaND-1 is the UK’s first CubeSat, and will be launched on the 25th of February 2013 on a PSLV into a dawn-dusk sun-synchronous orbit. As with many CubeSats, the goals of the successful 3U mission were rapid training and technology demonstration. The novelty (other than the technical novelty of testing the robustness of mobile phone electronics in the LEO environment) was the volunteer nature of the team, and that the organisations involved had previous operational small satellite mission experience. This paper takes a holistic view of the mission, critically reviewing the mission lifecycle from the initial concept design through to integration and testing, LEOP and initial mission results in respect of these hurdles to operational applications. The UK's small satellite technology demonstration mission - TDS-1 - is presented for contrast. Now ready for flight in Q3 2013, TDS-1 is an example of how a collaborative small sat technology demonstration mission can be accomplished at low cost and inside a rapid schedule. TDS-1 incorporates a suite of eight separate sensor payloads plus a novel set of advanced avionics. The design, concept of operations and management of TDS-1 enabled the platform enough flexibility to accommodate the payloads to change in both number and in bus resources required throughout the programme lifecycle, while avoiding the pitfalls of over-designing the system. The review is conducted with an eye to how a CubeSat mission differs from the commercial, small satellite approach to spacecraft engineering. In particular, lessons learnt on CubeSat general system design philosophy, data bus topologies, and management philosophies are discussed and compared against the more traditional small sat approach, something on which the Surrey community can speak with authority. Conclusions are drawn on the the similarities and differences of the small-satellite approach pioneered in the 1990s and the CubeSat approach pioneered in the 2000s, with recommendations on where commercial, small satellite engineering philosophy can be applied to the hypothetical operational CubeSat mission, and vice versa.","Tech","University of Surrey"

Through the lens of psychosocial identity, qualitative data analysis from interviews with current and previous fishers in Cornwall shows how people are deconstructing and reconstructing their identities in the transition from fishing to tourism work, and that experiences of marine tourism diversification are dynamic, multifaceted, and embedded in social encounters. This article expands current discussions on work transitions by giving insight into the lived experiences of marine tourism operators from a psychosocial perspective, to go beyond the dominant economic narrative of diversification and social change, which has implications on how transitions into tourism work are facilitated.","Marine","University of Surrey"

Abate; Tobias Borger; Margrethe Aanesen; Jannike Falk-Andersson; Kayleigh Wyles; Nicola Beaumont","03/2020","Despite its remoteness, marine plastic pollution is a significant environmental problem in the Arctic. In Svalbard, for example, plastics are found on the shorelines, in the water column, on the ocean floor and in the ice. Organisms have been observed to be entangled in nets and ingestion of plastics has been documented in a range of organisms. Notably almost all Arctic bird species have been found to have ingested plastic, with Northern fulmars being particularly affected, with 89% of samples recorded as having ingested plastic. Identification and valuation of ecosystem services affected by marine plastic pollution can provide input for decision makers in evaluating and comparing management policies concerning this unique environment. This study employs the contingent valuation method (CVM) for eliciting the willingness to pay (WTP) of Norwegian households for reducing marine plastic pollution around the archipelago of Svalbard. An Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model (ICLV) is employed to explore attitudinal determinants of WTP. We find an average WTP for an initiative to reduce marine plastics of NOK 5,485 (USD 642) per household per year. The ICLV results reveal that people who are relatively more concerned about marine plastic pollution and who deem the proposed initiative effective are willing to pay more (up to 85 % and 50 %, respectively). The use of ICLV models in CVM and recommendations for future research are discussed.","Marine","University of Surrey"

The issue of marine plastic litter was raised during the inaugural meeting of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) in June 2014. Delegates from 160 countries adopted Resolution 1/6 on ‘Marine plastic debris and microplastics’ (Annex I). The resolution welcomed the work being undertaken by GESAMP on microplastics and requested the Executive Director of UNEP to carry out a study on marine plastics and microplastics. This was to be based on a combination of existing and new studies, including WG40.

An ecosystem impact analysis demonstrates that there is global evidence of impact with medium to high frequency on all subjects, with a medium to high degree of irreversibility. A novel translation of these ecological impacts into ecosystem service impacts provides evidence that all ecosystem services are impacted to some extent by the presence of marine plastic, with a reduction in provision predicted for all except one. This reduction in ecosystem service provision is evidenced to have implications for human health and wellbeing, linked particularly to fisheries, heritage and charismatic species, and recreation.","Marine","University of Surrey"

Found throughout the oceans, from the poles to the equator and from the shoreline to the deep sea, impacts of this debris on the environment and wildlife is well recorded. For example, rubbish items can have lethal and sub-­‐‑lethal effects on marine dwelling organisms, through processes such as ingestion, entanglement, and chemical contamination from eating those materials (Gall and Thompson, 2015). Whilst the research examining the distribution, abundance, and impacts of litter on the environment and its inhabitants is ever growing, it is important to recognise the human dimension of this problem. Humans are unquestionably the source of the problem; optimistically, we are also the solution, but an often overlooked aspect is that we too are also impacted by marine litter. Here, this short article will briefly overview the impact litter has on individuals, the psychological value of doing something about it, and why this is important when trying to address this global and growing issue.","Marine","University of Surrey"

While some users appear to have adopted this language and terminology, there are concerns that the complexities associated with the concept make it inaccessible and, rather than providing stakeholders with a tool to explain complex relationships, the language and terminology itself may disengage. Through surveying UKbased coastal and marine stakeholders (n=158), this study examines stakeholders’ perceptions of the concept of ecosystem services and its role and usefulness within the marine and coastal science-policy-practice interface. Overall, stakeholders provided favourable opinions, with findings similar across respondents with the exception of industry; which used it less, was less confident with it and believed it to be less important. The results provide an evidenced argument for the benefits of the ecosystem services approach, including communication, supporting management and linking environment to humans. The analysis also details the required advancements to ensure effective future use, including improved terminology, pluralistic valuation and shared learning. Finally, the paper highlights challenges and benefits relating to the term, creating links to ongoing discussions about effective scientific communication for marine and coastal management.","Marine","University of Surrey"
"Hunting for aquatic bladder carcinogens","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Hunting-for-aquatic-bladder-carcinogens/99595021402346?institution=44SUR_INST","MARINE  DIANA","30/09/2021","Epidemiological studies have consistently found an association between the consumption of chlorinated water and an increased risk of developing bladder cancer. This risk has been attributed to disinfection byproducts (DBPs) – undesirable products formed during the disinfection of drinking water – but the individual compounds responsible remain unknown. This project aims at assessing which individual or groups of DBPs may be implicated in the bladder cancer association. By comparing the structures of bladder carcinogens and probable DBPs in a review of the literature (published in Water Research), halocyclopentenoic acids, halofuranones and haloquinones were selected as potentially critical DBP candidates. Eleven phenolic compounds previously used as surrogates for natural organic matter in drinking water were chlorinated under 91 different conditions (different precursors, pH, chlorine and bromide doses). UV spectroscopy was used as a screening method to identify which conditions lead to the formation of stable UV-absorbing DBPs. Ten chlorinated samples were prioritised, in which 3 chlorophenols and bromoform were tentatively identified by GC-MS. Using HPLC-HRMS, the chemical formulas of 55 DBPs were elucidated and possible products were proposed for 44 of them. 31 of these were never reported before as DBPs. A novel pathway was proposed for the formation of 15 out of a total of 35 furan-like products tentatively identified using HPLC-HRMS. It consists of the opening of the oxidised phenolic ring followed by the formation of a 5-membered ring by intramolecular nucleophilic addition. These results indicate 
6 
that the formation of furan-like DBPs may be far more widespread in drinking water than previously appreciated. Among the mechanistically plausible DBPs tentatively identified, 11 were predicted to be bladder carcinogens using a quantitative structure-toxicity relationship theoretical model. Prioritising critical DBPs will enable future research to assess their occurrence, confirm their toxicity and control their concentration in drinking water, ultimately reducing the bladder cancer risk.","Marine","University of Surrey"

Barrett","1989","Marine fouling development upon stainless steel and elastomeric surfaces was studied by light and electron microscopy and the observed contributions of the various organisms involved is discussed. As an extension of the above, the bacteriology of a mature fouling film from stainless steel was examined. Characterized isolates were classified by numerical taxonomy. Species of Vibrio dominated the isolatable aerobic heterotrophic bacterial community. A number of previously undescribed species were discovered, highlighting inadequacies of current identification schemes. Isolate characteristics are discussed in relation to conditions during fouling development. Immuno- location of species within TEM sections of fouling was attempted without success. Macromolecular dissolved organic materials were isolated from seawater by ultrafiltration, and characterization showed these materials to be humic substances, predominantly fulvic acid. Concentrated solutions of these materials were used to organically pretreat stainless steel surfaces prior to marine immersion, and the fouling of these and clean surfaces was compared. It was discovered that preadsorbed material can influence both the in vivo attachment and growth of microorganisms and subsequent fouling succession. Natural molecular fouling was also studied in relation to bacterial attachment. In vitro assessment of the attachment of a marine Vibrio Sp. to pretreated and clean stainless steel after prior growth in the presence of different concentrations of different macromolecular species revealed a relationship between growth regime and adhesive tendancy. The effect of humic materials on the growth of selected bacteria was investigated in vitro. Some isolates grew with these materials acting as sole sources of carbon, nitrogen and energy. Bacterial growth on acetate was stimulated by humic materials at specific concentrations, although inhibitory effects were apparent if concentrations of the latter were increased further. The growth physiology of marine bacteria in the. presence of humic substances and the possible role of humic substances in fouling community development is discussed.","Marine","University of Surrey"

Saunders-Davies","1999","The rotifer populations of the algae of a large marine lagoon (the Fleet, which lies behind Chesil Beach, Dorset, England) were assessed from 1993 to 1998. Physical and chemical parameters were measured at different sites, including water and air temperatures, pH, and the ions NH4+, NO3-, PO43- and SiO44-. Significant differences were found between species, species richness and total abundances with both spatial and temporal variations. Granularity of some sites was measured. A new method of assessing water disturbance is described, using the loss of dye across a low-permeability membrane. An inverse correlation was found between on one hand species richness and total abundances, and on the other salinity. Some possible reasons for the distribution found include salinity, temperature, and the relationships between the morphology of the algae present and the rotifers’ behaviour and preferred habitat, with particular respect to the foot of Testudinella clypeata. Significantly larger populations of Proales reinhardti were found in the littoral pools containing mainly phaeophyte algae, than in those containing mainly chlorophyte algae. Laboratory experiments showed that sustained high temperatures are the probable cause of the populations of P. reinhardti in the littoral pools falling in late Spring. The identification and taxonomy of the species found are discussed. A new species - Proales fleetensis nov. sp. is described. This thesis also presents some approaches to overcoming the difficulties of quantitative sampling of littoral rotifers.","Marine","University of Surrey"

Edwards","1982","Humic materials, which have been implicated in a number of adsorption processes in the marine environment, were isolated from seawater using three extraction procedures (adsorption onto XAD-2 resin, ultrafiltration and chloroform-emulsion extraction). XAD extraction appeared to be best suited to the isolation of fulvic acids whilst high molecular weight components were best extracted using ultrafiltration. The chloroform-emulsion technique may be used to extract the surface-active humic materials. These extracts were shown to be capable of adsorbing to hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates and more detailed adsorption characteristics (adsorption isotherms; effect of pH, ionic strength, temperature and surface area on adsorption) were determined using silver iodide powder as the adsorbent. These adsorption studies reflected the polydisperse and polyelectrolyte nature of the extracts. The use of silver iodide allowed the infrared examination of adsorbed materials from these experiments and a comparison with an adsorbed film formed from unfractionated seawater was made. Contact angle data showed that hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates remained or became hydrophilic after adsorption of some of the extracts on their surfaces. These adsorbed layers were shown to inhibit the attachment of a marine pseudomonad (NCMB 2021), as shown for a clean hydrophilic substrate and this was in marked contrast to high numbers of attached organisms on a clean hydrophobic substrate. It is suggested that the major components of adsorbed ""conditioning"" films formed in vivo are humic acids with fulvic acids and lipids being minor components. It is further suggested that adsorbed materials may not play an active role in bacterial attachment, it may simply be that macromolecule adsorption precedes it in nature.","Marine","University of Surrey"

Isnardi-Bruno","2002","Rising coastal populations in Europe and the rest of the World together with the continuing growth in recreational water activities increase the level of hazard within some of these communities, and therefore potential risk to bathers. High levels of concern have lead to attempts to address more successfully the actual risks posed by the discharge of pathogens into the marine environment. The potential of certain bacteria and bacteriophage groups to act as indicators of enterovirus within sewage treatment plant and following discharge into the marine environment was assessed over 28 months. Comparative analyses were carried out against enterovirus on a real-time basis with six indicator species sampled at two long sea outfalls on the South coast. Five hundred seawater and 70 wastewater samples were taken on 35 separate sampling trips, and the movement of wastewater discharge plumes mapped using drogues under widely varying environmental conditions. Results identified no significant relationships between bacteria, bacteriophage populations, or enterovirus after discharge to the environment and question the ability of any single organism to act as a universal indicator of enterovirus. Unexpectedly low numbers of virus were detected at sea, based on known ratios in wastewater. Works effluent sampling did highlight some relationships between the six indicating organisms and enterovirus, but all phage indicator groups displayed significant shortcomings, invalidating them as indicators. The adoption of phage standards, therefore, is unlikely to provide any significant benefit to risk management or public health protection. Utilising the environmental data, an alternative approach to risk assessment was developed which utilises real time environmental information to predict the future condition of bathing waters allowing significant improvements in predictive accuracy on a stand-alone basis to be made on impending pollution incidents. Preliminary testing of the model shows that predicted indicator numbers closely match the results of this study.","Marine","University of Surrey"

This study was undertaken to investigate the regulation and function of SeGPX, in M. edulis and also in the scallop Pecten maxim us , the starfish Asterias rubens and the shore crab Carcinus maenas. Sources of pro-oxidant stress include changing oxygen tension and dietary chemicals. The four species were chosen as representing three major invertebrate phyla and different nutritional and respiratory strategies M. edulis (euryoxic, herbivore, Mollusca), P. maximus (stenoxic, herbivore, Mollusca), C. maenas (euryoxic, omnivore, Arthropoda), and A. rubens (stenoxic, carnivore, Echinodermata). Determination of the tissue distribution of SeGPX, total GPX, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase and DT-diaphorase activities was carried out in the four marine invertebrates, with comparison to endogenous potential for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the tissues studied. SeGPX enzyme levels were also compared to the putative SeGPX mRNA signal, determined by slot blotting and probing with the human SeGPX gene. Overall, there was a trend for greatest enzyme activity and ROS production potential in the digestive tissues, followed by the respiratory tissues. Comparison to endogenous ROS production potentials indicated that factors such as diet, respiratory strategy and motility were influential in determining the levels of antioxidant enzymes present in each species. Further optimisation of nucleic acid detection resulted in the demonstration of a single copy SeGPX gene in M. edulis genomic DNA and a single SeGPX mRNA species of approximately 1. 2 Kilobases in length in the digestive gland, in agreement with other known SeGPX mRNAs. Western blotting using an antihuman SeGPX polyclonal antibody, detected a 23KDa protein in M. edulis digestive gland. These methods and activity assays for SeGPX and total GPX were then used to investigate the seasonal regulation of SeGPX in M. edulis , the results indicating regulation of SeGPX at the mRNA level, possibly in relation to temperature, reproductive cycle and diet. Total GPX activity mirrored neither SeGPX protein nor SeGPX mRNA levels, indicating the involvement of other enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases in catalysing GPX activity with organic peroxides. Dietary effects on SeGPX and antioxidant enzymes were investigated by starving M. edulis, A. rubens and C. maenas, for prolonged periods of up to 10 weeks. Differences in induction and repression of antioxidant enzymes were indicated in the three species, SOD activity decreasing possibly due to reduced cellular O2- levels, in all species except A. rubens. Catalase and SeGPX activity in M. edulis and C. maenas showed clear signs of induction after 5 weeks starvation, possibly to counteract increased protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation. Finally, water-borne heavy metal ions, Cu2+ Hg2+ and CH3Hg+, known perturbers of glutathione metabolism in the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, were used to study changes in the mRNA, protein and activity levels of SeGPX. Results showed increased mRNA levels for SeGPX in the gill of M. galloprovincialis in response to exposure to 40μg/l Hg2+, possibly indicating an induction response to either ROS mediated damage, or decreased levels of functional SeGPX. SeGPX protein levels often mirrored the changes in mRNA levels. However only in the case of Cu2+ exposure did enzyme activity show corresponding changes with SeGPX mRNA and protein. Levels of SeGPX were seen to return to normal levels for Cu2+ and CH3Hg+ exposure Overall, a single gene and mRNA species have been indicated for M. edulis SeGPX, a similar mRNA also being present in the major tissues of three other marine invertebrates. The SeGPX mRNA levels in M. edulis appear to respond to a number of endogenous and exogenous stimuli, including seasonal regulation, starvation and heavy metal toxicity-induced ROS mediated stress. Control of SeGPX enzyme levels therefore appears to be exerted at the level of SeGPX mRNA transcription or stabilisation.","Marine","University of Surrey"
"Development of Primary Cell Culture Systems From Marine Invertebrates For Use in Toxicology.","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Development-of-Primary-Cell-Culture-Systems/99515184002346?institution=44SUR_INST","Claudia. Birmelin","1998","Primary cell cultures of the major bio transformation organ in two species of aquatic invertebrate from different phyla, i. e. principally the digestive gland of the marine mussel Mytilus edulis (Mollusca) and also the hepatopancreas of the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Arthropoda), as well as M. edulis gill, were developed and investigated for potential use in toxicological studies. Suspension cultures of M. edulis digestive gland cells contained a mixture of smaller cell types (basophilic cells, duct epithelial cells, crypt or undifferentiated cells, blood cells and lipid-rich cells) and large lysosomal digestive cells. Smaller cell types survived at a viability of over 50% after 2 weeks in culture whereas the more fragile digestive cells deteriorated rapidly (viability below 50% after 2 days). No cell proliferation was observed. Analysis of DNA integrity in freshly isolated M. edulis digestive gland cells using the single cell electrophoresis ('comet') assay revealed that trypsin caused significant DNA strand breakage, indicating that the use of trypsin in tissue dissociation procedures should be avoided. Freshly isolated M. edulis digestive gland cells had similar or slightly lower biotransformation enzyme (benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase[BPH], glutathione S-transferase [GST] and NADH-DT diaphorase [DTD]) and antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase) activities than comparable subcellular fractions of whole tissue. A time-course study in M. edulis digestive gland cells cultured for 4 days revealed changes in enzyme activities possibly indicative of differential cell survival, i. e. biotransformation enzyme (GST, DTD and cytochrome P450-dependent BPH) activities decreased more rapidly over time than antioxidant enzyme (SOD and catalase) activities. This may be due to the capacity for xenobiotic metabolism being primarily located in the large digestive cells compared to antioxidant functions being found in all cell types. Exposure of M. edulis digestive gland cells to benzo[a]pyrene resulted in elevated protein levels in Western blot analysis using anti-fish CYP1A and hsp70 antibodies, but identification of the former was not possible due to the low specificity of the CYP1A antibodies employed. In an attempt to apply the primary cell culture in a novel approach to biomonitoring, a comparison of two field populations of M. edulis using radiolabelled digestive gland cells was undertaken using 2-D gel electrophoresis. Digestive gland cells from a polluted site showed significant elevations of at least 10 newly synthesized proteins of 30-57 kDa molecular weight. Finally, in order to compare tissue- and species-specific differences, cell dissociation techniques for M. edulis digestive gland cells were applied to M. edulis gill cells and P. clarkii hepatopancreas cells and the toxic action of the organophosphate pesticide fenitrothion via metabolism to fenitroxon was investigated. Enzyme activities studied were acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxyl esterase (CbE), BPH and GST in M. edulis cells, and AChE, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and GST in P. clarkii cells. In all three primary cell cultures, the same pattern of enzyme modulation became apparent with esterase activities (AChE, CbE) being inhibited, and GST activity slightly elevated upon exposure to fenitrothion. M. edulis and P. clarkii cells metabolized fenitrothion to its toxic metabolite, fentrooxon, and a second metabolite, 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol was detected in P. clarkii cells but not in M. edulis cells. The use of CYP-inhibitors indicated that CYP plays a major role in the metabolism of fenitrothion but that different CYP isoforms may be involved in M. edulis compared to P. clarkii. . Overall, it was demonstrated that primary cell cultures from M. edulis digestive gland and P. clarkii hepatopancreas contain cell types, enzyme and metabolic characteristics similar to intact tissues, and that short-term studies using these cell cultures can make a significant contribution to understanding xenobiotic metabolism and cellular toxicity in sentinel species. This may aid the interpretation of ecotoxicological and biomonitoring studies.","Marine","University of Surrey"

Irvine","2000","Obesity and diabetes are common in dogs, which in human studies have been linked to derangements in insulin sensitivity and macronutrient metabolism. However, unlike human based research, insulin resistance and its consequences have not been extensively studied in the dog. It was therefore the aim of this thesis to establish a suitable method to measure insulin sensitivity in dogs and to investigate the effect of marine fish oil (MFO) supplementation. The glucose/insulin minimal model used to analyse data from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IvGTT) was constructed from published literature and validated using data from the literature and other groups. To test reproducibility in vivo, three dogs were investigated six times using the IvGTT with model analysis. All dogs showed mean values for insulin sensitivity (S1) of 1.05, 0.75 and 0.76 x104 min-1pM-1, and glucose effectiveness (S G) of 3.32, 2.27 and 2.93 x102 min-1. Mean intraindividual coefficients of variation of 16% (S1) and 46 % (SG) were found. Measures of insulin sensitivity as assessed by the oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (OGTT and IvGTT) and the insulin tolerance test (ITT) were each made once in five dogs. The OGTT was considered unsuitable due to rises in plasma glucose late in the test, which were possibly a result of the glucose dose used. Of the other tests the IvGTT appeared more sensitive as the ITT classified a possibly insulin insensitive dog as the most insulin sensitive of the group (IvGTT S1 = 0.53 x 104 min-1pM-1 (range 0.53-2.76), ITT k3-15 = 8.15%/min (range 6.40-8.15)). To assess the effect of MFO supplementation, 6 dogs were compared with MFO enriched and unenriched diets. Intakes of 0.08g EPA and 0.06g DHA per 100g food resulted in high levels of incorporation in red blood cell membranes. Testing with an IvGTT at the end of each diet found no observed effects on insulin sensitivity in the group as a whole. However one dog with a reduced insulin sensitivity (0.53 x104 min-1pM-1) did show an improvement with MFO supplementation (0.94 x 104 min-1pM-1). In conclusion, insulin sensitivity in the dog can be reliably assessed by a number of measures but the best of these appears to be the IvGTT with minimal model analysis. Dietary manipulation to increase intake of MFO does not appear to improve insulin sensitivity in normal dogs. Further studies might focus on dogs with known insulin resistance or those with risk factors for resistance such as age, breed and body composition.","Marine","University of Surrey"

To ensure the sustainability of this environment, we require an integrated understanding of the activities taking place in coastal environments that takes into account the benefits to human visitors but also the risks to the environment. This paper presents two studies on the perceived risks and benefits associated with recreational visits to rocky shores in the UK and internationally. Marine experts and recreational users of the coast responded to questionnaires that explored the marine awareness and wellbeing effects of different activities on the visitor and, in turn, the perceived harmfulness of these activities to the environment. Two studies found that a visit to a rocky shore was seen to improve visitors' awareness regarding the marine environment as well as their wellbeing (with some activities being calming such as sunbathing and relaxing, and others exciting such as rock pooling). However, this was perceived to be at a cost to the environment, as some activities were noted to have detrimental effects on the habitat. Marine experts and coastal users gave very similar answers, as did British (Study 1) and international respondents (Study 2). Using an integrative approach, the perceived impacts on both the environment and visitor were then explored together. Walking and rock pooling were seen to provide considerable wellbeing benefits but had high negative impacts on the environment. In contrast, resource focussed activities such as fishing, bait collecting and crabbing were perceived as less important for visitor wellbeing yet also had negative environmental impacts. Using this integrative approach, this analysis begins to suggest priorities for management that benefits both the environment and the recreational users.","Marine","University of Surrey"

Olive","1982","The aim of this study was to contribute to the knowledge of Total Systems theory and methodologies, by developing an aid to decision making on the effectiveness of complex man-machine organisations. Sponsored by the Ministry of Defence (Navy) as a collaborative research project, the study was to be based on Royal Navy ships and also linked with certain MOD(N) projects working on related effectiveness problems. Initial pre-feasibility, then feasibility studies established a simple model of Effectiveness as the combination of Availability, Performance and Human Factors, which was followed by a more thorough examination of the Availability Function. The development of an Information System designed for the collection and analysis of reliability and maintainability data was central to this phase of the research. This culminates in a comprehensive description of the Phase I hardware, software requirements and information distribution network to be installed and operating commencing in 1983. The Human Factors research was linked to two additional Ministry of Defence (Navy) projects who made available the Human Factors data. This data, collected from five ships of the Type 42 Guided Weapons Destroyer Class, was concerned with the Operations Room organization. Using this data base, a subjective analysis resulted in key indicators being produced which were used with a rating scale technique to develop profiles. Following a systemic overview three interactive indicators - Variable Disjunction of Information, Knowledge and Information Processing were used as the basis of an Information Transfer Function conceptual model. This model, when combined with Systems Interaction Diagrams enabled a Methodology to be designed which was evaluated against a three man-function element within a total Operations Room complement of 33 men. On the premise that the Human Factors function could be transformed to metric data the framework of a Human Factors model was developed, based on an existing Total Ship Availability Model with the potential that these could be combined to produce an Effectiveness model. The information System, the proposed Methodology and the framework of a Ship Effectiveness Model were then incrementally and theoretically linked in order to develop the organisation of a decision making aid for evaluating the effectiveness of complex man-machine systens. The research was not intended to test or validate the decision making aid, as aspects of this will need to be approved by Ministry of Defence (Navy) authorities before proceeding to the next phase of implementing the results so far produced.","Navy","University of Surrey"

As outlined in the Acknowledgement section, this research work was funded by two separate bodies, the U.S. Navy and the Ministry of Defence. The first year's work was initally intended to be solely a single year's research post and the U.S. Navy funding provided was only ever intended to be sufficient for that time. However, after several months into the research programme, the opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. was facilitated by the attainment of a generous S.E.R.C./M.o.D. grant. The materials synthesized and characterized in the two volumes are closely related and find use in similar fields of application. In particular the allyl-functionalized derivative of Bisphenol-A, 2,2'-bis(3-allyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)isopropylidene figures particularly strongly in both areas of the research as both a parent compound for a number of Surface acoustic wave (SAW) vapour sensor coatings, and also as the parent compound for several potential matrix resins in the second section of the research. The two funding bodies are quite discrete from one another and during the course of the preparation of this thesis large portions of manuscript were edited by supervisors/consultants from both establishments. In the interests of discretion it was decided at a very early stage to divide the thesis into two, thus enabling each volume to be safely submitted for discussion without fear of causing any offence to either funding body.","Navy","University of Surrey"

An airborne relay in ground/maritime space can effectively connect to units operating over the horizon, beyond normal communication range, or under limited satellite communication environments. For efficient UAV communication relay, this paper firstly deals with the UAV deployment for stationary communication nodes, which finds the fixed optimal location of UAVs to improve the connectivity of a wireless network. Then, considering movements of vessels and constraints of the fixed-wing UAV in a dynamic environment, this paper proposes a decentralised nonlinear model predictive trajectory planning strategy. By exploiting motion estimates of vessels and states of UAVs, the trajectory planning algorithm finds a control input sequence over a certain time horizon, which optimises network connectivity. Numerical simulations are performed with different number of UAVs for both stationary and manoeuvring naval vessels to verify the feasibility and benefit of the proposed approach. © IFAC.","Navy","University of Surrey"

Moreira","15/02/2021","Meteorological data collected using ocean buoys are very important for weather forecasting. In addition, they provide valuable information on ocean–atmosphere interaction processes that have not yet been explored. Accordingly, data collection using ocean buoys is well established around the world. In Brazil, ocean buoy data are obtained by the Brazilian Navy through a monitoring network on the Brazilian coast, which has high potential for wind power generation. In this context, the present study aimed to analyze the scaling behavior of wind speed on the Brazilian coast (continental shelf), South Atlantic Ocean and coast of Africa in order to determine long-range correlations and acquire more information on the crossover phenomenon at various scales. For this purpose, the detrended fluctuation analysis technique and numerical simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale model were used. The results from buoys show that wind speed exhibits a scaling behavior, but without the crossover phenomenon in the Brazilian coast, South Atlantic Ocean and coast of Africa, indicating the dependence of the phenomenon by the terrestrial surface, suggesting influence on the wind power generation. Buoy data from the South Atlantic Ocean and coast Africa showed a subdiffusive behavior (α≥1), whereas those from the Brazilian coast indicated persistence (0.5<α<1), except for the confluence region of Porto Seguro, which indicated anti-persistence (α=0.48). The numerical simulations using the WRF mesoscale model showed a subdiffusive behavior on the Brazilian coast, and no persistence was reproduced in most coastal buoys. The findings support deeper understanding of the wind regime and its associated properties, with particular attention to the Brazilian continental shelf, suggesting that the methodology is useful for assessing the potential of offshore wind power generation.","Navy","University of Surrey"

First, research often fails to distinguish between two widely cited, yet distinct definitions of MI. The two models conceptualise perpetration-based experiences and betrayal-based experiences respectively, which have been shown to have different outcomes in the literature. Further, Moral Injury is a clinician developed construct and there is a lack of research seeking to explore the qualitative experiences of veterans. Finally, UK research has tended to conceptualise Moral Injury using a perpetration-based model and it is unclear to what extent a betrayal-based model is relevant to this population. 
 
This study aimed to explore UK military veterans understanding of morality, and the ways in which this was ‘injured’ in relation to their military experiences, through the use of semi structured interviews. During the initial stages of an inductive reflexive thematic analysis, it was identified that participants described experiences consistent with a model of betrayal-based Moral Injury and the paper therefore sought to provide an interpretation of participants experiences though this theoretical lens. The analysis constructed two subthemes: (1) ‘what’s’ right’: a military moral compass, and (2) betrayal of what’s right by leaders and systems. 
 
The findings of this research demonstrated the usefulness of a model of betrayal-based Moral Injury to explore the experiences of UK military veterans and thus poses important implications for future Moral Injury research and clinical practice. It is recommended that future research continues to delineate between perpetration and betrayal-based Moral Injury and that intervention research considers specific components of betrayal-based Moral Injury in their development and research.","Navy","University of Surrey"

Part I of the dissertation described the historical background to 1951. It dealt with the various concession agreements, the impact of oil revenues on the Iranian economy and the state of the domestic distribution network. Part II was concerned with the activities of NIOC and the Iranian Government in exercising a firmer control over the Iranian oil industry in the period 1951-71. The concessionary and non-concessionary agreements were considered and an analysis was made of the profitability of each type of contract. The role of OPEC and its influence on the Iranian oil industry was also examined. Finally, the effect of oil revenues on the domestic economy was investigated and contrasted with the period up to 1951. Part III dealt with the domestic activities of NIOC in the period 1951-71. It reviewed the objectives of the Company and the manner of their implementation. Thus, exploration, production, distribution and transport were studied. The growth of Iranian demand was next considered and this led to the investigation of the apparent imbalance in patterns of supply and demand, its effects, and the examination of possible remedies. Also, prices, profits and costs of NIOC were analysed. It was shown that the government's attitude towards prices was the single most important factor in causing the imbalance between the supply and demand. Moreover, the price stabilization policy resulted in cross-subsidization which detrimentally affected some regions. Finally, it was shown that the Company' s activities could not be judged on a purely commercial basis and that the government's intervention, direct and indirect, has had a major effect on its development.","Navy","University of Surrey"
"Accurate ion beam analysis.","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Accurate-ion-beam-analysis/99511046202346?institution=44SUR_INST","Ghislain. Boudreault","2002","This thesis primarily deals with accuracy obtainable when using IBA (Ion Beam Analysis) techniques to characterize materials. RBS (Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry) is the main technique used, together with EBS (Elastic Backscattering Spectrometry), ERDA (Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis) and NRA (Nuclear Reaction Analysis). An exhaustive literature review on these analytical methods is made in connection with accuracy issues such as stopping powers and multiple scattering. The experimental set-ups and procedures are described, with emphasis laid on critical aspects of work where the highest accuracy is required. The instrumentation for dosimetry on ion implanters is first estabhshed at the 1% level for high-dose heavy implants in silicon. A new parameterisation of He stopping power in Si is used, and this latter material, via the surface yield, is used as a calibration standard. A precision (standard uncertainty) in the determination of implantation doses by RBS is conclusively demonstrated at 1.5%. The IBA DataFurnace code is validated for such accurate analysis, which can now be made routinely and rapidly. The certified Sb sample IRMM-302/BAM-L001, which has a certification of 0.6% traceable to the international standard of weight in Paris, is measured, and more importantly this measurement demonstrates the reliability of the stopping power parameterisation at 1.4%. Using conventional ERDA, the H dose of an amorphised Si wafer, implanted with 6-keV H+ ions, is found to be 57.8(1.0)x1015 at/cm2, which is a 1.8% standard uncertainty. The estimated combined uncertainty of this measurement is ~6%, and this mainly comes from the determination of the ERDA solid angle by using standard Kapton. The Kapton composition is carefully determined using RBS. The RBS solid angle is obtained using the amorphised silicon surface yield as a calibration standard as in the dosimetry analysis mentioned above. The ERDA H absolute dose obtained is compared with the results from other participants from all over the world in a Round Robin exercise, which includes measurements by using both He-ERDA and HI-ERDA (Heavy Ion-ERDA) together using various detectors. The results from each participant are given and compared. The overall absolute dose obtained of the implant is 57.0(1.2)x1015 H/cm2, and this represents an inter-lab reproducibility of 2.2% (standard uncertainty). Unstable surface hydrogen contamination was observed, and this surface peak was resolved by some of the methods. This implant can now be used as a standard for quantitative analysis of hydrogen. Low-fluorine content SiO2:F films are analysed by RBS for absolute fluorine concentration determination. Prior to the RBS analysis, the uniformity of the films and stability of F under beam irradiation is investigated. Because the RBS is not very sensitive to F and the F signal has a large matrix background, an internally consistent method of data handling, which enables the relative collected charge to be determined very precisely for the spectra from different samples, is developed. This method has as a parameter the F content, which is then extracted iteratively. A F concentration of 10 at% is determined with an estimated uncertainty of 10% (one percentage point, i.e. 10 +/- 1%). The O stopping powers are found to be the main factor governing the accuracy of the absolute determination of the F content. All the other uncertainties add up to only ~1%. The elemental composition of residual deposits from an ion implanter is thoroughly investigated using several complementary analytical methods, namely, RBS, BBS and NRA. Preliminary SEM/EDAX results are used as a guide. Depth profiles of such non-homogeneous, non-fiat and brittle samples are obtained, which give an indication of the concentration of each element present. From this complete IBA elemental study, some unprecedented light is brought on both the history of the implanter and the way in which these deposits are formed. Such an investigation is essential for a better understanding and the development/miniaturisation of semiconductors as it impressively pushes the boundaries of accuracy obtainable in IBA material characterisation.","Navy","University of Surrey"

Having methods to create a sense of presence and to control this attribute in immersive content are therefore valuable capabilities in sound design, particularly in object-based audio. This paper examines the ability of the reverberant spatial audio object (RSAO) to cue apparent source distance, using acoustic parameters extracted from publicly-available spatial room impulse responses (RIRs) of real environments measured at a range of source-receiver distances. The RSAO's spatio-temporal reverb representation derived from the directional B-format RIRs encoded the timing, direction and timbre of early reflections, as well as the onset, colouration and decay times of the late reverberation, which were rendered over a 42.1 setup in an acoustically- treated listening room to provide a quasi-transparent pipeline for the reproduced room impression, from recording to listening. An objective analysis of re-synthesised RIRs and re-estimated parameters demonstrated the pipeline's transparency for most parameters. However spectral leakage of bandpass filters in the late tail encouraged reverb time convergence across bands. Formal listening tests evaluated the apparent source distance that participants perceived via a multi-stimulus rating method. Statistical analysis indicates participants perceived reproduced distance changes, with logarithmic distance resolution inside the rooms' critical distance. Beyond this, ratings tended to saturate. These effects were clearer in the large hall than in the classroom, and for the voice source than the percussion. The results suggest that the RSAO can provide appropriate cues for source distance perception with resolution comparable to natural sound fields. Further work will investigate how distance perception performs across reproduction setups and develop methods to extrapolate source distance by adapting the RSAO parameters.","Navy","University of Surrey"

The core executive has been able to structure military input to defence planning effectively at the tactical and operational levels. However, the core executive's capacity to provide clear guidance on the balance to be struck between capabilities and force postures relevant to contemporary and future conflict scenarios has been impeded by the British electoral cycle.

The reason is simple: drones are used outside areas of active hostilities in civilian populated areas where no other weapon could be used. The oft-repeated mantra that drones are more precise and less destructive and therefore spare more civilian lives rests on a false comparison. Many commentators wrongly assume that if we were not using drones, we would be using some less precise and more destructive alternative, such as cruise missiles. Apart from the difficulties in deploying cruise missiles covertly and their inability to strike with drone accuracy, cruise missile strikes in civilian populated areas would almost certainly violate the laws of distinction and proportionality and, even if technically legal, would be politically unpalatable. Drones thus put lethal force on the table where it would otherwise be absent and they highlight the lack of law designed to regulate their use. Because the law of armed conflict was developed for active war zones, it is inadequate to govern drone strikes in areas away from active hostilities. As a result, the laws of distinction and proportionality, which govern the use of lethal military force, must be reformulated for drone strikes. Rather than focusing solely on the commander’s intent to target enemy combatants, distinction should require a functional analysis of the geographic area to be destroyed by a strike—the death zone. Where the death zone by its nature, location, purpose or use is substantially a civilian object, such as an outdoor market or a civilian apartment building, the death zone as a whole should be deemed a civilian object, regardless of the presence of an otherwise valid military objective, such as an enemy militant. Once a target satisfies distinction, our assessment of proportionality should take into account not only the civilian casualties likely to result from the strike, but also the strategic costs and negative secondary effects of deploying aerial strikes in civilian areas.","Navy","University of Surrey"

Abstract 
In the fashion domain, there exists a variety of vision- 
and-language (V+L) tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, 
text-guided image retrieval, multi-modal classification, and 
image captioning. They differ drastically in each individ- 
ual input/output format and dataset size. It has been com- 
mon to design a task-specific model and fine-tune it in- 
dependently from a pre-trained V+L model (e.g., CLIP). 
This results in parameter inefficiency and inability to ex- 
ploit inter-task relatedness. To address such issues, we pro- 
pose a novel FAshion-focused Multi-task Efficient learn- 
ing method for Vision-and-Language tasks (FAME-ViL) in 
this work. Compared with existing approaches, FAME-ViL 
applies a single model for multiple heterogeneous fashion 
tasks, therefore being much more parameter-efficient. It 
is enabled by two novel components: (1) a task-versatile 
architecture with cross-attention adapters and task-specific 
adapters integrated into a unified V+L model, and (2) a sta- 
ble and effective multi-task training strategy that supports 
learning from heterogeneous data and prevents negative 
transfer. Extensive experiments on four fashion tasks show 
that our FAME-ViL can save 61.5% of parameters over 
alternatives, while significantly outperforming the conven- 
tional independently trained single-task models. Code is

In 2058, climatologist Clyde Factor travels to London to join the prestigious but mysterious Institute. Only after he arrives is he told that the job will involve time travel. Paired with Eleanor DeQuincy, a hard-headed criminologist, Clyde becomes part of team three, whose study proposes using violent ecoterrorist attacks to incite early action on climate change and save the human species. Six teams compete to have their project chosen for implementation, altering the course of history. But only one project will be selected, and time is running out. Factor and DeQuincy travel to a number of disturbing events, watching horrendous effects unfold with a disquieting prior knowledge of what will happen, and a mandate not to intervene. These horrors are balanced by opportunities to see the world as it had been when they were younger, but these moments also remind them of all they’ve lost. 
 
The second part of this thesis is a critical commentary exploring the relationship between climate fiction and readers, particularly how climate fiction can reflect the personal psychological journeys of authors, characters, and readers. It provides an overview of ecocriticism and climate fiction criticism, and analyses the ways in which climate fiction overlaps with protest fiction, discussing the import of portraying affect and trauma in climate fiction. Finally, these elements are discussed in the context of the creative project, Solastalgia. Overarchingly, the commentary argues that climate fiction is a form of protest fiction in which authors and readers interact in traumatic future worlds that reflect and predict their personal experiences within the slow trauma of climate change, and that careful use of trauma and affect can heighten the emotional connection between story and reader, which can make climate fiction more effective protest fiction.""","Navy","University of Surrey"

McGill","1988","First the method of gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) has been used to obtain partition coefficients, K, at infinite dilution on polymeric and non-polymeric phases. About 30-40 solutes were studied per stationary phase. Secondly the method of gas-solid chromatography has been used to obtain adsorption isotherms for a series of adsorbents by the technique of elution by characteristic point (ECP). A single injection of a gas or vapour suffices to obtain the isotherm, and then the limiting Henry's law constant, Kh, for adsorption at low surface coverage. About 20-30 solutes were studied per adsorbent. Experiments were carried out at several levels of relative humidity (RH) 0%, 31% and 53%. The solute compounds used were chosen so as to have a wide range of properties such as polarity (pi*2), hydrogen-bond acidity (alpha[H]2), and hydrogen-bond basicity (beta[H]2). The results as log partition coefficients or -log Henry's constants were analysed by multiple linear regression analysis using equations such as: -LogK[H] or LogK = SPo + s.pi* 2 + a.alpha[H]2 + b.beta[H]2 + 1. LogL[18] where L[18] is the solute Ostwald absorption coefficient on n-hexadecane. In this way, the selectivity of the liquid polymeric phase or solid adsorbent towards classes of compound was investigated and equations for the prediction of further values of LogK or LogK[H] formulated. In parallel with the measurement of partition coefficients on liquid polymeric phases by GLC in this work, partition coefficients for the polymers have been determined using surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices by coworkers at the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington. The results for a series of 8-9 solutes in six polymeric phases show that partition coefficients and patterns of responses predicted through GLC experiments are the same as those found experimentally using coated SAW devices. Hence GLC can be used to evaluate possible coating materials, and by the technique of multiple linear regression analysis, to predict SAW responses for a multitude of vapours.","Navy","University of Surrey"

Baseline measures included exposure to job demands, decision latitude, social support and need for recovery. Psychological distress was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire at baseline and at follow-up. The findings showed that medium and high exposure to job demands and social support increased the risk of reporting psychological distress at 15-months (relative risk (RR) = 1.65, 1.45). The highest adjusted RR was observed for workers reporting a high need for recovery after work (RR 2.12, 1.90) and this finding was independent of the effects of job demands, decision latitude and social support. Neither decision latitude, nor low back problems increased the risk of reporting future psychological distress, although neck problems (RR = 1.66) and hand/wrist problems (RR = 1.45) did. It was concluded that need for recovery appears to be an important indicator of individual workers who are at risk of developing psychological distress long term. Statement of Relevance: This paper reports the findings of a longitudinal study showing that need for recovery from work was the strongest predictor, relative to psychosocial work characteristics (job demands, decision latitude and social support), and musculoskeletal problems, of psychological distress 15 months later in individuals initially free from distress.","Navy","University of Surrey"

Our AI agent can autonomously sketch a given visual concept, and achieve a recognizable rendition as quickly or faster than a human competitor. The key to victory for the agent’s goal is to learn the optimal stroke sequencing strategies that generate the most recognizable and distinguishable strokes first. Training Pixelor is done in two steps. First, we infer the stroke order that maximizes early recognizability of human training sketches. Second, this order is used to supervise the training of a sequence-to-sequence stroke generator. Our key technical contributions are a tractable search of the exponential space of orderings using neural sorting; and an improved Seq2Seq Wasserstein (S2S-WAE) generator that uses an optimal-transport loss to accommodate the multi-modal nature of the optimal stroke distribution. Our analysis shows that Pixelor is better than the human players of the Quick, Draw! game, under both AI and human judging of early recognition. To analyze the impact of human competitors’ strategies, we conducted a further human study with participants being given unlimited thinking time and training in early recognizability by feedback from an AI judge. The study shows that humans do gradually improve their strategies with training, but overall Pixelor still matches human performance.

Therefore, the space industry has been considering using robotic technologies to build future optical reflecting three-mirror structured space telescopes in orbit from smaller components.</p> <p>One of the design paradigms is to use a high-DOF manipulator on a free-flying platform to build the optical telescope in orbit. This approach requires high precision and accuracy in the robotic manipulation GNC system that has several challenges yet to be addressed: 1. Orbital environmental parameters that affect sensing and perception; 2. Limitations in robotic hardware, trajectory planning algorithms and controllers.</p> <p>To investigate these problems for in-orbit manipulation, the UK national hub on future AI and robotics for space (FAIR-SPACE) at the Surrey Space Centre (SSC) has been developing a ground-based hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) robotic demonstrator to simulate in-orbit manipulation. The key elements of the demonstrator are two 6-DOF manipulators and a re-configurable sensor system. One of the manipulators with a > 3-DOF gripping mechanism represents the assembly manipulator on a spacecraft whose orbital dynamics, kinematics, and environmental disturbances and uncertainties are propagated in a computer. The other 6-DOF manipulator with a torque/force sensor is used as a gravity offoad mechanism to carry the space telescope mirror segment. The relative motions between the service/manipulation arm and the mirror segment are computed and then executed by the second arm. The sensor system provides visual feedback of the end-effector and uses computer vision and AI to estimate the pose and position of the mirror segment respectively. The demonstrator aims to verify and validate the manipulator assembly approach for future large space optical telescopes against ground truth and benchmarks.</p> <p>This paper explains the motivation behind developing this testbed and introduces the current hardware setup of the testbed and its key features.</p>","Ai","University of Surrey"

However, when considering any such model it’s important to remember Box’s maxim that ""All models are wrong but some are useful."" We focus on the distinction between these models and explanations in philosophy and sociology. These models can be understood as a ""do it yourself kit"" for explanations, allowing a practitioner to directly answer ""what if questions"" or generate contrastive explanations without external assistance. Although a valuable ability, giving these models as explanations appears more difficult than necessary, and other forms of explanation may not have the same trade-offs. We contrast the different schools of thought on what makes an explanation, and suggest that machine learning might benefit from viewing the problem more broadly.","Ai","University of Surrey"

These involve (1) slimming the libraries and frameworks (e.g., pytorch) used, down to pieces pertaining to the solution; (2) dynamically loading pre-trained AI/ML models into local temporary storage, during serverless function invocation; (3) using separate frameworks for training and inference, with ONNX model formatting; and, (4) performance-oriented tuning for data storage and lookup. The techniques are illustrated via worked examples that have been deployed live on geospatial data from the transportation domain.  This draws upon a real-world case study in intelligent transportation looking at on-demand, realtime predictions of flows of train movements across the UK rail network. Evaluation of the proposed techniques shows the response time, for varying volumes of queries involving prediction, to remain almost constant (at 50 ms), even as the database scales up to the 250M entries. The query response time is important in this context as the target is predicting train delays. It is even more important in a serverless environment due to the stringent constraints on serverless functions’ runtime before timeout. The similarities of a serverless environment to other resource constrained environments (e.g., IoT, telecoms) means the techniques can be applied to a range of use cases.","Ai","University of Surrey"

However, Murphy, Gretzel, and Pesonen (2019) observe that many tourism businesses still fail to make the most of the available technology. Faced with a plethora of possibilities, tourism operators may find it difficult to decide which technologies to adopt and which to ignore. Equally challenging might be deciding where, when, and how a new technology should be introduced, as well as understanding what its impacts might be for the individual, organisation, and the industry. The situation calls for research methods suitable for addressing forward-looking research questions with complex practical, ethical, and socio-economic implications, including the impacts of automation on customer experience, management, and regulation. Following in the footsteps of Wengel, McIntosh, and Cockburn-Wootten (2016), it can be suggested that serious gaming, in particular a method known as LEGO® Serious Play®, will help tourism researchers and practitioners better navigate and harness the dynamic landscape of emerging technology.

Suggestions for improving the platform included the addition of specialist vocabulary functionality, shot-type detection, film-topic labelling, and automatic music recognition. The limitations of the study are, most notably, the current level of accuracy achieved in computer vision outputs (i.e. automated video descriptions of film material) which has been hindered by the lack of reliable and accurate training data, and the need for a more narratively oriented interface which allows describers to develop their storytelling techniques and build descriptions which fit within a platform-hosted storyboarding functionality. While this work has value in its own right, it can also be regarded as paving the way for the future (semi)automation of audio descriptions to assist audiences experiencing sight impairment, cognitive accessibility difficulties or for whom ‘visionless’ multimedia consumption is their preferred option.","Ai","University of Surrey"
"Assessing Turnover Intentions of Algorithmically Managed Hospitality Workers","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/conferencePaper/Assessing-Turnover-Intentions-of-Algorithmically-Managed/99728066402346?institution=44SUR_INST","Mónica Segovia-Perez; Branislava Jianu (Corresponding Author); Iis Tussyadiah (Author)","15/01/2023","Employee turnover has been one of the main concerns facing the hospitality industry. This issue seems to be aggravated in artificial intelligence (AI) environment, where AI implementation is associated with pressure, job alienation, and labor replacement, increasing workers’ desire to quit their job. To analyze the relationship between AI awareness, job alienation, discrimination, and turnover intention, an online survey was distributed to hospitality employees (n = 450). From a series of independent-samples T-tests and regression analyses, this study found employees’ turnover intentions are significantly associated with employees’ concerns of being replaced by AI, perception of job alienation, and workplace discrimination. Importantly, current algorithmically managed workers tend to feel more powerless and discriminated against, and thus have higher turnover intentions. Recommendations for practice and future research are provided.","Ai","University of Surrey"
"Factors Influencing Users’ Willingness to Adopt and Use Artificially Intelligent Assistants for Travel","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Factors-Influencing-Users-Willingness-to-Adopt/99594823802346?institution=44SUR_INST","CHAO  LING","31/08/2021","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed various industries, including the tourism and hospitality industry. AI Assistants are one example of AI adoption in the tourism and hospitality industry. AI assistants can aid travellers in searching for information and simplify their travel planning process. They can also help travel companies to deliver personalised, efficient, and effective customer service. Though research has hinted about how AI systems are transforming travel experiences, little research to-date has focused on how travellers evaluate the use of AI Assistants. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the determinants of user satisfaction of and behavioural intentions towards AI Assistants in the context of travel. Specifically, this thesis explored which factors determine user satisfaction of Human-AI Assistant interaction process and outcomes, and the willingness to adopt and use AI Assistants in the future for travel purposes.  
 
Following a mixed-methods explanatory sequential design, this thesis consists of four distinct studies, including: Study 1: systematic literature review (n = 18), Study 2: a qualitative study using content analysis (interviews, n = 42), Study 3: laboratory experiments (n = 70), and Study 4: online surveys utilising Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) (n = 1066). The four studies are interrelated. Considering the context of the study is relatively new, this thesis applies abductive approach to provide better insights into the use of AI Assistants. The conceptual model was developed based on the findings from qualitative phases, the updated IS Success Model, and the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2). The findings indicated that perceived, perceived safety, and expectancy are core determinants of user satisfaction with information, while perceived safety and expectancy have significant influence on user satisfaction with interaction process. The results confirmed the important positive role of user satisfaction in user behavioural intentions.","Ai","University of Surrey"

"New Recombinant Mycobacterium bovis BCG Expression Vectors: Improving Genetic Control over Mycobacterial Promoters.","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/New-Recombinant-Mycobacterium-bovis-BCG-Expression/99515931202346?institution=44SUR_INST","AI Kanno; C Goulart; HK Rofatto; SC Oliveira; LC Leite; J McFadden","15/04/2016","The expression of many antigens, stimulatory molecules, or even metabolic pathways in mycobacteria such asMycobacterium bovisBCG orM. smegmatiswas made possible through the development of shuttle vectors, and several recombinant vaccines have been constructed. However, gene expression in any of these systems relied mostly on the selection of natural promoters expected to provide the required level of expression by trial and error. To establish a systematic selection of promoters with a range of strengths, we generated a library of mutagenized promoters through error-prone PCR of the strong PL5promoter, originally from mycobacteriophage L5. These promoters were cloned upstream of the enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene, and recombinantM. smegmatisbacteria exhibiting a wide range of fluorescence levels were identified. A set of promoters was selected and identified as having high (pJK-F8), intermediate (pJK-B7, pJK-E6, pJK-D6), or low (pJK-C1) promoter strengths in bothM. smegmatisandM. bovisBCG. The sequencing of the promoter region demonstrated that it was extensively modified (6 to 11%) in all of the plasmids selected. To test the functionality of the system, two different expression vectors were demonstrated to allow corresponding expression levels of theSchistosoma mansoniantigen Sm29 in BCG. The approach used here can be used to adjust expression levels for synthetic and/or systems biology studies or for vaccine development to maximize the immune response.","Ai","University of Surrey"
