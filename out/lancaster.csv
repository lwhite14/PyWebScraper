Nevertheless, research in industrial organization that has focused on the influences on firmsurvival has largely ignored the potential effects from agglomeration. Recent studies in urban and regional economics suggest that agglomeration effects may be very localized. Analyses of industry concentration at the MSA or county-level may fail to detect important elements of intra-industry firm interaction that occur at the sub-MSA level. Using a highly detailed dataset on firm locations and characteristics for Texas, this paper analyses agglomeration effects on firmsurvival over geographic areas as small as a single mile radius. We find that greater firm density within very close proximity (within 1 mile) of firms in the same industry increases mortality rates while greater concentration over larger distances reduces mortality rates.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

Attention is focused on distinguishing different financing methods according to particular stages of an SME's business life cycle. The findings show the importance of informal financial sources from individuals and firms’ employees for high-tech SMEs at all three development stages. Such sources have become a central aspect of the financial infrastructure for the private sector in China. The article distinguishes between the alternative methods or practices used by firms at all three stages, seeking to either overcome particular financial constraints or to avoid the commitment of large capital investments in relatively long-term projects. It identifies the absence of demands and a gap for medium- and long-term funding for high-tech SMEs, placing a serious barrier on the ability of high-tech SMEs to engage in R&D for making more fundamental innovation and developing new/distinctive products. It concludes by making the implications of these findings for China, and internationally.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

In the empirical part of the paper, through a rigorous quantitative analysis of unique data from 264 Italian high-tech entrepreneurial ventures, we explore whether in high-tech industries family entrepreneurial ventures are more (or less) likely to pursue internationalization than their nonfamily counterparts. Surprisingly enough, our econometric estimates indicate that, in high-tech industries, family entrepreneurial ventures exhibit a higher internationalization propensity than their nonfamily peers","Tech","University of Lancaster"

The findings were based on a set of longitudinal datasets including two rounds of face to face interviews with the owners of high-tech SMEs and finance providers in the Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi. It shows that the responses of high-tech SMEs and informal investors to the institutional changes have been more positive compared with those of banks. Consequently, access to informal sources of finance has grown, including to longer term equity finance, whereas that to bank finance has not significantly improved. The paper contributes to institutional theory by providing that the effects of the overall institutional framework on the optimal selection of formal and informal institutional arrangements to secure funding differ between types of finance provider and are not necessarily positively associated with the phases of the institutional transitions.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

These differences may result from the relative success of national and regional policy initiatives or more simply the ability of businesses to access finance. High-tech businesses are being encouraged by China’s government as a means of rebalancing regional development from the existing physical resource-intensive industries. In this paper we examine the experiences of high-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in relation to securing finance, evaluating the experiences at the three stages in their development. The empirical evidence, based on seventy-four face-to-face interviews with owners and senior managers of high-tech SMEs and on nine with bank and government officials, facilitates a comparison of the two study regions, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The findings indicate significant differences in the availability and nature of financial sources between the two regions. Firms in the more-developed Eastern region experience access to a wider range of funds from both formal and informal sources than their counterparts in the less-developed Western region. Although this was evident at all three stages of the business development cycle, it was more significant during the earlier stages of development. The consequences of such a disparity in financial sources may lead to further exacerbation of the regional differences and hence prove counterproductive in seeking to develop a more balanced strategy of economic development. We conclude by discussing the prospects for improving this present situation through policy initiatives.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

Our findings show that three (four) configurations can result in high (low)-firm performance, demonstrating that the EO dimensions can contribute to as well as hinder firm performance. Moreover, the configurations leading to the same outcome are distinct between high-tech and low-tech firms, indicating that the impacts of the EO dimensions on firm performance depend on the firm context.

An initial analysis uses a framework, which sees digital literacy as an interaction between skills, practices and identity. The findings highlight not only the importance of identity but also the need for a more detailed understanding of identity than the one provided by this model. Findings related to identity are then analysed further. In the process, four specific and contradictory themes are revealed – technology advocate, technology sceptic, technology adept and technology novice. In addition, the importance of other identity markers in relation to technology is explored. In the context of individuals and organisations prioritising the enhancement of digital literacy, this paper suggests that the role of identity in such enhancement is critical and is not sufficiently captured in current research and discussion.

It contributes to the longstanding theoretical debate between the resource-based and entrepreneurship views of the firm. Scholars from the resource-based perspective argue that resource constraints increase delays and unpredictable results, which thereby to impede innovation. Entrepreneurship research however suggests that organizations avoid experimentation if resources are available, and that resource scarcity therefore stimulates managers to adopt entrepreneurial practices that foster innovation. This points to our imperfect understanding on the issue.This paper contributes to both theoretical advance and managerial practice. First, to correct the bias from a disproportionate amount of interest to financial barriers, we provide a more balanced and integrated view by considering other important resource constraints. Second, to observe the difference of two types of innovation, we augment the literature by studying the effects of resource constraints on both incremental and radical innovativeness and on firms’ performance of sales and R&D growth. Finally, the issue of resource constraints is an inevitable challenge, and the findings of the paper provide some guidance to managers and innovators who are struggling with the lack of resources on one hand and with the pressure of innovation and competitiveness on the other hand. This paper is unique in presenting a long-term, longitudinal analysis of the impact of resource constraints on innovation, both radical and incremental. It presents a ten-year longitudinal study following 362 firms through the life cycle. We use panel analysis techniques to observe the impact of resource constraints on subsequent innovative performance. A research framework is derived from the literature review. We examine the knowledge shortfalls of: management; market; sales; production; R&D and finance. This    analysis is based upon a unique, longitudinal panel dataset of 241 UK and German firms in six technology-based sectors over ten years. The dataset draws upon performance data as well as the results of detailed managerial surveys that were carried out in the UK and Germany. This, combined with information provided by interviewees about the firms’ characteristics upon founding, provides a unique and rich longitudinal perspective on factors contributing to the long-run performance of these firms. This study is based on two surveys that were carried out in 1997 and again in 2003. Using these databases, all firms with at least three employees in 1997 that were operating in one or more high-tech sectors and having been founded as legally independent companies between 1987 and 1996 were selected; the mean year of founding was 1991. Our approach to the problem involves initial use of panel logit models to predict the likelihood of a firm engaging in incremental or radical innovation. Our model is specified in a manner that we consider the lagged effect of the resource constraints in t0 on propensity for innovation in period t1. Our other controls listed above all are used for period t1. Given challenges in interpreting logit models we present the results in the form of marginal effects. Following from this analysis we then use panel OLS models to explore the impact of these constraints on subsequent innovation and growth performance.  Does the lack of knowledge hamper or trigger innovation? The answer is rather mixed. While our study indicates that the lack of knowledge may not hamper innovation development for both incremental and radical, it suggests that the lack of knowledge does matter when considering sales growth and R&D growth.For radical innovation, our study suggests that the lack of management knowledge may trigger sales growth. Un-surprized, the lack of R&D knowledge triggers R&D growth of firms. This may be explained in two ways. First, the lack of R&D knowledge leads firm to increase R&D investment. Furthermore, the nature of radical innovation may also lead the innovative firms to discard prior R&D knowledge in order to build up new R&D knowledge. Finally, our study echoes the extant literature that the lack of financial knowledge hampers the R&D growth.For incremental innovation, our study once again stresses the significant impact of the lack of financial knowledge on innovation and suggests that the shortfall of financial knowledge hampers sales growth. It further suggests that the lack of market knowledge hampers R&D growth. This result also suggests that market knowledge is critical for firms in deciding their R&D investment. Finally, our study suggests that the lack of production knowledge triggers R&D growth. Managers tend to increase R&D investment when they need production knowledge.Through a ten-year longitudinal study, our study contributes to the existing literature by advancing the understanding of the association between resources constraints and innovation. Building on the theories of human capital, entrepreneurship and RBV, we shed light about the impact of knowledge shortfalls on both radical and incremental innovation. Finally, our study helps to explain the disputes of whether resource constraints hamper or trigger innovation. The study also has implications for executives and managers. It demonstrates that managers can harness the entrepreneurship practices by minimizing their interference for radical innovativeness. Managers and innovators hare encouraged to update their market knowledge that serves an important indicator for R&D investment. Furthermore, as suggested by many researchers, financial knowledge is always important in operating and managing innovation for both sales and R&D growth. Indeed, innovative firms face problems and more innovative firms have more problems. The issue of resources constrains is not only critical but also difficult to deal with. We hope our paper inspires researchers to conduct further research in the future.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

Results on a sample of Italian entrepreneurial ventures in high-tech industries support our arguments.

Despite the Italian industrial system being only marginally present in the Japanese market, in comparison to other European countries, interesting interaction dynamics are detectable between Japanese and Italian industrial companies active in medium and high-tech technology sectors. By adopting the Uppsala Model for internationalization and the IMP Group relationship marketing perspective approach, four case studies of Italian companies who successfully invested in Japan are addressed. The companies are analyzed with respect to their entry strategies and to their progressive commitment into the Japanese market, following a stage-based approach aiming at further strengthening their credibility. The common aspects in the process of Italian firms approaching the market are passed in review and properly discussed in the last section of the paper, together with difficulties and peculiarities characterizing the integration of foreign companies in the local supply chains. Moreover, the role of Japan as a “learing market” for the investing firms is considered, especially in terms of acquired competitive advantages and potential gains to be exploited also in other attractable markets for their business.

Recent research claims digital technology can enable new kinds of development processes that are distinctive from their counterparts in 20th century. However, although academics and practitioners often critically debate the IoT, minimal attention has been focused on new product development (NPD) processes; arguably, one of the most critical marketing plans and implementation process activities undertaken within the organisation. Thus, this paper aims to contribute to a new understanding of IoT NPD processes. To achieve this aim, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken primarily focusing on traditional NPD design processes and reviewed against, a featured case study, IoT NPD processes. The relevance of IoT NPD against the characteristics of existing NPD processes, are subsequently reviewed and critically debated. Finally, NPD processes and the meaning of design within an IoT context is critically reframed. In essence, this paper summarises how NPD processes and the role of design could be improved and proposes a set of guidelines with an accompanying conceptual framework for IoT NPD processes.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

To address this research gap, the current study uses a mixed-methods design. First, a qualitative study with 20 venturing experts (entrepreneurs and investors) validates various effectuation logics and uncovers the following four antecedents of effectuation and causation: founders’ perceived uncertainty, entrepreneurial experience, management experience, and investor influence. Second, a large-scale quantitative study of founders in online, software, and high-tech start-ups (n = 435) provides statistical support for the identified antecedents, using structural equation modeling and multigroup comparisons over early and later venture stages. The study confirms the multifaceted nature of effectuation; experimentation is the only effectual logic that reflects influences of all the determinants. Founders’ prior experiences affect experimentation and causation in the early venture stage, but not during the later stages. Investor influence displays the broadest array of effects on the decision logics, offering both theoretical embeddedness for effectuation and a new, practically relevant driver.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

However, as our inquiry of the initiatives undertaken by sex-tech women entrepreneurs unveils, these entrepreneurs can engage in cultural entrepreneurship to innovate and reconfigure the meanings associated with their products to legitimize them as social innovations. Data show entrepreneurs: (a) designing and commercializing embodied products to address unmet needs, (b) engaging in discursive practices to create a new language, and (c) engaging in social action while aligning with other social movements. These practices together led to a cultural reconfiguration, i.e., shifting the meaning of sex-tech products from immoral to a health and wellness devices, resulting in the legitimation of sex tech as a social innovation and conversion of tainted cultural resources into valuable ones.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

To better understand how leaders enable IT ambidexterity, this study focuses on the leadership decision-making style (directive decision-making and participative decision-making) as a key driving factor. Moreover, we examine how and when leadership decision-making styles are most effective in enacting IT ambidexterity by considering new product development (NPD) team diversity and shared vision as two important contingencies. Finally, we test the role of IT ambidexterity in improving NPD performance. We analyse our research model using survey data from 292 high-tech SMEs. Our findings suggest that both decision-making styles enable IT ambidexterity, however, participative decision-making style is more effective in highly diverse NPD teams and directive decision-making style should be preferred when shared vision is a dominant factor among NPD team members. Our results also show that IT ambidexterity significantly enhances NPD performance.

We find that stronger intellectual property (IP) protection has a sharper impact on technologically advanced firms, i.e., firms that were a-priori above the industry median in terms of technology adoption. While there is an overall increase in managers' share of compensation, this increase is about 1.6-1.7% more for high-tech firms. This difference can be attributed to a larger increase in performance pay for high-tech firms. The reform also leads to a significant increase in number of managerial layers and number of divisions for high-tech firms relative to low-tech firms, but only the latter effect is correlated with the differential change in managerial compensation. Broadly, we demonstrate that stronger IP protection leads to an increase in both within-firm and between-firm wage inequality, with more robust evidence for between-firm inequality.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

The project grappled with what the concept of public good means in a context like South Africa.  A tendency was noted for conceptualizing South African higher education as a single undifferentiated system. It also noted that far more is known about higher education in historically advantaged institutions than about historically disadvantaged institutions. Overall the entwined nature of the reproductive and transformative functions of higher education mean that developing a higher education system so that it can play a deliberate role in transforming society is extremely difficult, even though it is clear that many students are personally transformed by their experiences.

Results from a coupled deployment of pore-water gel probes in Loch Duich, Scotland, provide direct evidence for rapid recycling within the iron reduction (FeR) and sulphate reduction (SR) zones. High resolution pore-water profiles obtained using diffusive equilibrium in thin films (DET) gel probes found a nitrate peak at the boundary between the FeR and SR zones. This non-steady state feature is consistent with recycling of reduced N occurring throughout the FeR zone. Both conventional pore-water iron profiles and results from diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) probes indicate that iron is solubilised and precipitated in rapid Fe/S recycling reactions throughout the SR zone. The presence of such complex recycling reactions confirms the oversimplification of the classical BGZ scheme.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Here, we show fisher-naive behaviour in reef fishes also spills over from marine reserves, potentially increasing access to fishery benefits by making fishes more susceptible to spearguns. The distance at which two targeted families of fishes began to flee a potential fisher [flight initiation distance (FID)] was lower inside reserves than in fished areas, and this reduction extended outside reserve boundaries. Reduced FID persisted further outside reserves than increases in fish biomass. This finding could help increase stakeholder support for marine reserves and improve current models of spillover by informing estimates for spatial changes in catchability. Behavioural changes of fish could help explain differences between underwater visual census and catch data in quantifying the spatial extent of spillover from marine reserves, and should be considered in the management of adjacent fisheries.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

V.","30/09/2022","Due to recent challenges in oil exploration, there has been an increase in oil exploration from shallow waters to deep waters. This requires more length of the risers and thus an increase in the weight of the risers on the offshore structure. Secondly, there is the need for the application of more flexible structures like marine hose systems. Marine hoses are unique marine riser systems which are utilised as conduits to transport fluid from the oil well to the offshore platform of the transport vessel. Marine hoses are also a type of bonded flexible risers that are connected to buoys and other offshore structures but have short service periods. Three types of marine hoses are researched-submarine hoses, floating hoses and reeling hoses. The design for some load cases on the marine hoses is presented. The advantages and brief on state-of-the-art of marine hose structures for deep water applications are presented. Increasing energy needs has also led to advances in ocean monitoring, offloading and loading operations based on the use of Catenary Anchor Leg Moorings (CALM) buoys. However, variations in the soil stiffness and environmental conditions necessitates the investigation on the behaviour of marine hoses, based on the mechanics, structural and hydrodynamic behaviour. In this study, the local design and global design analysis of marine hoses layers were designed. In the numerical modelling, comparisons were made using two (2) configurations- the Lazy-S and Chinese-lantern configurations. However, a new hybrid hose riser configuration was also proposed for the application of marine hoses. Also, some parametric studies on the effect of the buoy shape, and buoy skirt were conducted. A novel coupling model was also proposedwhereby hydrodynamic simulation using ANSYS AQWA was first conducted and later coupled into the dynamic models in Orcaflex. Based on the case study with marine hoses, the dynamic analysis was carried out based on the design of the submarine hoses attached to a CALM buoy using six (6) mooring lines. Experimental work conducted in Lancaster University Wave Tank was also presented using a CALM buoy model. In the wave tank, the motion response of a scaled hull model was investigated using two (2) novel underwater Bluetooth MIT motion sensors, two (2) underwater Akaso 4K cameras, and the Imetrum Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system. A series of hydrodynamic models were created in ANSYS AQWA using environmental conditions specified by API, ABS and DNV to further examine its application foradditional ocean depths and support systems. The Imetrum system results from the wave tank experimental test were used to validate the AQWA model. Results on the effect of wave height, flow angles, soil stiffness and hydrodynamic loads on the structural behaviour of the submarine hoses and composite risers were presented with recommendations. The global analysis carried out on a CALM buoy using these configurations, could be considered in (WA) Weight-added risers, Top Tension Risers (TTR) and a lazywave riser (LWR) formations. The research result shows novel numerical modelling approaches for the design, hydrodynamics and mechanics of marine hoses for oil and gas applications.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

The study found that the USA had the most publications, but there were fewer co-occurrences with connections outside the cluster. Due to the difficulty of adaptation, acceptability, qualification, and deployment of marine hoses in the offshore marine industry, this topic contains more conference papers than journal papers.

One of the most important design decision criteria for marine cranes is to ensure that the stress magnitudes remain below the maximum allowable stress values on the crane’s structural members during their operation. However, a full scale test to investigate such loading during design validation may be a very expensive practice or almost impossible. Therefore, it is considered more practicable to work with scale models to investigate stress distributions and likely deformations physically. This study presents stress analysis for a sample marine crane’s boom, which is originally designed with a boom length of 9 m using experimental and numerical methods. To enable the experimental part of the study, a 1:10 scale model of a sample marine crane’s boom has been considered. Strain measurement techniques (using strain-gauges) were utilised for the experimental stress measurement of the scale model. Finite Element Method (FEM) as a numerical method was used to map and simulate stress distribution on the scaled boom structure.

There are different approaches to estimating environmental contours, some directly linked to methods of structural reliability. Each contouring approach has its pros and cons. Although procedures for applying contours in design have been reported in articles and standards, there is still ambiguity about detail, and the practitioner has considerable flexibility in applying contours. It is not always clear how to estimate environmental contours well. Over four years, DNV-GL, Shell, the University of Oslo and HR Walling-ford worked together to review current practice regarding the use of design contours. In this paper, we present a summary of our findings. We overview the motivations for different approaches to contours, and their resulting characteristics. Using different marine applications, we also explore the various sources of uncertainty present, their impact on contour estimates and the estimation of extreme environmental loads and responses.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 2 relies on greater attention to distribution processes that match food qualities with dietary deficiencies. We explore this in the context of fisheries. Foreign fishing and international trade divert nutrients caught in marine fisheries from nutrient-insecure toward nutrient-secure nations. Where nutrient-insecure countries do benefit from foreign fishing and trade, there tends to be high vulnerability to future changes in nutrient flows arising from changes to foreign fishing and trade. This research highlights the need for greater transparency around distribution of fish and for nutrition security to be considered more centrally in development of trade agreements.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

A. J.","03/2017","The intensity and frequency of climate-driven disturbances are increasing in coastal marine ecosystems. Understanding the factors that enhance or inhibit ecosystem resilience to climatic disturbance is essential. We surveyed 97 experts in six major coastal biogenic ecosystem types to identify “bright spots” of resilience in the face of climate change. We also evaluated literature that was recommended by the experts that addresses the responses of habitat-forming species to climatic disturbance. Resilience was commonly reported in the expert surveys (80% of experts). Resilience was observed in all ecosystem types and at multiple locations worldwide. The experts and literature cited remaining biogenic habitat, recruitment/connectivity, physical setting, and management of local-scale stressors as most important for resilience. These findings suggest that coastal ecosystems may still hold great potential to persist in the face of climate change and that local- to regional-scale management can help buffer global climatic impacts.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

The loss of riverine habitats for Grayling was compared with or without considering the impact of climate change on adjacent marine habitats. We also asked whether considering marine climate change changed the locations where removing dams had the greatest benefit for Grayling conservation.ResultsClimate change is expected to cause local extinction in both marine and river habitats regardless of whether dams are retained or removed at the trailing edge of the Grayling's range (north‐eastern). Decoupling of habitats was most apparent in the eastern and south‐eastern portion of the Grayling's range, where ocean warming may cause a decline in the suitability of marine habitats for larvae, while many freshwater habitats retained suitable habitat for adults. Removing dams to restore connectivity between ocean and freshwater habitats was predicted to have the greatest benefit for Grayling in southern portions of their range. Under climate change, the priorities for barrier removal gradually shift towards dams at higher elevation because of increasing suitability of freshwater habitats at higher elevations.Main conclusionsOur study highlights the importance of assessing climate range shifts in multiple ecosystems for migratory species and can help inform priorities for stream restoration under a changing climate.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

W.","15/06/2023","Early diagenesis of marine organic matter dramatically impacts Earth’s surface chemistry by changing the burial potential of carbon and promoting the formation of authigenic mineral phases including carbonate concretions. Marine sediment-hosted carbonate concretions tend to form as a result of microbial anaerobic diagenetic reactions that degrade organic matter and methane, some of which require an external oxidant. Thus, temporal changes in the oxidation state of Earth’s oceans may impart a first-order control on concretion authigenesis mechanisms through time. Statistically significant variability in concretion carbonate carbon isotope compositions indicates changes in shallow marine sediment diagenesis associated with Earth’s evolving redox landscape. This variability manifests itself as an expansion in carbon isotope composition range broadly characterized by an increase in maximum and decrease in minimum isotope values through time. Reaction transport modelling helps to constrain the potential impacts of shifting redox chemistry and highlights the importance of organic carbon delivery to the seafloor, marine sulfate concentrations, methane production and external methane influx. The first appearance of conclusively anaerobic oxidation of methane-derived concretions occurs in the Carboniferous and coincides with a Paleozoic rise in marine sulfate. The muted variability recognized in older concretions (and in particular for Precambrian concretions) likely reflects impacts of a smaller marine sulfate reservoir and perhaps elevated marine dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations. Causes of the increase in carbon isotope maximum values through time are more confounding, but may be related to isotopic equilibration of dissolved inorganic carbon with externally derived methane. Ultimately the concretion isotope record in part reflects changes in organic matter availability and marine oxidation state, highlighting connections with the subsurface biosphere and diagenesis throughout geologic time.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Overlap with vessel traffic was detected for all areas where whales were sighted, indicating that these species may be at risk of vessel exposure and its associated impacts. Level of exposure to vessel traffic experienced by whales was species-specific, with risk of exposure appearing highest for minke whales.

Biophysical interactions with fragmented canopies are multi-faceted and have many significant implications at multiple scales. The aims of this paper are to review research on biophysical interactions in fragmented marine canopies, identify current gaps in knowledge and understanding, and propose ways forward. The review starts at the patch/gap scale and focuses initially on hydrodynamic interactions. It then considers the consequences of these interactions for particulate and dissolved material, and distributions of canopy-associated organisms. Finally, it addresses issues of upscaling to landscape-scale and ways in which this research can be applied to marine landscape management. Work on a broad range of canopy types is considered, including micro-algal biofilms and turf algae; macro-algae, seagrasses and coral reefs; saltmarsh vegetation and mangroves. Although the focus is on marine canopies, insights from studies of fragmented canopies in other contexts are drawn on where relevant. These include freshwater environments and terrestrial forests, grasslands, crop canopies, and urban areas. Specific areas requiring greater attention are highlighted. As a result of this meta-analysis, the following recommendations are made for further research. A lack of basic data is identified across all canopy types regarding the formation, fate and spatial and temporal characteristics of canopy patches, gaps, and spatial structure. Studies of hydrodynamics with fragmented canopies would benefit from shifting focus toward more non-uniform, realistic configurations, while ecological research in this area would benefit from a move toward configurations that are more controlled and tractable for quantitative modeling. More comparative studies across canopy types would enable understanding of their biophysical interactions and their consequences to be more fully tested and developed. A greater incorporation of chemical aspects of canopy systems into work that has hitherto focused on biophysical interactions would also be pertinent. Upscaling of patch and gap-scale phenomena to landscape-scale is identified as a crucial topic, since it is at the latter scale that management efforts are most readily carried out. Overall, an approach that balances hydrodynamics, marine canopy ecology, spatial analysis of landscapes, biogeochemistry, and socio-environmental interactions is recommended.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

We demonstrate this by reconstructing the underlying social drivers of four iconic marine regime shifts: Pacific kelp forests, Northwest Atlantic continental shelf, Jamaican coral reefs, and the Chesapeake Bay estuary. In all cases, a range of social drivers – including opening of lucrative markets, technological innovations, and policies that enhanced the driver – ultimately prompted these ecosystem shifts. Drawing on examples emerging from environmental management practice, we present three practical recommendations for using social drivers as early indicators: monitor social change, determine social trigger points, and identify policy responses. We argue that accounting for the underlying social drivers of ecosystem change could improve decision making.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Currently, there are approximately 3,400 deep water wells in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) having depths greater than 150 meters, and a worldwide undiscovered deep water reserves estimated to exceed 200 billion barrels and 25% of the total US reserves (BOEM, 2016), while others are in regions such as Angola, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, India, Morocco and the UK.  The application of composite risers in offshore engineering for ultra-deep applications has been facing a lot of challenges, such as in West Africa and Gulf of Mexico. Presently, the steel catenary risers are used for deep water applications requiring large diameter pipes, and both the flexible and top-tensioned risers are used for shallow water applications. Current trend in the industry is the application of composite riser technology used mostly for deep waters, which have over 1000m depth.

Pre-bleaching reserve responses were consistent with a large literature, with higher coral cover, more species of fish, and greater fish biomass, particularly of upper trophic levels. However, in the 16 years following coral mortality, reserve effects were absent for the reef benthos, and greatly diminished for fish species richness. Positive fish biomass effects persisted, but the groups of fish benefiting from marine reserves profoundly changed, with low trophic level herbivores dominating the responses.

We used a time-series modelling approach to simultaneously evaluate the abundance, biomass, and traits of eight fish families over a chronosequence spanning 44 years of protection. We constructed a multivariate functional space based on six traits known to respond to management or disturbance and affect ecosystem processes: size, diet, position in the water column, gregariousness, reef association, and length at maturity. We show that biomass increased with a log-linear trend over the time-series, but abundance only increased after 20 years of closure, and with more variation among reserves. This difference is attributed to recovery rates being dependent on body sizes. Abundance-weighted traits and the associated multivariate space of the community change is driven by increased proportions over time of the trait categories: 7–15 cm body size; planktivorous; species low in the water column; medium-large schools; and species with high levels of reef association.

These habitats drive coastal productivity supporting our fisheries and other industries associated with recreation in marine environments, improve water quality, sequester carbon, protect shorelines from erosion, and support thriving biodiversity, including threatened species. These habitats are under pressure from coastal development, climate change, pollution, invasive species and other anthropogenic pressures, which have led to drastic declines in many of our important marine and coastal habitats.Under the division of powers between the Australian Government and the states under the Australian Constitution, states and territories have the primary responsibility for environmental protection of coastal habitats within three nautical miles of the coastline. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (C’th) (the EPBC Act) enables the Australian Federal Government to join with the states and territories in providing a national scheme of environment and heritage protection and biodiversity conservation. The EPBC Act focuses Australian Government interests on the protection of nine Matters of National Environmental Significance (MNES). These include World Heritage Areas and Ramsar wetlands, threatened and endangered species and habitats, and migratory species protected through international agreements, and Commonwealth Marine Areas.Given the current state of decline in natural ecosystems, there is a general consensus that there are two paths to conserve critical habitats; habitats can either be protected from extractive or destructive human influences (e.g. through national parks, marine reserves, fishery closures, gear restrictions or riparian conservation), and/or actively rehabilitated towards a preferred healthy state (i.e. restoration). Early environmental conservation was primarily focused on the former of these methods, with the establishment of national parks and conservation areas globally, and sector-based management of remaining pressures. However, despite these intensive interventions, many habitats have continued to decline over the past half century. There is increasing recognition that protection by itself is no longer sufficient and interest and demand for rehabilitation in the form of interventions and restoration has been growing. Restoration is now seen as a key element in achieving conservation and environmental management goals internationally. In recent decades, nations such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have embraced the need for large-scale marine and coastal restoration. Further, restoration also produces economic benefits. For example, restoration activities were recently estimated to contribute almost US$25 billion and 221,000 jobs annually to the United States economy.In this report we review the state of four ecologically critical coastal marine habitats in Australia; seagrass meadows, kelp forests, shellfish reefs, and coastal saltmarsh wetlands, and evaluate (1) the Commonwealth responsibility for the habitat under the EPBC Act, (2) capacity of habitat restoration to insulate against loss and degradation of MNES, through restoration of key habitats and the species they support, (3) recent advances in restoration with the potential to improve outcomes associated with MNES.This report demonstrates that each of the four habitats fall under up to six of the nine MNES, by being directly listed as or supporting threatened species or ecosystems, providing habitat for listed migratory species, and being important components of World Heritage Areas, Commonwealth waters, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and Ramsar wetlands. For example, giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forests are listed as an endangered ecological community; temperate and subtropical saltmarshes are listed as a vulnerable ecological community and three saltmarsh species are listed as vulnerable. In addition, the habitats formed by the two primary reef-forming oyster species are under consideration for listing as endangered ecological communities under the EPBC Act. Coastal saltmarshes provide critical habitat for listed threatened species, such as the green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) and the orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster), and migratory species such as the eastern curlew (Numenius madagascariensis), the Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva), the sharp-tailed sandpiper (Calidris acuminata), and the red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis). Seagrass habitats make up a large proportion of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area and support listed turtle species and dugong. Similarly, kelp forests support a disproportionately high number of endemic species, including several listed under the EPBC At, including the spotted handfish (Brachionichthys hirsutus, critically endangered), red handfish (Thymichthys politus, critically endangered), Ziebell’s handfish (Brachiopsilus ziebelli, vulnerable), black rockcod (Epinephelus daemelii, vulnerable) and members of the Syngnathidae family (seadragons, seahorses and pipefish).","Marine","University of Lancaster"

E.; Graham, N. A. J.","21/06/2021","Biological invasions pose a threat to nearly every ecosystem worldwide.1,2 Although eradication programs can successfully eliminate invasive species and enhance native biodiversity, especially on islands,3 the effects of eradication on cross-ecosystem processes are unknown. On islands where rats were never introduced, seabirds transfer nutrients from pelagic to terrestrial and nearshore marine habitats, which in turn enhance the productivity, biomass, and functioning of recipient ecosystems.4–6 Here, we test whether rat eradication restores seabird populations, their nutrient subsidies, and some of their associated benefits for ecosystem function to tropical islands and adjacent coral reefs. By comparing islands with different rat invasion histories, we found a clear hierarchy whereby seabird biomass, seabird-driven nitrogen inputs, and the incorporation of seabird-derived nutrients into terrestrial and marine food chains were highest on islands where rats were never introduced, intermediate on islands where rats were eradicated 4–16 years earlier, and lowest on islands with invasive rats still present. Seabird-derived nutrients diminished from land to sea and with increasing distance to rat-eradicated islands, but extended at least 300 m from shore. Although rat eradication enhanced seabird-derived nutrients in soil, leaves, marine algae, and herbivorous reef fish, reef fish growth was similar around rat-eradicated and rat-infested islands. Given that the loss of nutrient subsidies is of global concern,7 that removal of invasive species restores previously lost nutrient pathways over relatively short timescales is promising. However, the full return of cross-ecosystem nutrient subsidies and all of their associated demographic benefits may take multiple decades.  ","Marine","University of Lancaster"

V.","17/03/2022","In recent times, the utilisation of marine composites in tubular structures has grown in popularity. These applications include composite risers and related SURF (subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines) units. The composite industry has evolved in the development of advanced composites, such as thermoplastic composite pipes (TCP) and hybrid composite structures. However, there are gaps in the understanding of its performance in composite risers, hence the need for this review on the design, hydrodynamics and mechanics of composite risers. The review covers both the structure of the composite production riser (CPR) and its end-fittings for offshore marine applications. It also reviews the mechanical behaviour of composite risers, their microstructure and strength/stress profiles. In principle, designers now have a greater grasp of composite materials. It was concluded that composites differ from standard materials such as steel. Basically, composites have weight savings and a comparative stiffness-to-strength ratio, which are advantageous in marine composites. Also, the offshore sector has grown in response to newer innovations in composite structures such as composite risers, thereby providing new cost-effective techniques. This comprehensive review shows the necessity of optimising existing designs of composite risers. Conclusions drawn portray issues facing composite riser research. Recommendations were made to encourage composite riser developments, including elaboration of necessary standards and specifications.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

J.","01/2016","The legal establishment of protected areas is often associated with a situation of conflict arising between conservation and other human activities in particular spaces. This is primarily due to the fact that protected areas law requires changes in the behaviour of resource users. Conservation conflicts arising from the establishment of protected areas are well documented in the social science literature and attempts are made to find ways to reduce such conflicts. Yet, what of cases in which the establishment of protected areas serves to officialise existing sustainable practices and may contain an element of future proofing? Do they still generate practices of resistance and conflict? These questions are answered in this paper comparing two case studies where the authors conducted primary qualitative research: the designation of new Marine Conservation Zones under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 in the Isles of Scilly (South West of England) and the designation of a new Special Area of Conservation under Council Directive 92/43/EEC (the Habitats Directive) in Barra (Scottish Outer Hebrides). Both protected areas are highly unlikely to impose changes in local sea-users’ behaviour, as in both cases they validate existing practices and are future proofing, in the sense that they offer tools that can be used to minimize the effects of potential future shocks and stresses, presently unknown. Yet, while in Scilly the new Marine Conservation Zones have been perceived as a positive addition to the seascape, in Barra the Special Area of Conservation has been heavily contested by the local community. The islanders' different perspectives towards protected areas law can be described as divergent ‘legal consciousness’. ‘Legal consciousness’ is a socio-legal concept concerned with the ways in which the law is experienced, interpreted and re-shaped by ordinary people. In our case studies, legal consciousness is a dependent variable, being the product of three main causes: history, power relationships between regulators and regulatees and risk.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Based on empirical research conducted in England and Scotland, we argue that human geography is uniquely placed to offer effective solutions to marine resource management problems, and that geographers have the potential to offer key insights into how human populations can best interact with the living seas. Three of the most important current scholarly ‘imaginations’ of the sea, and the policies they inform (economics and market-based management, conservation biology and area based protection, and anthropology and community management), are outlined. A potential ‘geographical imagination’ of the sea, drawing on key themes in contemporary scholarship is then presented, and grounded in empirical research.

Trace elements analysed include Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, Ag and As. Sediments are contaminated with Zn, Cu, Ag, As and Pb, with levels in the <2m fraction that are likely to cause adverse biological effects to marine organisms. The pelite (<63m) is the main carrier of heavy metals at most sites. However, the fine-grained and coarse sand on the southern coast of Murano accounts for a significant proportion of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, Ag, Ni and Pb. Most trace element concentrations found in soft tissue of mussels appear to be within recommended Italian and international guidelines for shellfish for human consumption, the only exception being relatively high As levels. The bioaccumulation of Ag and Cr is more pronounced in the shell of these organisms.

The measurements were complimentary to similar ones made in the Austral summer during January–February 1995 and both sets of data are used to make a comparison of photochemistry in the remote marine boundary layer in summer and winter. Seasonal measurements of peroxy radicals are compared to both a steady-state analysis and a full model in order to elucidate their relationships to measured O3, Full-size image (<1 K) and H2O. Calculations of the seasonal concentrations and relationships of OH are consistent with both model and measurements. From a detailed analysis of the ozone budgets accounting for the contributions of photochemistry, deposition and entrainment processes, it is clear that on a seasonal basis there are two major controlling factors working in opposition. The net effect of photochemistry in the remote marine boundary layer is to destroy ozone; this is balanced by entrainment of ozone into the marine boundary layer from the lower free troposphere. Using the measured data, photochemistry represents the dominant loss process for ozone on a seasonal basis varying from 1.2 ppbv d−1 in summer (87% of the ozone loss) to 0.6 ppbv d−1 in the winter (64% of the ozone loss). It is clear that the level of photochemistry taking place in the marine boundary layer determines the lower bound for ozone levels.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

This allows it to show Britain’s diplomatic manoeuvres to simultaneously prevent provoking debilitating opposition against its tightrope policy of supporting Federal Nigeria against Biafra and safeguard its significant, predominantly economic – particularly oil – interests in Nigeria. Initially inconvenienced by the Nigerian request for a naval training team, British policymakers gradually agreed to send one after the war, then promised to do so already before, and, after the foreign policy establishment had overcome the Ministry of Defence’s resistance, finally sent out Royal Navy officers to Nigeria before the end of hostilities. In this process, the Nigerians had allies in the British High Commission in Lagos and the Foreign (and Commonwealth) Office, as well as substantial leverage as a result of Indian and Soviet competition in the Nigerian market for military assistance. Yet this leverage was mitigated by the Federals’ preference for British over Indian military assistance, and fear of becoming too reliant on Moscow. Not only in the British, but also in the Nigerian case, diplomatic concerns thus outweighed the military rationale for the naval training team, and this ‘diplomacy of military assistance’ contrasts with the basic tenor of the theoretical literature on military assistance in civil wars.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

The UK’s position, dubbed by the media the ‘let them drown’ policy, was that search and rescue constitutes a ‘pull factor’ for migration, and that withdrawing rescue patrols from the sea would deter migrants from attempting the journey. This chapter reviews the UK debate on the ‘let them drown’ policy and interprets its unveiling as the emergence of a new, openly anti-humanitarian model of border control. It argues that in order to understand how political agency and responsibility for such decisions is distributed within the polity, we must revisit, in terms of both theory and method, the relationship between the sites where conventional national and EU politics is exercised and the design and functioning of the EU border regime.

The angular distribution of neutrons from a thick lithium target is simulated and benchmarked against experimental data. Two-stage neutron production from laser-target experiments has been studied as a function of laser intensity and energy. During the first stage a well collimated deuteron beam is generated using a high-intensity ultrashort pulse laser. During the second stage it is transported through a lithium target using a 3D Monte-Carlo ion beam-target deposition model. The neutron yield is estimated to be similar to 10(8) neutrons J(-1) laser energy. Some 10(10) neutrons can be expected from a similar to 100 J petawatt-class laser. For incident deuteron energies above 1 MeV the proposed scheme for neutron production from d-Li reactions is superior to that from d-d reactions, producing a collimated beam of neutrons with higher neutron yield.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

The conventional ion acceleration mechanism, target normal sheath acceleration, has been revisited for targets with proton-rich contaminants in the form of water vapor. The targets considered have a deuterated plastic layer on the rear surface of an aluminum target, and the influence of the contaminant layer on the deuteron acceleration is investigated. In the early stage of ion acceleration, the space-charge electrostatic field on the rear target surface accelerates only the outermost, proton-rich layer of ions, which inhibits the deuteron acceleration by shielding it from the field. When the proton layer is depleted, the deuterons become exposed to the space-charge field and are promptly accelerated. This scenario was tested with a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation model by varying the contaminant layer thickness and laser fluence (laser energy per unit area). For laser fluences F(laser) <1 J/mu m(2), the contamination layer over the surface inhibits the deuteron acceleration from the rear surface, while in the opposite case of laser fluences F(laser) > 1 J/mu m(2) deuterons and heavier ions can be successfully accelerated with conversion efficiency of laser energy into ions of more than 1%. Experimental data from a 6 mu m thick aluminum foil coated with a 1 mu m deuterated plastic layer on the back surface are suggestive of the detrimental role of contaminants on deuteron acceleration.

D.","1/09/2017","Abstract The United States military is treating climate change as a crucial factor in its preparation for future conflicts. This concern manifests not only in strategic planning and forward-looking documents, but also in building infrastructural capacity and material provision. Yet, the impetus to ‘green’ the military goes beyond the deployment of existing technologies. We examine several facets of the military's role as an environmental actor, particularly through its promotion of the US Navy's ‘Great Green Fleet’ (GGF), which actively supports the development of advanced biofuels by subsidizing their development and facilitating wider marketization. The GGF promises to reduce military reliance on conventional fossil fuels and reconfigure its energy sourcing, thus reducing dependence on imported hydrocarbons; this is with an eye towards ultimately severing the logistical relationship between existing energy infrastructures and the spaces of military intervention. Taking an integrated lens of political ecology and geopolitics - ‘geopolitical ecology’ - we seek to provide an understanding of the production of weaponized nature. We demonstrate that the US military's discursive use of climate change to justify the provision of new military hardware and advanced biofuels promotes a vision of resource conflicts to support the development of technologies to overcome the constraints to delivery of fuel to emergent front lines. We argue that while this may appear to be militarized greenwashing, it signals a shift in the logics and practices of fuel sourcing driven by a dystopian vision of climate change, which the US military played a significant role in creating.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

For laser intensities in the range of (1-3) x 10(19) W cm(-2), it was found that the bulk targets produced a high yield (5 x 10(4) neutrons per steradian) beamed preferentially in the laser propagation direction. Numerical modeling shows the importance of considering the temperature adjusted stopping powers to correctly model the neutron production. The bulk CD targets have a high background target temperature leading to a reduced stopping power for the deuterons, which increases the probability of generating neutrons by fusion. Neutron production from the pitcher-catcher targets was not as efficient since it does not benefit from the reduced stopping power in the cold catcher target. Also, the inhibition of the deuteron acceleration by a proton rich contamination layer significantly reduces the pitcher-catcher neutron production. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

J.; Senior, A.","11/08/2015","Observations of secondary radiation, stimulated electromagnetic emission (SEE), produced during ionospheric modification experiments using ground-based, highpower, high-frequency (HF) radio waves are considered. The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facility is capable of generating narrowband SEE in the form of stimulated Brillouin scatter (SBS) and stimulated ion Bernstein scatter (SIBS) in the SEE spectrum. Such narrowband SEE spectral lines have not been reported using the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) heater facility before. This work reports the first EISCAT results of narrowband SEE spectra and compares them to SEE previously observed at HAARP during electron gyro-harmonic heating. An analysis of experimental SEE data shows observations of emission lines within 100 Hz of the pump frequency, interpreted as SBS, during the 2012 July EISCAT campaign. Experimental results indicate that SBS strengthens as the pump frequency approaches the third electron gyro-harmonic. Also, for different heater antenna beam angles, the CUTLASS radar backscatter induced by HF radio pumping is suppressed near electron gyro-harmonics, whereas electron temperature enhancement weakens as measured by EISCAT/UHF radar. The main features of these new narrowband EISCAT observations are generally consistent with previous SBS measurements at HAARP.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

D.","05/2009","Imaging of the heliosphere is a burgeoning area of research. As a result, it is awash with new results, using novel applications, and is demonstrating great potential for future research in a wide range of topical areas. The STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory) Heliospheric Imager (HI) instruments are at the heart of this new development, building on the pioneering observations of the SMEI (Solar Mass Ejection Imager) instrument aboard the Coriolis spacecraft. Other earlier heliospheric imaging systems have included ground-based interplanetary scintillation (IPS) facilities and the photometers on the Helios spacecraft. With the HI instruments, we now have routine wide-angle imaging of the inner heliosphere, from vantage points outside the Sun-Earth line. HI has been used to investigate the development of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as they pass through the heliosphere to 1 AU and beyond. Synoptic mapping has also allowed us to see graphic illustrations of the nature of mass outflow as a function of distance from the Sun - in particular, stressing the complexity of the near-Sun solar wind. The instruments have also been used to image co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs), to study the interaction of comets with the solar wind and CMEs, and to witness the impact of CMEs and CIRs on planets. The very nature of this area of research - which brings together aspects of solar physics, space-environment physics, and solar-terrestrial physics - means that the research papers are spread among a wide range of journals from different disciplines. Thus, in this special issue, it is timely and appropriate to provide a review of the results of the first two years of the HI investigations.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

The 3-D propagation path of the largest interplanetary CME (ICME) is determined from the observations made by the SECCHI Heliospheric Imager (HI) on STEREO-A (HI-1/2A). Two parts of the CME are tracked through the SECCHI images, a bright loop and a V-shaped feature located at the rear of the event. We show that these two structures could be the result of line-of-sight integration of the light scattered by electrons located on a single flux rope. In addition to being imaged by HI, the CME is observed simultaneously by the plasma and magnetic field experiments on the Venus Express and MESSENGER spacecraft. The imaged loop and V-shaped structure bound, as expected, the flux rope observed in situ. The SECCHI images reveal that the leading loop-like structure propagated faster than the V-shaped structure, and a decrease in in situ CME speed occurred during the passage of the flux rope. We interpret this as the result of the continuous radial expansion of the flux rope as it progressed outward through the interplanetary medium. An expansion speed in the radial direction of similar to 30 km s(-1) is obtained directly from the SECCHI-HI images and is in agreement with the difference in speed of the two structures observed in situ. This paper shows that the flux rope location can be determined from white light images, which could have important space weather applications.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

For laser pulses with intensity 3 x 10(21) W/cm(2), duration 32 fs, focal spot size 5 mu m, and energy 27 J, the calculated reflection, transmission, and coupling coefficients from a 20 nm foil are 80%, 5%, and 15%, respectively.

The forward accelerated gold ions have average and maximum charge-to-mass ratio of 0.25 and 0.3, respectively, maximum normalized energy 25MeV/nucleon, and flux 2 x 10(11) ions/sr. An analytical model was used to determine a range of foil thicknesses suitable for acceleration of gold ions in the radiation pressure acceleration regime and the onset of the target normal sheath acceleration regime. The numerical simulations and analytical model point to at least four technical challenges hindering the heavy ion acceleration: low charge-to-mass ratio, limited number of ions amenable to acceleration, delayed acceleration, and high reflectivity of the plasma. Finally, a regime suitable for heavy ion acceleration has been identified in an alternative approach by analyzing the energy absorption and distribution among participating species and scaling of conversion efficiency, maximum energy, and flux with laser intensity.

By varying the laser pulse duration we observe a transition from radiation pressure acceleration (RPA) to the relativistic induced transparency (RIT) regime for heavy ions akin to light ions. The underlying physics of beam formation and acceleration is similar for light and heavy ions, however, nuances of the acceleration process make the heavy ions more challenging. A more detailed study involving variation of peak laser intensity I-0 and pulse duration tau(FWHM) revealed that the transition point from RPA to RIT regime depends on the peak laser intensity on target and occurs for pulse duration tau(RPA -> RIT)(FWHM) [fs] congruent to 210/root I-0 [W cm (2)]/10(21) The most abundant gold ion and charge-to-mass ratio are Au51+ and q/M approximate to 1/4, respectively, half that of light ions.

Edwardian postcard writing is a genre with a specific, distinct relation to letter writing, yet closely entwined with that practice. The word ‘revolution’ is often over-used but is surely appropriate to postcards in the decades of the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries, when their multifunctionality vastly exceeded that of the holiday postcard of more recent times.  Developed in Austria in 1869, the postcard was very quickly adopted across Europe by people across all social classes.  In cities there were several deliveries a day, so that cards could be experienced as virtually synchronous. In 1896 The Times declared, “Now the postcard is the letter of the poor.”  In 1902 illustrations were introduced.  Untrammelled by the etiquette and obligations of formal letter writing, people took to exchanging brief, rapid, multimodal messages with a verve not to be seen again until the digital revolution.  In this paper I explore postcard writing from a Literacy Studies perspective (Barton & Hall, 2000; Barton, 2007).  I combine textual and material analyses with an investigation of historical sources, including census records, to deepen sociocultural understandings (Gillen, 2013).  I focus on a case study of one set of correspondence, between a typist whose transient homes revolved around the Caledonian Market cattle market, and a stoker in the Navy. Through exploring the correspondence of Ruby Ingrey and Arthur Waddelow I demonstrate the opportunities and limitations of taking a Literacy Studies approach to researching this multimodal epistolary genre.Barton, D. & Hall, N.

The first beam will accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. The second beam will subject relativistic electrons to the strong electromagnetic field generating QED processes: intense gamma ray radiation and electron-positron pair formation. The laser beams will be focused to intensities above 10(21) Wcm(-2) and reaching 10(22)-10(23) Wcm(-2) for the first time. We propose to use this capability to investigate new physical phenomena at the interfaces of plasma, nuclear and particle physics at ELI-NP. This High Power Laser System Technical Design Report (HPLS-TDR2) presents the experimental area E6 at ELI-NP for investigating high field physics and quantum electrodynamics and the production of electron-positron-pairs and of energetic gamma-rays. The scientific community submitted 12 commissioning runs for E6 interaction chamber with two 10 PW laser beams and one proposal for the CETAL interaction chamber with 1 PW laser. The proposals are representative of the international high field physics community being written by 48 authors from 14 European and US organizations. The proposals are classified according to the science area investigated into: Radiation Reaction Physics: Classical and Quantum; Compton and Thomson Scattering Physics: Linear and Non Linear Regimes; QED in Vacuum; Atoms in Extreme Fields. Two pump-probe colliding 10 PW laser beams are proposed for the E6 interaction chamber. The focused pump laser beam accelerates the electrons to relativistic energies. The accelerated electron bunches interact with the very high electro-magnetic field of the focused probe laser beam. We propose two main types of experiments with: (a) gas targets in which the pump laser-beam is focused by a long focal length mirror and drives a wakefield in which the electron bunch is accelerated to multi-GeV energies and then exposed to the EM field of the probe laser which is tightly focused; (b) solid targets in which both the pump and probe laser beams are focused on the solid target, one accelerating the electrons in the solid and the other, delayed, providing the high electric field to which the relativistic electrons are subjected. We propose four main focusing configurations for the pump and probe laser beams, two for each type of target: counter-propagating 10 PW focused laser beams and the two 10 PW laser beams focused in the same direction. For solid targets we propose an additional configuration with plasma-mirror on the pump laser beam: the plasma mirror placed between the focusing mirror and target. It is proposed that the 10 PW laser beams will have polarization control and focus control by means of adaptive optics. Initially only one 10 PW may have polarization control and adaptive optics. In order to accommodate the two laser beams and diagnostics the proposed interaction chamber is quasi-octagonal with a diameter of 4.5 m. A large electron-spectrometer is proposed for multi-GeV electrons. Other diagnostics are requested for: gamma-rays, electrons and positrons, protons and ions, plasma characterization, transmitted and reflected laser beam.

As such, maritime strategy - the direction of elements of national power (including naval power, in particular) to secure national interests at sea - remains a vital subject. Just as there are principles of military strategy, so too are there principles of maritime strategy.However, these principles have their roots in the thinking of scholars from as far back as the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Alfred Thayer Mahan and Sir Julian Corbett. Yet the political, strategic and technological environments have changed a lot since those periods, with the current context marked by advancements in information and communications technologies and their associated political and strategic ramifications.This thesis asks how the principles of maritime strategy have evolved as times have changed. In particular, it focuses upon how they deal with 'visibility' - a triad consisting of knowledge, perception and interpretation. These have always been important to navies, yet the principles arguably say little about them. This thesis then ultimately aims to assess whether a new principle, control and/or denial of visibility, can be useful as a means of filling this gap.This thesis therefore contributes to the literature and discussion of maritime strategy not only by assessing traditional concepts, but also by assessing the extent of this gap in their definitions. Furthermore, it will assess whether a new principle is useful in filling this gap. The main finding is that, despite some evolutions in how they are conceived, the traditional principles only account for visibility to a limited extent, making a new principle of control and/or denial of visibility useful.","Navy","University of Lancaster"
"Prevalence and risk factors of HIV infection among people who inject drugs in Cambodia: findings from a national survey","https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/prevalence-and-risk-factors-of-hiv-infection-among-people-who-inject-drugs-in-cambodia(5d444191-967b-40c6-ad28-e99c5deaa424).html","Mburu, G.","17/10/2019","BACKGROUND: Globally, people who inject drugs (PWID) continue to be among the most vulnerable populations to acquire infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The most recent national survey found that nearly a quarter of PWID in Cambodia were infected with HIV in 2012. The aim of this study is to estimate the current prevalence of and factors associated with HIV infection among PWID in Cambodia. METHODS: This national integrated biological and behavioral survey was conducted from June to December 2017. Participants were recruited from the capital city and 11 major provinces using the respondent driven sampling method. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire, and blood samples were collected for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors for HIV infection. All analyses were estimated with sampling weights that corrected for non-response and sample design. RESULTS: A total of 310 PWID participated in the study, and the mean age was 31.8 years (SD = 7.8). The prevalence of HIV was 15.2%. More than half (57.4%) of the HIV-positive participants were co-infected with HCV, and 44.7% were not aware of their HIV status prior to this study. After adjustment for other covariates, HIV infection remained positively associated with being female (AOR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.03-4.04), being in the older age group of ≥35 (AOR = 2.99, 95% CI 1.33-9.22), being widowed, divorced or separated (AOR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.04-6.67), living on the streets (AOR = 2.86, 95% CI 1.24-4.37), and HCV infection (AOR = 3.89, 95% CI 1.86-1.15). The HIV infection remained negatively associated with having higher level of formal education of ≥10 years (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.13-0.83) and higher average income of ≥US$200 per month (AOR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.05-0.74). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HIV among PWID in Cambodia remains high, but is reducing compared with the 24.8% reported in the 2012 national survey. Findings from this study provide critical information for tailoring interventions based on identified vulnerabilities and risk factors for HIV. Our findings underline the importance of socio-structural factors in HIV epidemiology among PWID in Cambodia, which require mitigation.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

However, obscuring functions and the incognito collection of data is profitable for companies (Bryson and Winfield, 2017; Mosco, 2014).

We are currently gathering research through workshops, enabling us to test the rigour and disrupt the current iteration of iconography to provoke further iterations. The participants of the workshop complete game-like tasks using cards, which depict the icons and their associated text labels separately, as a medium to engage—in a tangible manner—the intangible and functions of these technologies. We have already had success in participants using with ease our initial iconography system, while also highlighting and exposing icons of interest; which are worth further research and discussion.","Ai","University of Lancaster"

However, we argue here that this overlooks the important part played by organisational accountability in how people reason about and trust AI in socio-technical settings. To illustrate the importance of organisational accountability, we present findings from ethnographic studies of breast cancer screening and cancer treatment planning in multidisciplinary team meetings to show how participants made themselves accountable both to each other and to the organisations of which they are members. We use these findings to enrich existing understandings of the requirements for trustworthy AI and to outline some candidate solutions to the problems of making AI accountable both to individual users and organisationally. We conclude by outlining the implications of this for future work on the development of trustworthy AI, including ways in which our proposed solutions may be re-used in different application settings.","Ai","University of Lancaster"

There has been also a growth of commercial AI-based mobile appsfor mental health. Despite emerging HCI work on reviewing mental health apps, those that are AI- based have received limited attention. To address this gap, we report a functionality review of 13 such apps selected from 127 apps from the Apple Store. Findings indicate that apps support functions such as tracking and detecting emotions and moods, providing recommendations for therapy and well-being interventions, and supporting talking therapy through conversational agents powered by NLP models. A critical finding is apps’ limited support for AI literacy and explainability, as well as limited consideration for ethical concerns regarding personal data, its reliability, and algorithmic biases.

Design-led research can play a key role in exploring this challenge. Applying Research through Design (RtD) this paper explores AI legibility in three ways: (1) explaining why it makes sense to address AI legibility with design; (2) the presentation of prototypical icons designed to enhance AI legibility; (3) experimenting with how the icons may be used in the context of signage relating to potential applications of AI.

Such efforts run the risk of formalizing a distinctly privileged perspective on trustworthiness which is insensitive (or else indifferent) to the legitimate reasons for distrust held by marginalized people. By exploring a neglected conative element of trust, we broaden understandings of trust and trustworthiness to make sense of, and identify principles for responding productively to, distrust of ostensibly ‘trustworthy’ AI. Bringing social science scholarship into dialogue with AI criticism, we show that AI is being used to construct a digital underclass that is rhetorically labelled as ‘undeserving’, and highlight how this process fulfills functions for more privileged people and institutions. We argue that distrust of AI is warranted and healthy when the AI contributes to marginalization and structural violence, and that Trustworthy AI may fuel public resistance to the use of AI unless it addresses this dimension of untrustworthiness. To this end, we offer reformulations of core principles ofTrustworthy AI—fairness, accountability, and transparency—that substantively address the deeper issues animating widespread public distrust of AI, including: stewardship and care, openness and vulnerability, and humility and empowerment. In light of evidence of strong and legitimate reasons for distrust, we call on the field to to re-evaluate why the public would embrace the expansion of AI into all corners of society; in short, what makes it worthy of their trust.","Ai","University of Lancaster"

This article argues that China’s search for AI leadership is driven by not only domestic regulatory needs but also the desire to gain norm and agenda setting power. China’s leadership ambition in global AI governance lies in the wider context of its aspiration to shift from a norm-taker towards a norm-shaper, if not maker. Despite considerable efforts taken so far, however, this article suggests that China is facing enormous challenges to realize its leadership ambition.

Every detail of this portrayal was an exercise in World Building, with careful considerations of then state-of-the-art technology and informed predictions. Kubrick’s speculative vision is comparative to the practice of Design Fiction, by suspending disbelief and leveraging a technologies emergence to question the future’s sociotechnical landscape and its ramifications critically. Discovery’s AI system, Hal9000, is a convincing speculation of intelligence with Kubrick’s vision showcasing current and long-term aims in AI research. To this end, Hal9000 uniquely portrays Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) underpinned by visualising ‘narrow’ AI subproblems; thereby, simultaneously highlighting then current research agendas within AI and manifesting them into the aspirational research agenda of human-computer symbiosis. As a result of Kubrick’s mastery in suspending a viewer’s disbelief despite portraying a particular reality for AI, and humanities fascination with artificial life, the term AI simultaneously refers to the grand vision of AGI as well as relating to the contemporary reality of narrow AI. This confusion, along with establishing AI’s ontology, are current challenges that need addressing to create effective and acceptable realisations of AI. This paper responds to the ontological confusion by reviewing and comparing Kubrick’s speculative methodology to the practice of Design Fiction by unpacking Hal9000 as a diegetic prototype while defining the active threads of ‘AI’s Definitional Dualism’. The paper will also present a Design Fiction submerged in the reality of narrow AI and the adoption of a More-Than Human Centred Design approach to address the complexity of AI’s ontology in alternative ways.

In parallel, developments in pervasive computing increasingly enable us to instrument our physical environment with complex sensors and actuators and create an interconnected world that generates huge volumes of data. The importance of these trends can be seen in the growing momentum of exemplars such as the Internet of Things (IoT), smart environments, and augmented cognition. Pervasive data science is characterized by a focus on the collection, analysis (inference), and use of data (actuation) in pursuit of the vision of ubiquitous computing1 and raises multiple new challenges, demanding new approaches to how we capture, process, and use data in pervasive environments. Beyond the hype, it is clear that our world is becoming increasingly data centric, in which both physical and electronic services depend on the collection, analysis, and application of large volumes of heterogeneous data.

We all know that actually most security primitives are based on hard math problems, such as integer factorisation and discrete logarithm, but in 2003, using hard AI problems for security purposes was proposed at CMU. Everyone knows that Captcha is the most successful example. The research question we have asked is very simple: what else can we invent along this line? Can we do anything else in security primitives based on hard AI problems?My next slide, which some people in this audience have seen before, is taken from a talk I gave at a Cambridge Security Seminar in 2007. At the time I was busy designing a new graphical password scheme, which is now known as Background Draw A Secret. I had a look at a popular graphical password scheme, which is called PassPoints. In this scheme basically each user has an image, you click five points on this image, and derive your password. Apparently you can apply image processing techniques to automatically grab all those salient points, those eye-catching points. Therefore, if you do a random combination of those salient points you effectively do a brute-force attack on the passwords. And in this system, because multiple users will use the same image to create and enter their passwords, some salient points are more popular than others, therefore they lead to ‘hotspots’. If the hotspots are detected then you effectively can launch a very successful dictionary attack to break PassPoints. The attack was demonstrated in two papers, one at USENIX Security’07 and the other at SOUPS’07.","Ai","University of Lancaster"

It has given the United States a first-mover advantage, establishing precedents that other global actors need to comply with, negotiate or resist. The article advances three arguments. One, the community has long recognized that it needs to collaborate with the tech sector on AI. However, these relationships bring certain challenges since the sector is a curious compound of ideologies and interests. Two, while the community was initially attracted to the data processing advantages of AI to help human analysts to overcome “data smog,” today it has broadened its focus to consider how AI can improve all stages of the intelligence cycle. Three, while many voices feverishly herald the transformative potential of AI in the global security environment, we argue instead that US agencies will not be able to exploit the full potential of AI, and thus talk of an intelligence revolution is premature.","Ai","University of Lancaster"

On-Device intelligence promises the possibility of computing huge amounts of data close to its source, e.g., sensor and multimedia data. By doing so, devices can complement their counterpart cloud services with more sophisticated functionality to provide better applications and services. However, increased computational capabilities of smart devices, wearables and IoT devices along with the emergence of services at the Edge of the network are driving the trend of migrating and distributing computation between devices. Indeed, devices can reduce the burden of executing resource intensive tasks via collaborations in the wild. While several work has shown the benefits of an opportunistic collaboration of a device with others, not much is known regarding how devices can be organized as a group as they move together. In this paper, we contribute by analyzing how dynamic group organization of devices can be utilized to distribute intelligence on the moving Edge. The key insight is that instead of On-Device solutions complementing with cloud, dynamic groups can be formed to complement each other in an On-Multi-Device manner. Thus, we highlight the challenges and opportunities from extending the scope of On-Device AI from an egocentric view to a collaborative, multi-device view.","Ai","University of Lancaster"

AI is increasingly used in public administration with the promise of improving decision-making through predictive modelling. To accurately predict, it needs all the agreed criteria used as part of decisions, formal and informal. This paper empirically explores the informal classifications used by caseworkers to make unemployed welfare seekers 'fit' into the formal categories applied in a Danish job centre. Our findings show that these classifications are documentable, and hence traceable to AI. However, to the caseworkers, they are at odds with the stable explanations assumed by any bureaucratic recording system as they involve negotiated and situated judgments of people's character. Thus, for moral reasons, caseworkers find them ill-suited for formal representation and predictive purposes and choose not to write them down. As a result, although classification work is crucial to the job centre's activities, AI is denuded of the real-world (and real work) character of decision-making in this context. This is an important finding for CSCW as it is not only about whether AI can 'do' decision-making in particular contexts, as previous research has argued. This paper shows that problems may also be caused by people's unwillingness to provide data to systems. It is the purpose of this paper to present the empirical results of this research, followed by a discussion of implications for AI-supported practice and research.","Ai","University of Lancaster"

We describe the pivotal role of externally auditable AI documentation within this model and the work to be done to ensure it is effective, and outline a number of actions that would promote public trust in AI. We discuss how existing efforts to develop AI documentation within organizations---both to inform potential adopters of AI components and support the deliberations of risk and ethics review boards---is necessary but insufficient assurance of the trustworthiness of AI.

This paper considers the existing EU liability framework and concludes that, at present, it is not adequate to ensure that injured parties can be compensated for damage caused by AI. The argument presented is that Product Liability Directive 85/374/EEC should be amended to provide greater protection for claimants that suffer harm caused by AI, and proposals for revision are suggested.

As a response to these concerns there has been a concentrated effort from public bodies, policy-makers and technology companies leading the way in AI to address what is identified as a ""public trust deficit"". This paper argues that a focus on trust as the basis upon which a relationship between this new technology and the public is built is, at best, ineffective, at worst, inappropriate or even dangerous, as it diverts attention from what is actually needed to actively warrant trust. Instead of agonising about how to facilitate trust, a type of relationship which can leave those trusting vulnerable and exposed, we argue that efforts should be focused on the difficult and dynamic process of ensuring reliance underwritten by strong legal and regulatory frameworks. From there, trust could emerge but not merely as a means to an end. Instead, as something to work in practice towards; that is, the deserved result of an ongoing ethical relationship where there is the appropriate, enforceable and reliable regulatory infrastructure in place for problems, challenges and power asymmetries to be continuously accounted for and appropriately redressed.","Ai","University of Lancaster"
