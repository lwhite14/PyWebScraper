"The nature and extent of evidence on methodologies for monitoring and evaluating marine spatial management measures in the UK and similar coastal waters : a systematic map.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/176484/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Copping, Joshua; Mukherjee, Nibedita","May 2021","Background Anthropogenic degradation of marine ecosystems is widely accepted as a major social-ecological problem. The growing urgency to manage marine ecosystems more effectively has led to increasing application of spatial management measures (marine protected areas [MPAs], sectoral [e.g. fishery] closures and marine spatial planning [marine plans]). Understanding the methodologies used to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures against social, economic, and ecological outcomes is key for designing effective monitoring and evaluation programmes. Methods We used a pre-defined and tested search string focusing on intervention and outcome terms to search for relevant studies across four bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, 39 organisational websites, and one specialist data repository. Searches were conducted in English and restricted to the period 2009 to 2019 to align with current UK marine policy contexts. Relevant studies were restricted to UK-relevant coastal countries, as identified by key stakeholders. Search results were screened for relevance against pre-defined eligibility criteria first at title and abstract level, and then at full text. Articles assessed as not relevant at full text were recorded with reasons for exclusion. Two systematic map databases of meta-data and coded data from relevant primary and secondary studies, respectively, were produced. Review findings Over 19,500 search results were identified, resulting in 391 relevant primary articles, 33 secondary articles and 49 tertiary reviews. Relevant primary articles evaluated spatial management measures across a total of 22 social, economic and ecological outcomes; only 2.8% considered all three disciplines, with most focused exclusively on ecological (67.8%) or social (13.3%) evaluations. Secondary articles predominately focused on ecological evaluations (75.8%). The majority of the primary and secondary evidence base aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of MPAs (85.7% and 90.9% respectively), followed by fisheries closures (12.5%; 3.0%) with only 1.8% of primary, and 6.1% of secondary, articles focused on marine plans or on MPAs and fisheries closures combined. Most evaluations reported within primary articles were conducted for a single site (60.4%) or multiple individual sites (32.5%), with few evaluating networks of sites (6.9%). Secondary articles mostly evaluated multiple individual sites (93.9%). Most (70.3%) primary articles conducted principal evaluations, i.e. basic description of effects; 29.4% explored causation; and 0.3% undertook benefit evaluations. Secondary articles predominately explored causation (66.7%) with the remainder conducting principal evaluations. Australia (27.4%), the USA (18.4%) and the UK (11.3%) were most frequently studied by primary articles, with secondary articles reporting mostly global (66.7%) or European (18.2%) syntheses. Conclusions The systematic map reveals substantial bodies of evidence relating to methods of evaluating MPAs against ecological outcomes. However, key knowledge gaps include evaluation across social and economic outcomes and of overall merit and/or worth (benefit evaluation), as well as of: marine plans; networks of sites; real-time, temporary or seasonal closures; spatial management within offshore waters, and lagoon or estuary environments. Although the evidence base has grown over the past two decades, information to develop comprehensive evaluation frameworks remains insufficient. Greater understanding on how to evaluate the effectiveness of spatial management measures is required to support improved management of global ocean resources and spaces.","Marine","University of York"

"A drowned Mesolithic shell midden complex at Hjarnø Vesterhoved,Denmark and its wider significance.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/172405/","Moe Astrup, Peter; Benjamin, Jonathan; Stankiewicz, Francis","February 2021","Anthropogenic shell accumulations (shell middens), often of great size, occur in their tens of thousands around the world’s coastlines. They mostly date from the Mid-Holocene onwards and are frequently taken as symptomatic of a Postglacial ‘revolution’ involving world-wide population growth and intensification in exploitation of marine resources. However, the comparative rarity of earlier deposits may have as much to do with Postglacial sea-level rise and the loss of evidence from earlier palaeoshorelines as with genuine socio-economic trends. Here we investigate the underwater Mesolithic (Ertebølle) shellmidden of Hjarnø Vesterhoved in Denmark, one of the first underwater shell middens to be systematically verified as an anthropogenic shell deposit in a region world-famous for its many hundreds of Ertebølle shell mounds on the present shoreline. We show how a combination of geophysical survey, coring, excavation, stratigraphic interpretation and macroscopic analysis of midden contents can be used to identify underwater deposits, to unravel their taphonomic and post-depositional history in relation to surrounding sediments, and to distinguish between cultural and natural agencies of shell accumulation and deformation. We demonstrate the presence of an intact underwater shell-midden deposit dated at 5400–5100 cal BC, one of the earliest in Denmark. We demonstrate the usefulness of such material in giving new information about early coastal subsistence economies and greater precision to the measurement of palaeosea levels. We discuss the implications of our results for an improved understanding of the Mesolithic record in Denmark and of biases in the archaeological record of Late Pleistocene and Early-to-Mid-Holocene coastal contexts. We emphasise the importance of researching more fully the geomorphological and taphonomic processes that affect the accumulation, destruction, burial, preservation and visibility of underwater archaeological deposits, the need to extend underwater investigations more widely and to more deeply submerged palaeoshorelines, and the combination of methods required to advance such investigations.","Marine","University of York"
"Characteristics of shallow and mesophotic environments of the Pemba Channel, Tanzania : implications for management and conservation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/168877/","Edeye, Kennedy Osuka; McClean, Colin John; Stewart, Bryce Donald","November 2020","Information on the spatial distribution of habitats and vulnerable species is important for conservation planning. In particular, detailed knowledge on connectivity of marine ecosystems in relation to depth and seafloor characteristics is crucial for any proposed conservation and management actions. Yet, the bulk of the seafloor remains undersampled, unstudied and unmapped, thereby limiting our understanding of connections between shallow and deep-water communities. Recent studies on mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) have highlighted the western Indian Ocean as a particularly understudied marine region. Here we utilise an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to collect in-situ temperature, oxygen concentration, bathymetry, acoustic backscatter and photographic data on benthic communities from shallow (<30 m) and mesophotic (30-150 m) depths at selected sites in the Greater Pemba Channel, Tanzania . Further, we use generalised additive models (GAMs) to determine useful predictors of substratum (hard and sand) and benthic community type (coral, turf algae, fleshy algae, fish). Our results revealed the presence of a complex seafloor characterised by pockmarks, steep slopes, submarine walls, and large boulders. Photographs confirmed the presence of MCE composed of corals, algae and fishes on the eastern margins of the Pemba Channel. The GAMs on the presence and absence of benthic community explained 35% to 91% of the deviance in fish and fleshy algae assemblages, respectively. Key predictors of the distribution of hard substrata and the coral reef communities were depth, showing the upper boundary of MCEs present at 30-40 m, and seafloor slope that showed more occurrences on steep slopes. The upper 100 m of water column had stable temperatures (25-26°C) and oxygen concentrations (220- 235 μmol/l). We noted the presence of submarine walls, steeply inclined bedrock, which appeared to support a highly bio-diverse community that may be worthy of particular conservation measures. Our results also highlight the capability of using marine robotics, particularly autonomous vehicles, to fill the knowledge gap for areas not readily accessible with surface vessels, and their potential application in the initial survey and subsequent monitoring of Marine Protected Areas.","Marine","University of York"
"Age-estimate evidence for a complex Middle to Late Pleistocene fluvial terrace aggradation spanning more than a 100-kyr interglacial–glacial cycle at Sutton Cross, eastern England.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/165436/","Langford, H. E.; Griffiths, H.; Horne, D. J.","September 2020","At Sutton Cross, eastern England, an undated River Nene 2nd Terrace was known to record a complex sequence of late Middle to Upper Pleistocene deposits. Amino acid geochronology was carried out for samples from four separate facies associations in order to provide a chronostratigraphic framework for this complex deposit. Each sample comprised three specimens of Bithynia tentaculata opercula. The intracrystalline protein decomposition results confirmed the sedimentary stratigraphic interpretation previously proposed for the site, i.e., that fossiliferous sediments yielding fully temperate Mollusca and Ostracoda faunas are equivalent in age to marine isotope stage (MIS) 7. Palaeotemperature reconstructions based on the Ostracoda fauna (July: +14 to +26 °C; January: ―4 to +5/+3 °C) embrace those of today at this location (July: +17 °C; January +3 °C). The sedimentary succession at Sutton Cross comprises vertically aggraded packages with a probable maximum age of MIS 8 and minimum age of MIS 2. This aggradation pattern (and age range) is also common to downstream sedimentary successions at Whittlesey, and is counterintuitive to the traditional terrace stratigraphy approach that expects laterally aggrading downstepping packages. The preservation of sediments of MIS 7 age and older at Sutton Cross with no evidence of glacial overriding places constraints on recently proposed late Middle Pleistocene regional ice limits.","Marine","University of York"
"The Effects of Aquaculture and Marine Conservation on Cultural Ecosystem Services : An Integrated Hedonic – Eudaemonic Approach.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/175181/","Spanou, Elisavet; Kenter, Jasper O.; Graziano, Marcello","June 2020","Understanding the cultural contributions of ecosystems is essential for recognising how environmental policy impacts on human well-being. We developed an integrated cultural ecosystem services (CES) valuation approach involving non-monetary valuation through a eudaemonic well-being questionnaire and monetary valuation through hedonic pricing. This approach was applied to assess CES values on the west coast of Scotland. The impact of scenic area and marine protected area (MPA) designations on CES values and potential trade-offs with aquaculture, an increasingly important provisioning ecosystem service in the region, were investigated. Results confirmed a eudaemonic well-being value structure of seven factors: engagement and interaction with nature, place identity, therapeutic value, spiritual value, social bonds, memory/transformative value, and challenge and skill. Visibility of, but not proximity to aquaculture negatively influenced housing prices. In contrast, proximity to MPAs and visibility of scenic areas increased property values. All eudaemonic well-being value factors were positively and significantly associated with scenic areas and a subset of these with MPAs. The integration of the two methods can provide decision-makers with a more comprehensive picture of CES values, their relation to conservation policies and interactions and trade-offs with other activities and services.","Marine","University of York"
"Integrating stakeholder knowledge through modular cooperative participatory processes for marine spatial planning outcomes (CORPORATES).","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/191740/","Slater, Anne Michelle; Irvine, Katherine N.; Byg, Anja A.","May 2020","Management of the sea is increasingly complex, riddled with uncertainty and necessitates involvement from researchers across disciplines and stakeholders from multiple policy and practice sectors. This article discusses “The Cooperative Participatory Evaluation of Renewable Technologies on Ecosystem Services” (CORPORATES) research project, which developed an innovative and practical method of linking ecological processes, ecosystem services and benefits. The research was conducted in the context of licensing decisions for offshore wind farms in the North Sea (Scotland, UK). A set of linked, modular participatory processes were developed to foster cross-sector stakeholder engagement. It employed an exchange of ecological, legal, social, economic and cultural knowledge around marine ecosystem services. Workshop exercises included participatory mapping, benefit identification, and developing an understanding of linkages between ecosystem services, benefits, stakeholders’ activities and policy drivers through co-development of conceptual systems maps of the study area. The participatory exercises fostered meaningful dialogue across sectors and an ability to participate equally, despite initial differences in knowledge about ecosystem services. The development of conceptual systems maps facilitated productive discussion about trade-offs in relation to different policies. Reflective discussion identifies ways in which the developed processes could be integrated into future decision making. An assessment of the approach revealed that it operationalised a post normal science framework in terms of process oversight, multiple knowledge claims, and managing uncertainty. It developed a process that linked understanding of ecosystem functioning with the creation and implementation of policy thereby creating an ecosystem approach to marine spatial planning and licensing decisions, as required by law. This approach has extensive transferability to situations where stakeholder engagement is required to develop policy and provide feedback as part of a decision-making process. It is an engagement, outreach tool for communities and can help teach methods and processes for stakeholder engagement which enable new insights.","Marine","University of York"
"Emerging themes to support ambitious UK marine biodiversity conservation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/158671/","Rees, Sian E.; Sheehan, Emma V.; Stewart, Bryce Donald","February 2020","Healthy marine ecosystems provide a wide range of resources and services that support life on Earth and contribute to human wellbeing. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are accepted as an important tool for the restoration and maintenance of marine ecosystem structure, function, health and ecosystem integrity through the conservation of significant species, habitats, or entire ecosystems. In recent years there has been a rapid expansion in the area of ocean designated as an MPA. Despite this progress in spatial protection targets and the progressive knowledge of the essential interdependence between the human and the ocean system, marine biodiversity continues to decline, placing in jeopardy the range of ecosystem services benefits humans rely on. There is a need to address this shortcoming. Ambitious marine conservation: • Requires a shift from managing individual marine features within MPAs to whole-sites to enable repair and renewal of marine systems; • Reflects an ambition for sustainable livelihoods by fully integrating fisheries management with conservation (Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management) as the two are critically interdependent; • Establishes a world class and cost effective ecological and socio-economic monitoring and evaluation framework that includes the use of controls and sentinel sites to improve sustainability in marine management; and • Challenges policy makers and practitioners to be progressive by integrating MPAs into the wider seascape as critical functional components rather than a competing interest and move beyond MPAs as the only tool to underpin the benefits derived from marine ecosystems by identifying other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) to establish synergies with wider governance frameworks.","Marine","University of York"
"Options for managing human threats to high seas biodiversity.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/156565/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Hoppit, George; Townley, Adam","January 2020","Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) constitute 61% of the world’s oceans and are collectively managed by countries under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Growing concern regarding the deteriorating state of the oceans and ineffective management of ABNJ has resulted in negotiations to develop an international legally binding instrument (ILBI) for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction under UNCLOS. To inform these negotiations, we identified existing and emerging human activities and influences that affect ABNJ and evaluated management options available to mitigate the most pervasive, with highest potential for impact and probability of emergence. The highest-ranking activities and influences that affect ABNJ were fishing/hunting, maritime shipping, climate change and its associated effects, land-based pollution and mineral exploitation. Management options are diverse and available through a variety of actors, although their actions are not always effective. Area-based management tools (ABMTs), including marine protected areas (MPAs), were the only consistently effective option to mitigate impacts across high-ranked activities and influences. However, addressing land-based pollution will require national action to prevent this at its source, and MPAs offer only a partial solution for climate change. A new ABNJ ILBI could help unify management options and actors to conserve marine biodiversity and ensure sustainable use. Incorporating a mechanism to establish effective ABMTs into the ILBI will help deliver multiple objectives based on the ecosystem approach.","Marine","University of York"
"Effects of Sea Salt Aerosol Emissions for Marine Cloud Brightening on Atmospheric Chemistry : Implications for Radiative Forcing.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/156250/","Horowitz, Hannah M.; Holmes, Christopher; Wright, Alicia","January 2020","Marine cloud brightening (MCB) is proposed to offset global warming by emitting sea salt aerosols to the tropical marine boundary layer, which increases aerosol and cloud albedo. Sea salt aerosol is the main source of tropospheric reactive chlorine (Cly) and bromine (Bry). The effects of additional sea salt on atmospheric chemistry have not been explored. We simulate sea salt aerosol injections for MCB under two scenarios (212–569 Tg/a) in the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model, only considering their impacts as a halogen source. Globally, tropospheric Cly and Bry increase (20–40%), leading to decreased ozone (−3 to −6%). Consequently, OH decreases (−3 to −5%), which increases the methane lifetime (3–6%). Our results suggest that the chemistry of the additional sea salt leads to minor total radiative forcing compared to that of the sea salt aerosol itself (~2%) but may have potential implications for surface ozone pollution in tropical coastal regions.","Marine","University of York"
"Marine Conservation Begins at Home : How a Local Community and Protection of a Small Bay Sent Waves of Change Around the UK and Beyond.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/158673/","Stewart, Bryce Donald; Howarth, Leigh Michael; Wood, Howard L.","January 2020","The Firth of Clyde, on the west coast of Scotland, was once one of the most productive fishing grounds in Europe. However, successive decades of poor management and overfishing led to a dramatic loss of biodiversity and the collapse of finfish fisheries. In response, concerned local residents on the Isle of Arran, which lies in the middle of the Clyde, formed the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST) in 1995. After 13 years of campaigning, a small (2.67 km2) area in Lamlash Bay became Scotland’s first no-take zone (NTZ) in 2008, and only the second in the UK. Since protection, biodiversity has increased substantially, along with the size, age and density of commercially important species such as the king scallop, Pecten maximus, and the European lobster, Homarus gammarus. Arguably more important, however, is the influence the Lamlash Bay NTZ and COAST have had on UK marine protection in general. Most notably, detailed research has created a case study that clearly demonstrates the benefits of protection in an area where little such evidence is available. This case has been used repeatedly to support efforts for increased protection of UK waters to help rebuild marine ecosystems and enhance their resilience in an uncertain future. In Scotland specifically, lobbying by COAST led to the designation of a much larger marine protected area (MPA, >250 km2) around the south of Arran, one of 30 new MPAs in the country. Evidence from Lamlash Bay has supported development of strong protection for these MPAs, seeing off lobbyist efforts to weaken management. Arran’s conservation success has been recognized internationally and is inspiring greater involvement of local communities around the UK, and further afield, to take the destiny of their coastal waters into their own hands. Successful marine conservation begins at home.","Marine","University of York"
"What is the nature and extent of evidence on methodologies for monitoring and evaluating marine spatial management measures in UK and similar coastal waters? A systematic map protocol.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/154166/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Stewart, Bryce Donald; McKinley, Emma","October 2019","Background Anthropogenic degradation of marine ecosystems is widely accepted as a major social-ecological problem. The growing urgency to better manage marine ecosystems has led to the increasing application of ‘spatial management measures’ including marine protected areas, sectoral (e.g. fishery) closures, and marine spatial planning. However, the designation of varied spatial management regimes is just the first step; achievement of objectives relies upon effective implementation, monitoring, evaluation and adaptation. Despite spatial management being a core component of the marine management portfolio, to our knowledge, there is no systematic overview of the evidence on methodologies available, and employed, to monitor and evaluate their effectiveness across social, economic and ecological outcomes. Methods This systematic map will examine existing evidence describing methodologies for monitoring the effects, and evaluating the effectiveness, of marine spatial management across ecological, social and economic outcomes. Our aim is to provide a resource for decision-makers, primarily in the UK but also internationally, that supports effective marine management, and to describe the current evidence base. Identification and evaluation of relevant studies will therefore be restricted to coastal countries identified by our Stakeholder Group as being relevant to the UK, and searches will be restricted to the period 2009 to 2019 to align with the current UK policy context. Searches for relevant grey and academic literature, published in English, will be conducted in four bibliographic search engines, Google Scholar, 38 organisational websites and one specialist data repository. Eligibility screening will be conducted first at title and abstract level, and then at full text. Coding and meta-data extraction from eligible studies will include: bibliographic information, general information about the spatial management measure studied, and methodological information on the monitoring and evaluation undertaken. Consistency checking amongst reviewers will be undertaken during screening, coding and data extraction phases. The outcome of the systematic map will be a database that displays the meta-data of identified relevant studies. Findings will be presented in a descriptive report detailing the evaluation approaches and analytical methodologies employed, and data collection methods applied and/or data required by relevant studies to inform evaluations on the effectiveness of marine spatial management measures.","Marine","University of York"
"A fulfilled human life : Eliciting sense of place and cultural identity in two UK marine environments through the Community Voice Method.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/150123/","Ainsworth, Gillian B.; Kenter, Jasper O.; O'Connor, Sebastian","August 2019","Human impacts on the marine environment threaten the wellbeing of hundreds of millions of people. Marine environments are a common-pool resource (CPR) and one of their major management challenges is how to incorporate the value of ecosystem services to society in decision-making. Cultural ecosystem services (CES) relate to the often intangible benefits people receive from their interactions with the natural environment and contribute to individual and collective human wellbeing. Priority knowledge gaps include the need to better understand shared values regarding CES, and how to effectively integrate these values into decision-making. We filmed 40 Community Voice Method interviews with marine stakeholders in two areas of the UK to improve on the valuation of coastal and marine CES. Results show that cultural benefits including sense of place, aesthetic pleasure and cultural identity were bi-directional, contributed directly to a ‘fulfilled human life’ and were associated with charismatic marine life and biodiversity. Other-regarding self-transcendence values were salient underscoring a desire for sustainable marine management. We critically reflect on our analytical framework that integrates aspects of the UK National Ecosystem Assessment and IPBES conceptual frameworks. The thematic codebook developed for this study could prove useful for future comparative studies in other marine CES contexts. We propose that values-led management could increase the efficacy of marine planning strategies.","Marine","University of York"
"Understanding Iodine Chemistry Over the Northern and Equatorial Indian Ocean.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/150493/","Mahajan, Anoop S.; Tinel, Liselotte; Sarkar, Amit","February 2019","Observations of halogen oxides, ozone, meteorological parameters, and physical and biogeochemical water column measurements were made in the Indian Ocean and its marine boundary layer as a part of the Second International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2). The expedition took place on board the oceanographic research vessel Sagar Nidhi during 4–22 December 2015 from Goa, India, to Port Louis, Mauritius. Observations of mixed layer depth, averaged temperature, salinity, and nitrate concentrations were used to calculate predicted iodide concentrations in the seawater. The inorganic iodine ocean-atmosphere flux (hypoiodous acid [HOI] and molecular iodine [I2]) was computed using the predicted iodide concentrations, measured atmospheric ozone, and wind speed. Iodine oxide (IO) mixing ratios peaked at 0.47 ± 0.29 pptv (parts per trillion by volume) in the remote open ocean environment. The estimated iodide concentrations and HOI and I2 fluxes peaked at 200/500 nM, 410/680 nmol·m−2·day−1, and 20/80 nmol·m−2·day−1, respectively, depending on the parameterization used. The calculated fluxes for HOI and I2 were higher closer to the Indian subcontinent; however, atmospheric IO was only observed above the detection limit in the remote open ocean environment. We use NO2 observations to show that titration of IO by NO2 is the main reason for this result. These observations show that inorganic iodine fluxes and atmospheric IO show similar trends in the Indian Ocean marine boundary layer, but the impact of inorganic iodine emissions on iodine chemistry is buffered in elevated NOx environments, even though the estimated oceanic iodine fluxes are higher.","Marine","University of York"
"Elemental Problems, Methodical Solutions : Expertise, Ecology and Entertainment in the Study of Marine Mammals.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/147390/","Rees, Amanda","June 2019","This paper examines the development of socio-technical strategies and practices that have been developed, by both experts and laypeople, to study and to display the socio-ecology of marine mammals. The late 1950s saw the emergence of a distinctively different approach to the understanding of animal behaviour and biology – one that focused on the observation and (sometimes) manipulation of animals as they lived under natural conditions. In the first instance, it was applied to land animals, birds and insects in Europe, America and the territories that either were, or had been, under colonial control. By the early 21st century, however, many wild-living colonies of whales, dolphins and seals were being studied by researchers, and many of them – as with terrestrial animals – were not just known individually, but could be placed on a generations-deep family tree. This paper will explore how this transition was managed. It will show how it was possible for scientists to study live animal behaviour in an element inimical to human survival, and how researchers borrowed key methodological practices from other human activities in order to access their research subjects. It will show how these socio-technical developments intersected with the efforts to display marine mammals on land and above all, it will demonstrate the ways in which the agency of the animals under observation had an essential role to play in the emergence of cetology as a profession and as a form of knowledge.","Marine","University of York"

This review identifies the minor, intermediate and major impediments (respectively defined as ‘bottlenecks, showstoppers and train-wrecks’) to marine management, resulting from a 4-year analysis of national, regional and European reports. Most of the problems are linked to the resistance of countries to collaborate and to the inability to integrate the work already carried out under other pieces of legislation. The European countries will need to better integrate and coordinate their actions in marine management in the second cycle of the MSFD, in order to achieve its final goal of Good Environmental Status as well as the objectives of other environmental policies.","Marine","University of York"

In this study, a single-step microwave process was used to depolymerise a range of macroalgae native to the United Kingdom, producing a growth medium suitable for microbial fermentation. The medium contained a range of mono- and polysaccharides as well as macro- and micronutrients that could be metabolised by the oleaginous yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima. Among twelve macroalgae species, the brown seaweeds exhibited the highest fermentation potential, especially the kelp Saccharina latissima. Applying a portfolio of ten native M. pulcherrima strains, yeast growth kinetics, as well as production of lipids and 2-phenylethanol were examined, with productivity and growth rate being strain dependent. On the 2 L scale, 6.9 g L−1 yeast biomass – a yield of 0.14 g g−1 with respect to the supplied macroalgae – containing 37.2% (w/w) lipid was achieved through utilisation of the proteins, mono- and polysaccharides from S. latissima, with no additional enzymes. In addition, the yeast degraded a range of fermentation inhibitors released upon microwave processing at high temperatures and long holding times. As macroalgae can be cultured to food grade, this system offers a novel, potentially low-cost route to edible microbial oils as well as a renewable feedstock for oleochemicals.","Marine","University of York"
"The interplay between economics, legislative power and social influence examined through a social-ecological framework for marine ecosystems services.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/137199/","Martino, Simone; Tett, Paul; Kenter, Jasper","September 2018","In the last 15 years, conservation has shifted increasingly towards perspectives based on the instrumental value of nature, where what counts is what provides benefits to humans. The ecosystem services framework embraces this vision of nature through monetary valuation of the environment to correct market failures and government distortions that hinder efficient allocation of public goods, including goods and services provided by biodiversity and ecosystems. The popularity of this approach is reflected in different countries legislation; for instance, US, EU and UK have introduced economic criteria for comparing costs and benefits of environmental policies in protecting ecosystem services. From an operational perspective, the ecosystem services framework requires ecologists to estimate how the supply of services is affected by changes in the functionality and/or the extent of ecosystems; and economists to identify how changes in the supply affect the flow of direct and indirect benefits to people. However, this approach may be simplistic when faced with the complexity of social-ecological systems. We investigated this for three different marine services: assimilative capacity of waste, coastal defense and renewable energy. We find that economic valuation could provide efficient and fair allocations in the case of assimilative capacity, but leads to social clashes between outputs generated by cost benefit analysis and citizens’ expectation in the case of coastal defense. In the case of renewable energy, controversies can be generated by regulatory mechanisms that are not necessarily aligned with the interests of industry or important social groups. We conclude that there is a need to integrate perspectives arising from utilitarian allocation of resources with those involving legislation and communal values in order to reconcile conflicting interests and better sustain marine social-ecological systems.","Marine","University of York"
"Evidence gaps and biodiversity threats facing the marine environment of the United Kingdom’s Overseas Territories.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/139484/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Fieldhouse, Philip; McClean, Colin John","November 2018","Understanding the evidence base and identifying threats to the marine environment is critical to ensure cost-effective management and to identify priorities for future research. The United Kingdom (UK) government is responsible for approximately 2% of the world’s oceans, most of which belongs to its 14 Overseas Territories (UKOTs). Containing biodiversity of global significance, and far in excess of the UK mainland’s domestic species, there has recently been a strong desire from many of the UKOTs, the UK Government, and NGOs to improve marine management in these places. Implementing evidence-based marine policy is, however, challenged by the disparate nature of scientific research in the UKOTs and knowledge gaps about the threats they face. Here, we address these issues by systematically searching for scientific literature which has examined UKOT marine biodiversity and by exploring publicly available spatial threat data. We find that UKOT marine biodiversity has received consistent, but largely low, levels of scientific interest, and there is considerable geographical and subject bias in research effort. Of particular concern is the lack of research focus on management or threats to biodiversity. The extent and intensity of threats vary amongst and within the UKOTs but unsurprisingly, climate change associated threats affect them all and direct human stressors are more prevalent in those with higher human populations. To meet global goals for effective conservation and management, there is an urgent need for additional and continued investment in research and management in the Overseas Territories, particularly those that have been of lesser focus.","Marine","University of York"

IO was observed almost ubiquitously in the open ocean with larger mixing ratios south of the Polar Front (PF). Contrary to previous reports, IO was not positively correlated to sea surface temperature (SST)/salinity, or negatively to chlorophyll a. Over the whole expedition, SST showed a weak negative correlation with respect to IO while chl a was positively correlated. North of the PF, chl a showed a strong positive correlation with IO. The computed HOI and I2 fluxes do not show any significant correlation with atmospheric IO. Simulations with the global CAM-Chem model show a reasonably good agreement with observations north of the PF but the model fails to reproduce the elevated IO south of the PF indicating that the current emission parametrizations are not sufficient to explain iodine chemistry in the Southern Indian Ocean.","Marine","University of York"
"Structure and function of a glycoside hydrolase family 8 endoxylanase from Teredinibacter turnerae.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/137106/","Fowler, Claire A; Hemsworth, Glyn R; Cuskin, Fiona","July 2018","The biological conversion of lignocellulosic matter into high-value chemicals or biofuels is of increasing industrial importance as the sector slowly transitions away from nonrenewable sources. Many industrial processes involve the use of cellulolytic enzyme cocktails - a selection of glycoside hydrolases and, increasingly, polysaccharide oxygenases - to break down recalcitrant plant polysaccharides. ORFs from the genome of Teredinibacter turnerae, a symbiont hosted within the gills of marine shipworms, were identified in order to search for enzymes with desirable traits. Here, a putative T. turnerae glycoside hydrolase from family 8, hereafter referred to as TtGH8, is analysed. The enzyme is shown to be active against β-1,4-xylan and mixed-linkage (β-1,3,β-1,4) marine xylan. Kinetic parameters, obtained using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection and 3,5-dinitrosalicyclic acid reducing-sugar assays, show that TtGH8 catalyses the hydrolysis of β-1,4-xylohexaose with a k cat/K m of 7.5 × 10 7  M -1  min -1 but displays maximal activity against mixed-linkage polymeric xylans, hinting at a primary role in the degradation of marine polysaccharides. The three-dimensional structure of TtGH8 was solved in uncomplexed and xylobiose-, xylotriose- and xylohexaose-bound forms at approximately 1.5 Å resolution; the latter was consistent with the greater k cat/K m for hexasaccharide substrates. A 2,5B boat conformation observed in the -1 position of bound xylotriose is consistent with the proposed conformational itinerary for this class of enzyme. This work shows TtGH8 to be effective at the degradation of xylan-based substrates, notably marine xylan, further exemplifying the potential of T. turnerae for effective and diverse biomass degradation.","Marine","University of York"
"Ecological connectivity across ocean depths : implications for protected area design.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/134977/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Roberts, Callum Michael","August 2018","Coastal nations have embarked on a rapid program of marine protected area (MPA) establishment, incentivised by the approaching 2020 deadline of United Nations global marine protection targets. Alongside, efforts are underway to extend protection into areas beyond national jurisdiction through a new international legally binding instrument. These developments are welcome but there are risks that in meeting them, nations will still fail to supply adequate protection to marine life. An increasing number of MPAs protect the seabed while the water column remains open to fishing. This is because vulnerable habitats in need of protection are disproportionately perceived to be those on the seabed, while the water column is viewed as much less at risk. The seabed and water column are, however, inextricably linked. Transitions between human-defined vertical ocean zones are blurred, with animals and oceanographic features moving across depths. Here, we explore a rapidly growing literature on ecological and environmental connections through the water column, and between the water column and the seabed, to consider whether vertically stratified management is justified from an ecological standpoint. We find that emerging research increasingly links upper-ocean communities and processes to seabed ecology and biogeochemistry suggesting that exploitation of the water column is likely to have a significant and widely distributed footprint in the deep-sea. We conclude that there is a strong a priori case for surface to seabed protection within MPAs, and that this should be the default, precautionary approach to safeguard intact ecosystems with as near to natural function as possible.","Marine","University of York"
"Can national management measures achieve good status across international boundaries? : a case study of the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast sub-region.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/129429/","Cavallo, Marianna; Elliott, Mike; Quintino, Victor","April 2018","Coastal countries have historically implemented management measures to improve the status of their national marine waters and little effort has been made to take coordinated actions to improve the status of the entire region or sub- region of which they are part. At the European level, the adoption of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to remedy this deficiency and to promote coordination among countries and an integrated management of the marine environment. The MSFD requires each country to propose and adopt a programme of measures to achieve Good Environmental Status of the regional seas. This study compares the programmes of measures of the three countries of the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast sub-region – France, Portugal and Spain – presenting a novel use of multivariate analyses using semi-quantitative policy information. Among the four North-East Atlantic sub-regions, this study area was chosen because it showed the lowest levels of coherence during the first phase of the implementation of the MSFD, according to the European Commission assessment. The results show the differences among the three programmes, confirming the difficulties that neighbouring countries face when they are required to adopt common approaches in the implementation of this multi-sectoral Directive. Most of the measures developed in the sub-region address marine biodiversity but this is through a wide range of actions, covering different pressures and different species/habitats. The integration with other legislation is more similar between Spain and France and differs between these and Portugal. The three countries also recognise the lack of knowledge to perform the economic analysis, in particular in quantifying the costs of and social benefits derived from their measures. It is concluded here that a better use of the regional and European coordination structures is needed to fill the gaps in knowledge and to exchange good practices. More political will is necessary to take action at European and international level to mitigate the impact of those socio-economic activities through joint programmes, for which Community funding is available.","Marine","University of York"
"Does bathymetry drive coastal Whale Shark (Rhincodon typus) aggregations?","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/131887/","Copping, Joshua; Stewart, Bryce Donald; McClean, Colin John","May 2018","Background The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is known to aggregate in a number of coastal locations globally, however what causes these aggregations to form where they do is largely unknown. This study examines whether bathymetry is an important driver of coastal aggregation locations for R. typus through bathymetry’s effect on primary productivity and prey availability. This is a global study taking into account all coastal areas within R. typus’ range. Methods R. typus aggregation locations were identified through an extensive literature review. Global bathymetric data were compared at R. typus aggregation locations and a large random selection of non-aggregation areas. Generalised linear models were used to assess which bathymetric characteristic had the biggest influence on aggregation presence. Results Aggregation sites were significantly shallower than non-aggregation sites and in closer proximity to deep water (the mesopelagic zone) by two orders of magnitude. Slope at aggregation sites was significantly steeper than non-aggregation sites. These three bathymetric variables were shown to have the biggest association with aggregation sites, with up to 88% of deviation explained by the GLMs. Discussion The three key bathymetric characteristics similar at the aggregation sites are known to induce upwelling events, increase primary productivity and consequently attract numerous other filter feeding species. The location of aggregation sites in these key areas can be attributed to this increased prey availability, thought to be the main reason R. typus aggregations occur, extensively outlined in the literature. The proximity of aggregations to shallow areas such as reefs could also be an important factor why whale sharks thermoregulate after deep dives to feed. These findings increase our understanding of whale shark behaviour and may help guide the identification and conservation of further aggregation sites.","Marine","University of York"
"Benefits and impediments for the integrated and coordinated management of European seas.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/125129/","Cavallo, Marianna; Elliott, Michael; Touza-Montero, Julia Maria","September 2017","New multi-sectoral policies with a regional implementation are developed when maritime states recognise the importance of managing the marine environment under an ecosystem-perspective rather than a use-perspective. In Europe, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is the first attempt to promote an integrated management of the seas from the coastline to the limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone. This paper shows that, nine years from the MSFD adoption, there remain several ecological, economic, social and governance challenges. Using information gathered in a dedicated survey of the European Union Marine Strategy Coordination Group and in the recent literature the paper identifies the obstacles preventing a successful regional cooperation and policy integration. The survey indicates that the MSFD coordination structures are, in general, well-developed but there is an apparent lack of political will to coordinate actions at the regional level. Member States request greater flexibility to implement the Directive but they put their national interests before the benefit of a coherent and integrated approach for the entire region. Differences in budget, economic sector predominance, lack of staff and the MSFD short time-scale are identified as the factors that can hamper cooperation. These have produced recommendations of possible strategies for optimising regional coordination structures which respect the subsidiarity principle underpinning the MSFD.","Marine","University of York"
"The trade-off between tidal-turbine array yield and impact on flow: A multi-objective optimisation problem.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/119470/","du Feu, R.J.; Funke, S.W.; Kramer, S.C.","July 2017","Abstract This paper introduces a new approach for investigating trade-offs between different societal objectives in the design of tidal-turbine arrays. This method is demonstrated through the trade-off between the yield of an array, and the extent to which that array alters the flow. This is posed as a multi-objective optimisation problem, and the problem is investigated using the array layout optimisation tool OpenTidalFarm. Motivated by environmental concerns, OpenTidalFarm is adapted to not only maximise array yield but also to minimise the effect of the array upon the hydrodynamics of the region, specifically the flow velocity. A linear scalarisation of the multi-objective optimisation problem is solved for a series of different weightings of the two conflicting objectives. Two idealised test scenarios are evaluated and in each case a set of Pareto solutions is found. These arrays are assessed for the power they generate and the severity of change they cause in the flow velocity. These analyses allow for the identification of trade-offs between these two objectives, while the methods proposed can similarly be applied to the two key societal objectives of energy production and conservation, thus providing information that could be valuable to stakeholders and policymakers when making decisions on array design.","Marine","University of York"
"Particulate phases are key in controlling dissolved iron concentrations in the (sub)tropical North Atlantic.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/127894/","Milne, Angela; Schlosser, Christian; Wake, Bronwyn D.","February 2017","The supply and bioavailability of iron (Fe) controls primary productivity and N2 fixation in large parts of the global ocean. An important, yet poorly quantified, source to the ocean is particulate Fe (pFe). Here we present the first combined dataset of particulate, labile-particulate (L-pFe), and dissolved Fe (dFe) from the (sub)tropical North Atlantic. We show a strong relationship between L-pFe and dFe, indicating a dynamic equilibrium between these two phases whereby particles “buffer” dFe and maintain the elevated concentrations observed. Moreover, L-pFe can increase the overall “available” (L-pFe + dFe) Fe pool by up to 55%. The lateral shelf flux of this available Fe was similar in magnitude to observed soluble aerosol-Fe deposition, a comparison that has not been previously considered. These findings demonstrate that L-pFe is integral to Fe cycling and hence plays a role in regulating carbon cycling, warranting its inclusion in Fe budgets and biogeochemical models.","Marine","University of York"
"Trade-offs in marine protection : Multi-species interactions within a community-led temperate marine reserve.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/105519/","Howarth, Leigh Michael; Dubois, Pascal; Gratton, Paul","August 2016","This study investigated the effects of a community-led temperate marine reserve in Lamlash Bay, Firth of Clyde, Scotland, on commercially important populations of European lobster (Homarus gammarus), brown crab (Cancer pagurus), and velvet swimming crabs (Necora puber). Potting surveys conducted over 4 years revealed significantly higher catch per unit effort (cpue 109% greater), weight per unit effort (wpue 189% greater), and carapace length (10-15 mm greater) in lobsters within the reserve compared with control sites. However, likely due to low levels of recruitment and increased fishing effort outside the reserve, lobster catches decreased in all areas during the final 2 years. Nevertheless, catch rates remained higher within the reserve across all years, suggesting the reserve buffered these wider declines. Additionally, lobster cpue and wpue declined with increasing distance from the boundaries of the marine reserve, a trend which tag-recapture data suggested were due to spillover. Catches of berried lobster were also twice as high within the reserve than outside, and the mean potential reproductive output per female was 22.1% greater. It was originally thought that higher densities of lobster within the reserve might lead to greater levels of aggression and physical damage. However, damage levels were solely related to body size, as large lobsters >110 mm had sustained over 218% more damage than smaller individuals. Interestingly, catches of adult lobsters were inversely correlated with those of juvenile lobsters, brown crabs, and velvet crabs, which may be evidence of competitive displacement and/or predation. Our findings provide evidence that temperate marine reserves can deliver fisheries and conservation benefits, and highlight the importance of investigating multispecies interactions, as the recovery of some species can have knock-on effects on others.","Marine","University of York"
"Subjective well-being indicators for large-scale assessment of cultural ecosystem services.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/132657/","Bryce, Rosalind; Irvine, Katherine N.; Church, Andrew","July 2016","The substantial importance of cultural benefits as a source of human well-being is increasingly recognised in society-environment interactions. The integration of cultural ecosystem services (CES) into the ecosystem services framework remains a challenge due to the difficulties associated with defining, articulating and measuring CES. We operationalise a novel framework developed by the UK National Ecosystem Assessment that identifies CES as the interactions between environmental spaces (i.e. physical localities or landscapes), and the activities that occur there. We evaluate the benefits of the CES provided by 151 UK marine sites to recreational sea anglers and divers, using subjective well-being indicators. Factor analysis of an online questionnaire with 1220 participants revealed multiple CES benefits that contribute to human wellbeing e.g. including ‘engagement with nature’, ‘place identity’ and ‘therapeutic value’. In addition to regional differences, we also found that biophysical attributes of sites, such as the presence of charismatic species and species diversity, were positively associated with provision of CES benefits. The study provides evidence that could be used to inform designation of protected areas. The indicators used in the study may also be adapted for use across a range of marine and terrestrial spaces for improved integration of CES in environmental decision-making.","Marine","University of York"

In this paper we present the results of pollen analysis performed on cave hyena coprolites [Crocuta crocuta spelaea (Goldfuss, 1832)] from Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) sites of Cava Muracci (Cisterna di Latina, central Italy) and Tana delle Iene (Ceglie Messapica, southern Italy). This study provides new insights into the vegetation of the Late Pleistocene of peninsular Italy, until now known only through long pollen records. It also shows how the content of coprolites, combined with faunal data and geochronological investigations, can represent a potential integrative source of palaeoclimatic proxy data. Our results indicate that the surroundings of both of the hyena dens were characterised by a patchy landscape with open lowlands dominated by steppe and grassland vegetation, while a few mesophilous and thermophilous trees were present in more humid areas, probably along the marine coast and inland. The harsh glacial climate appears to have been milder at Cava Muracci than at Tana delle Iene. This could be due either to the different environmental features of the two sites or to the high climatic variability that occurred during MIS3.","Marine","University of York"

The conversion of dimethyl sulfide to sulfuric acid is the dominant source of oceanic secondary aerosol. Ocean emitted iodine can also produce aerosol. Using a GEOS-Chem model, we present a simulation of iodine aerosol. The simulation compares well with the limited observational data set. Iodine aerosol concentrations are highest in the tropical marine boundary layer (MBL) averaging 5.2 ng (I) m −3 with monthly maximum concentrations of 90 ng (I) m −3. These masses are small compared to sulfate (0.75% of MBL burden, up to 11% regionally) but are more significant compared to dimethyl sulfide sourced sulfate (3% of the MBL burden, up to 101% regionally). In the preindustrial, iodine aerosol makes up 0.88% of the MBL burden sulfate mass and regionally up to 21%. Iodine aerosol may be an important regional mechanism for ocean-atmosphere interaction.","Marine","University of York"

For the first time, ΔR values were reliably determined for these coastal waters, and also for the first time a ΔR was calculated for the Late Pleistocene in Atlantic Iberia. Pairs of coeval samples of different carbon reservoirs selected from Upper Paleolithic (Late Pleistocene) and Mesolithic (Early Holocene) contexts yielded ΔR weighted mean values of −117±70 14C yr and −105±21 14C yr, respectively. These values show oceanographic conditions characterized by a reduced offset between atmospheric and surface water 14C contents, suggesting a nonexistent or a very weak upwelling and some stratification of the water column. Similar oceanographic conditions have been recorded in other areas of Atlantic Iberia during the Holocene, such as off Andalusian and northwestern Galician coasts. Results not only provide useful information on environmental conditions but also a framework to obtain more precise and reliable absolute chronologies for the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene in northern Iberia.","Marine","University of York"
"The ability of regional coordination and policy integration to produce coherent marine management : Implementing the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in the North-East Atlantic.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/97942/","Cavallo, Marianna; Elliott, Michael; Touza, Julia M.","February 2016","The transboundary nature of the marine environment requires concerted actions among neighbouring countries to improve its quality in an effective way. Coordination at international level is particularly important during the implementation of environmental policies aimed at reducing the widespread pressures derived from activities, such as shipping and fishing. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to protect and improve the status of a wide range of ecosystem components with a regional focus, promoting cooperation among countries and integration with other environmental policies. In 2014, the European Commission assessed the level of adequacy, consistency and coherence achieved by Member States during the implementation of the first phase of the MSFD and hence this paper focuses on the cross-border coherence and coordination within one marine region in order to achieve the goals of the Directive. In particular, it identifies and analyses the main differences among the results of the implementation of the first phase of the MSFD across the North-East Atlantic region. This analysis shows that, in general, the use of existing data, methodologies and targets from related environmental policies corresponds to the higher levels of coherence among countries while a limited use of such policies produces less coherence. This suggests that the European Commission, Regional Seas Conventions and Member States should work together to identify the real connection between the MSFD and other policies to make a proper use of existing data and approaches and to harmonise different policy objectives. In particular, the review shows what might be termed a 'paradox of coherence' amongst Member States where coherence of action has to be achieved within a European policy of subsidiarity, the act of Member States having control over the way they implement framework directives. This can be regarded as a fundamental flaw in having a 'Framework Directive' instead of the greater control in a 'Directive'","Marine","University of York"
"Sessile and mobile components of a benthic ecosystem display mixed trends within a temperate marine reserve.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/84754/","Howarth, Leigh Michael; Pickup, Sarah; Evans, Lowri","March 2015","Despite recent efforts to increase the global coverage of marine protected areas (MPAs), studies investigating the effectiveness of marine protected areas within temperate waters remain scarce. Furthermore, out of the few studies published on MPAs in temperate waters, the majority focus on specific ecological or fishery components rather than investigating the ecosystem as a whole. This study therefore investigated both the dynamics of benthic communities as well as fish populations within a recently established, fully protected marine reserve in Lamlash Bay, Isle of Arran, United Kingdom, over a four year period. A combination of photo and diver surveys revealed live maerl (Phymatolithon calcareum), macroalgae, sponges, hydroids, feather stars and eyelash worms (Myxicola infundibulum) to be significantly more abundant within the marine reserve than on surrounding fishing grounds. Likewise, the overall composition of epifaunal communities in and outside the reserve was significantly different. Both results are consistent with the hypothesis that protecting areas from fishing can encourage seafloor habitats to recover. In addition, the greater abundance of complex habitats within the reserve appeared to providing nursery habitat for juvenile cod (Gadus morhua) and scallops (Pecten maximus and Aequipecten opercularis). In contrast, there was little difference in the abundance of mobile benthic fauna, such as crabs and starfish, between the reserve and outside. Similarly, the use of baited underwater video cameras revealed no difference in the abundance and size of fish between the reserve and outside. Limited recovery of these ecosystem components may be due to the relatively small size (2.67 km2) and young age of the reserve (< 5 years), both of which might have limited the extent of any benefits afforded to mobile fauna and fish communities. Overall, this study provides evidence that fully protected marine reserves can encourage seafloor habitats to recover, which in turn, can create a number of benefits that flow back to other species, including those of commercial importance.","Marine","University of York"
"Effects of ecosystem protection on scallop populations within a community-led temperate marine reserve.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/105475/","Howarth, Leigh Michael; Roberts, Callum Michael; Hawkins, Julie Patricia","February 2015","This study investigated the effects of a newly established, fully protected marine reserve on benthic habitats and two commercially valuable species of scallop in Lamlash Bay, Isle of Arran, United Kingdom. Annual dive surveys from 2010 to 2013 showed the abundance of juvenile scallops to be significantly greater within the marine reserve than outside. Generalised linear models revealed this trend to be significantly related to the greater presence of macroalgae and hydroids growing within the boundaries of the reserve. These results suggest that structurally complex habitats growing within the reserve have substantially increased spat settlement and/or survival. The density of adult king scallops declined threefold with increasing distance from the boundaries of the reserve, indicating possible evidence of spillover or reduced fishing effort directly outside and around the marine reserve. However, there was no difference in the mean density of adult scallops between the reserve and outside. Finally, the mean age, size, and reproductive and exploitable biomass of king scallops were all significantly greater within the reserve. In contrast to king scallops, the population dynamics of queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis) fluctuated randomly over the survey period and showed little difference between the reserve and outside. Overall, this study is consistent with the hypothesis that marine reserves can encourage the recovery of seafloor habitats, which, in turn, can benefit populations of commercially exploited species, emphasising the importance of marine reserves in the ecosystem-based management of fisheries.","Marine","University of York"

In particular it identifies a marked increase in imported cod from the thirteenth century AD. That trend continued into the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, after a short downturn, perhaps attributable to the impact of the Black Death, in the mid fourteenth century. The detailed pattern of fluctuating abundance illustrates the potential of archaeological information that is now available from the high-quality urban excavations conducted in London and similar centres during recent decades.","Marine","University of York"

The UK is also home to the largest queen scallop fishery out of all of Europe. However, concerns have been raised about the effects of this recent growth of UK scallop fisheries among scientists and conservation bodies, as well as amongst the public following recent media campaigns (e.g. Hugh’s Fish Fight). This is because the majority of scallop landings (95%) are made by vessels towing scallop dredges, a type of fishing gear known to cause substantial environmental impacts. In addition, several scallop stocks are showing signs of overexploitation and there is concern over future impacts of ocean warming and acidification. Although, there have been several recent improvements in the management of scallop fisheries in parts of the UK, information on many scallop stocks around the UK is still lacking. This report therefore proposes that better monitoring and stock assessments are needed for these scallop fisheries and stocks. With recent legislation soon to result in the development of a new network of marine protected areas (MPAs) around the UK, and improved management of fisheries in European Marine Sites, now is a crucial time to review the UK scallop dredge fishery and its impacts on the wider environment so that this new legislation can support a sustainable future for the UK scallop fishery. This report was therefore commissioned by the Sustainable Inshore Fisheries Trust with the aim of collating existing knowledge on the management and environmental impacts of scallop fisheries around the UK.","Marine","University of York"

The discussion assesses the impact of factors such as topography and the distribution of resources on land and on the seacoast, taking account of geographical variation and changes in geology, sea levels and palaeoclimate. The merits of northern and southern routes of movement at either end of the Red Sea are compared. All the evidence indicates that there has been no land connection at the southern end since the beginning of the Pliocene period, but that short sea crossings would have been possible at lowest sea-level stands with little or no technical aids. More important than the possibilities of crossing the southern channel is the nature of the resources available in the adjacent coastal zones. There were many climatic episodes wetter than today, and during these periods water draining from the Arabian escarpment provided productive conditions for large mammals and human populations in coastal regions and eastwards into the desert. During drier episodes the coastal region would have provided important refugia both in upland areas and on the emerged shelves exposed by lowered sea level, especially in the southern sector and on both sides of the Red Sea. Marine resources may have offered an added advantage in coastal areas, but evidence for their exploitation is very limited, and their role has been over-exaggerated in hypotheses of coastal colonization.","Marine","University of York"

"Factors associated with new-onset depressive symptoms in patients starting cardiac rehabilitation : Pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 period comparison.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199268/","Sever, Serdar; Harrison, Alexander; Doherty, Patrick","October 2022","OBJECTIVE: We aim to: 1) investigate whether starting cardiac rehabilitation (CR) during the COVID-19 period was influential on new-onset depressive symptoms, 2) examine the relationship between sociodemographic and medical factors with the new-onset of depressive symptoms before and during the COVID-19 period in UK patients commencing CR. METHODS: The national audit of cardiac rehabilitation (NACR) data were used and the two years of data before COVID-19 and during COVID-19 were analysed (Feb,2018 - Nov,2021). Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale measurement was used to assess depressive symptoms. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were conducted to examine the influence of the COVID-19 period on new-onset depressive symptoms and the patient characteristics associated with it. RESULTS: 71055 patients screened for new-onset depressive symptoms were included in the analysis. Based on multivariate analysis, patients commencing CR during COVID-19 were 8% more likely to have new onset depressive symptoms compared to patients commencing before COVID-19. Smoking (OR: 1.26, 95%CI: 1.11, 1.43), physical inactivity (OR: 1.86, 95%CI: 1.74, 1.98), high anxiety (OR: 1.45, 95%CI: 1.44, 1.46), being male (OR: 1.21, 95%CI: 1.12, 1.30), single (OR: 1.25, 95%CI: 1.16, 1.35), having comorbidities of arthritis, diabetes, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, claudication (OR range: 1.19 to 1.60), receiving CABG treatment (OR: 1.47, 95%CI: 1.25, 1.73), and having heart failure (OR: 1.33, 95%CI: 1.19, 1.48) were the factors associated with having new-onset depressive symptoms at the start of CR. CONCLUSION: Our findings have shown that starting CR during the COVID-19 period was associated with increased odds of having new-onset depressive symptoms.","Ai","University of York"
"Deep Residual Compensation Convolutional Network without Backpropagation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198786/","Alotaibi, Mubarakah; Wilson, Richard Charles","January 2023","PCANet and its variants provided good accuracy results for classification tasks. However, despite the importance of network depth in achieving good classification accuracy, these networks were trained with a maximum of nine layers. In this paper, we introduce a residual compensation convolutional network, which is the first PCANet-like network trained with hundreds of layers while improving classification accuracy. The design of the proposed network consists of several convolutional layers, each followed by post-processing steps and a classifier. To correct the classification errors and significantly increase the network’s depth, we train each layer with new labels derived from the residual information of all its preceding layers. This learning mechanism is accomplished by traversing the network’s layers in a single forward pass without backpropagation or gradient computations. Our experiments on four distinct classification benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet) show that our deep network outperforms all existing PCANet-like networks and is competitive with several traditional gradient-based models.","Ai","University of York"

"Effects of grazing and enclosure management on soil physical and chemical properties vary with aridity in China's drylands.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198706/","Zhou, Wenxin; Li, Changjia; Wang, Shuai","March 2023","Dryland soils are nutrient-poor and prone to degradation due to aridity, grazing and enclosure. It is essential to examine the effects of grazing and enclosure on aridity-induced soil degradation in dryland ecosystems to optimize land management practices in response to climate change. However, quantitative evaluation on this topic is scarce due to a lack of long-term field monitoring data. This study evaluated the combined effects of aridity and grazing/enclosure using long-term data (2005–2015) from three research stations on soil physical and chemical properties in typical steppes and desert steppes across the semi-arid and hyper-arid areas of China's drylands. Results showed that soil organic matter (OM) content was higher for enclosures (20.50 g/kg) than for grazing (19.06 g/kg). In the semi-arid steppe, enclosures aged 30–33 years had the highest soil total nitrogen (TN) content (1.21 g/kg). Longer enclosures aged 34–36 years showed decreased soil TN content (0.88 g/kg). In the desert steppe, enclosures aged 5–8 years exhibited the highest soil OM (2.44 g/kg) and TN (0.21 g/kg) contents. Grazing enhanced the decrease of OM content (from 4.57 to 2.39 g/kg) with increasing aridity (1 − aridity index) from 0.35 to 1. These findings indicate that enclosures can improve soil fertility, but prolonged enclosures may have negative effects. Grazing had a synergistic effect on the decrease of OM with aridity. Results can be used in response to climate changes to formulate sustainable land management strategies, such as reducing the enclosure period in wetter and restored areas, and diminishing the grazing intensity in areas with higher aridity.","Ai","University of York"
"The global impact of tobacco control policies on smokeless tobacco use : a systematic review.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199306/","Arora, Monika; Chugh, Aastha; Jain, Neha","April 2023","Background Smokeless tobacco (ST), used by more than 300 million people globally, results in substantial morbidity and mortality. For ST control, many countries have adopted policies beyond the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which has been instrumental in reducing smoking prevalence. The impact of these ST related policies (FCTC and non-FCTC) on ST remains unclear. Methods We systematically searched 11 electronic databases and grey literature from 2005 to September 2021 in English and key south Asian languages, to summarise ST policies and their impact. Two reviewers independently screened articles; data were extracted after standardisation . Quality of studies was appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool. Outcomes for impact assessment included ST prevalence, uptake, cessation, and health. Due to substantial heterogeneity in the descriptions of policies and outcomes, data were descriptively and narratively synthesised. Findings We identified 252 eligible studies describing ST policies. Fifty-seven countries had policies targeting ST of which 17 had non-FCTC policies for ST (e.g., spitting bans). Eighteen studies evaluated the impact. These were of variable quality (6 strong, 7 moderate and 5 weak) and reported mainly on prevalence of ST use. The body of work evaluating FCTC-based policy initiatives found that these were associated with reductions in ST prevalence: between -4.4% to -30.3% for taxation and -22.2% to -70.9% for multi-faceted policies. Two studies evaluating the non-FCTC policy of sales bans reported significant reductions in ST sale (-6.4%) and use (-17.6%); one however reported an increased trend in ST use in the youth after total sales ban, likely due to cross-border smuggling. The one study reporting on cessation found 13.3% increase in quit attempts in those exposed (47.5%) to FCTC policy: Education, communication, training, and public awareness, compared to non-exposed (34.2%). Interpretation Many countries have implemented ST control policies, including those that extend beyond FCTC. The available evidence suggests that taxation and multifaceted policy initiatives are associated with meaningful reductions in ST use.","Ai","University of York"

"Increasing spatial frequency of S-cone defined gratings reduces their visibility and brain response more than for gratings defined by L-M cone contrast.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197670/","Lowndes, Rebecca; Welbourne, Lauren; Williams, Molly","January 2023","Chromatic sensitivity reduces as spatial frequency increases. Here, we explore the behavioural and neuronal responses to chromatic stimuli at two spatial frequencies for which the difference in sensitivity will be greater for S-cone than L-M stimuli. Luminance artefacts were removed using the Random Luminance Modulation (RLM) technique. As expected, doubling the spatial frequency increased the detection threshold more for S-cone than for isoluminant L-M gratings. We then used fMRI to measure the cortical BOLD responses to the same two chromatic stimuli (S and L-M) at the same two spatial frequencies. Responses were measured in six visual areas (V1, V2, V3, V3a, hV4, TO1/2). We found a significant interaction between spatial frequency in V1, V2 and V4 suggesting that the behaviourally observed increase in contrast threshold for high spatial frequency S-cone stimuli is reflected in these retinotopic areas. Our measurements show that neural responses consistent with psychophysical behaviour in a colour detection task can be observed as early as primary visual cortex.","Ai","University of York"
"Identifying a destination's optimal tourist market mix : Does a superior portfolio model exist?","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/195206/","Mariani, Marcello; Platanakis, Emmanouil; Stafylas, Dimitrios","January 2023","Extant tourism research has used various portfolio model types to determine optimal tourist market mixes which simultaneously maximize total tourist expenditure and minimize the instability of international inbound tourism demand. We analyse the three portfolio models that have been applied in the tourism literature: two varieties of a levels model (that use the level of tourist arrivals, or bed nights to quantify tourist activity) and a growth rates model (that deploys the growth in the level of tourist activity). Applying these models using per capita expenditure in four distinctively different destination countries (Australia, Greece, Japan, and USA), we demonstrate that the Levels Model 1 is superior to the Levels Model 2 and the Growth Rates Model. It produces solutions that provide noticeably higher tourist expenditure with less instability of international tourism demand than the status quo. Theoretical contributions and practical implications for tourism policy makers and destination marketers are discussed.","Ai","University of York"
"The impact of different types of NHS expenditure on health : Marginal cost per QALY estimates for England for 2016/17.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197618/","Martin, Stephen; Claxton, Karl Philip; Lomas, James","March 2023","English data from 2003 to 2012 suggests that it costs the NHS £10,000 to generate an additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY). This estimate relates to all NHS expenditure and no attempt was made to explore possible heterogeneity within this total. Different types of expenditure - such as secondary care, primary care and specialized commissioning - may have different productivities and estimates of these may help policymakers decide where additional investment is most beneficial. We use the two-stage least squares estimator and data for 2016 to explore the mortality response to three types of healthcare expenditure. Three specifications are estimated for each type of expenditure: backward selection and regularized regression are used to identify parsimonious specifications, and a full specification with all covariates is also estimated. The regression results are combined with information about survival and morbidity disease burden to calculate the marginal cost per QALY for each type of expenditure: the most conservative results suggest that this is about £8,000 for locally (CCG) commissioned services, while estimates for specialized commissioning and primary care are more uncertain. When this heterogeneity is taken into account, the estimated marginal cost per QALY for all NHS expenditure increases slightly, from about £6,000 to £7,000. Our results suggest that additional investment is likely to be most productive in primary care and in locally commissioned services.","Ai","University of York"

"High-efficiency circularly polarized emission from liquid-crystalline platinum complexes.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198602/","Fan, Peng; Fang, Zhou; Wang, Shengyue","October 2022","Realizing both a high emission efficiency and luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) in circularly polarized solution processable organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) remains a significant challenge. In this contribution, two chiral phosphorescent liquid crystals based on cyclometalated platinum complexes are prepared, in which the chiral s-2-methyl-1‑butyl group is introduced into the cyclometalating ligand and the mesogenic fragment is attached to the periphery of the ancillary ligand. The platinum complexes exhibit both smectic and chiral nematic phases as evidenced by polarized optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and small-angle X-ray diffraction. Remarkably, a high photoluminescent quantum efficiency of over 78% and clear circularly polarized luminescent signal with gPL of about 10–2 are observed for the complexes. Further, solution-processed CP-OLEDs show maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of over 15% and strong circularly polarized electroluminescent signals with a gEL ≈ 10–2. This research demonstrates that both liquid crystallinity and the number of chiral centers play key roles in improving the chiroptical property, paving the way for a new approach for the design of high-efficiency CPL emitters.","Ai","University of York"
"Discursive alignment of trafficking, rights and crime control.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/190565/","Pinto, Mattia","May 2022","Since the 1990s, human trafficking has become the battleground for competing discourses on human rights and penality. While rights solutions are generally presented as in opposition to crime-control measures, in the context of anti-trafficking interventions, rights-based initiatives and criminal governance are often linked together both discursively and in practice. Drawing on the findings of Discourse Analysis of 120 texts about trafficking, this paper explores how dominant discourses and alternative voices construct the relationship between human rights and penality. It is contended that penality is framed as a crucial tenet of human rights. Dominant discourses (the ‘law enforcement’ and the ‘victims first’ discourses) link human rights to state coercive action, seen as a necessary component of their effectiveness. Alternative voices (the ‘incompatibility’ and the ‘transformative justice’ discourses) reject the appropriateness of penal intervention, but they end up preserving what they denounce.","Ai","University of York"

This paper examines whether it is in fact necessary to jointly model yields in multiple countries, as proposed by a handful of recent studies. We show that there is little convincing evidence that would point to such a need. The reason is that bond yields are forward-looking variables: any relevant information about foreign countries is likely to be already reflected in today’s domestic yield curve","Ai","University of York"
"Intramuscular coherence enables robust assessment of modulated supra-spinal input in human gait : an inter-dependence study of visual task and walking speed.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199362/","Zipser-Mohammadzada, Freschta; Scheffers, Marjelle Fredie; Conway, Bernard A","May 2023","Intramuscular high-frequency coherence is increased during visually guided treadmill walking as a consequence of increased supra-spinal input. The influence of walking speed on intramuscular coherence and its inter-trial reproducibility need to be established before adoption as a functional gait assessment tool in clinical settings. Here, fifteen healthy controls performed a normal and a target walking task on a treadmill at various speeds (0.3 m/s, 0.5 m/s, 0.9 m/s, and preferred) during two sessions. Intramuscular coherence was calculated between two surface EMG recordings sites of the Tibialis anterior muscle during the swing phase of walking. The results were averaged across low-frequency (5-14 Hz) and high-frequency (15-55 Hz) bands. The effect of speed, task, and time on mean coherence was assessed using three-way repeated measures ANOVA. Reliability and agreement were calculated with the intra-class correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman method, respectively. Intramuscular coherence during target walking was significantly higher than during normal walking across all walking speeds in the high-frequency band as obtained by the three-way repeated measures ANOVA. Interaction effects between task and speed were found for the low- and high-frequency bands, suggesting that task-dependent differences increase at higher walking speeds. Reliability of intramuscular coherence was moderate to excellent for most normal and target walking tasks in all frequency bands. This study confirms previous reports of increased intramuscular coherence during target walking, while providing first evidence for reproducibility and robustness of this measure as a requirement to investigate supra-spinal input.Trial registration Registry number/ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03343132, date of registration 2017/11/17.","Ai","University of York"
"Dual-tasking while using two languages : Examining the cognitive resource demands of cued and voluntary language production in bilinguals.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199363/","de Bruin, Angela; McGarrigle, Ronan","April 2023","The way bilinguals switch languages can differ depending on the context. In cued dual-language environments, bilinguals select a language in response to environmental cues (e.g., a monolingual conversation partner). In voluntary dual-language environments, bilinguals communicating with people who speak the same languages can use their languages more freely. The control demands of these types of language-production contexts, and the costs of language switches, have been argued to differ (Adaptive Control Hypothesis, Green & Abutalebi, 2013). Here we used a dual-task paradigm to examine how cued and voluntary bilingual production differ in cognitive resources used. Forty Mandarin-English bilinguals completed two language-switching paradigms as the primary task; one in response to cues and one while using two languages freely. At the same time, they also had to respond to the pitch of tones (secondary task). Response times (RTs) on the secondary task, as well as naming times on the primary task, were shorter in the voluntary- than cued-naming condition. Task workload ratings were also higher in the cued- than voluntary-naming condition. This suggests more attentional resources are needed in a cued-naming context to monitor cues and select languages accordingly. However, the costs associated with switching from one language to the other were similar in both voluntary and cued naming contexts. Thus, while cued naming might be more effortful overall, cued and voluntary switching recruited similar levels of cognitive resources.","Ai","University of York"
