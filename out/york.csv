"Ancient DNA evidence for the ecological globalization of cod fishing in medieval and post-medieval Europe.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/193255/","Martínez-García, Lourdes; Ferrari, Giada; Cuevas, Angélica","September 2022","Understanding the historical emergence and growth of long-range fisheries can provide fundamental insights into the timing of ecological impacts and the development of coastal communities during the last millennium. Whole-genome sequencing approaches can improve such understanding by determining the origin of archaeological fish specimens that may have been obtained from historic trade or distant water. Here, we used genome-wide data to individually infer the biological source of 37 ancient Atlantic cod specimens (ca 1050-1950 CE) from England and Spain. Our findings provide novel genetic evidence that eleventh- to twelfth-century specimens from London were predominantly obtained from nearby populations, while thirteenth- to fourteenth-century specimens were derived from distant sources. Our results further suggest that Icelandic cod was indeed exported to London earlier than previously reported. Our observations confirm the chronology and geography of the trans-Atlantic cod trade from Newfoundland to Spain starting by the early sixteenth century. Our findings demonstrate the utility of whole-genome sequencing and ancient DNA approaches to describe the globalization of marine fisheries and increase our understanding regarding the extent of the North Atlantic fish trade and long-range fisheries in medieval and early modern times.","Marine","University of York"
"The nature and extent of evidence on methodologies for monitoring and evaluating marine spatial management measures in the UK and similar coastal waters : a systematic map.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/176484/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Copping, Joshua; Mukherjee, Nibedita","May 2021","Background Anthropogenic degradation of marine ecosystems is widely accepted as a major social-ecological problem. The growing urgency to manage marine ecosystems more effectively has led to increasing application of spatial management measures (marine protected areas [MPAs], sectoral [e.g. fishery] closures and marine spatial planning [marine plans]). Understanding the methodologies used to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures against social, economic, and ecological outcomes is key for designing effective monitoring and evaluation programmes. Methods We used a pre-defined and tested search string focusing on intervention and outcome terms to search for relevant studies across four bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, 39 organisational websites, and one specialist data repository. Searches were conducted in English and restricted to the period 2009 to 2019 to align with current UK marine policy contexts. Relevant studies were restricted to UK-relevant coastal countries, as identified by key stakeholders. Search results were screened for relevance against pre-defined eligibility criteria first at title and abstract level, and then at full text. Articles assessed as not relevant at full text were recorded with reasons for exclusion. Two systematic map databases of meta-data and coded data from relevant primary and secondary studies, respectively, were produced. Review findings Over 19,500 search results were identified, resulting in 391 relevant primary articles, 33 secondary articles and 49 tertiary reviews. Relevant primary articles evaluated spatial management measures across a total of 22 social, economic and ecological outcomes; only 2.8% considered all three disciplines, with most focused exclusively on ecological (67.8%) or social (13.3%) evaluations. Secondary articles predominately focused on ecological evaluations (75.8%). The majority of the primary and secondary evidence base aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of MPAs (85.7% and 90.9% respectively), followed by fisheries closures (12.5%; 3.0%) with only 1.8% of primary, and 6.1% of secondary, articles focused on marine plans or on MPAs and fisheries closures combined. Most evaluations reported within primary articles were conducted for a single site (60.4%) or multiple individual sites (32.5%), with few evaluating networks of sites (6.9%). Secondary articles mostly evaluated multiple individual sites (93.9%). Most (70.3%) primary articles conducted principal evaluations, i.e. basic description of effects; 29.4% explored causation; and 0.3% undertook benefit evaluations. Secondary articles predominately explored causation (66.7%) with the remainder conducting principal evaluations. Australia (27.4%), the USA (18.4%) and the UK (11.3%) were most frequently studied by primary articles, with secondary articles reporting mostly global (66.7%) or European (18.2%) syntheses. Conclusions The systematic map reveals substantial bodies of evidence relating to methods of evaluating MPAs against ecological outcomes. However, key knowledge gaps include evaluation across social and economic outcomes and of overall merit and/or worth (benefit evaluation), as well as of: marine plans; networks of sites; real-time, temporary or seasonal closures; spatial management within offshore waters, and lagoon or estuary environments. Although the evidence base has grown over the past two decades, information to develop comprehensive evaluation frameworks remains insufficient. Greater understanding on how to evaluate the effectiveness of spatial management measures is required to support improved management of global ocean resources and spaces.","Marine","University of York"

"A drowned Mesolithic shell midden complex at Hjarnø Vesterhoved,Denmark and its wider significance.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/172405/","Moe Astrup, Peter; Benjamin, Jonathan; Stankiewicz, Francis","February 2021","Anthropogenic shell accumulations (shell middens), often of great size, occur in their tens of thousands around the world’s coastlines. They mostly date from the Mid-Holocene onwards and are frequently taken as symptomatic of a Postglacial ‘revolution’ involving world-wide population growth and intensification in exploitation of marine resources. However, the comparative rarity of earlier deposits may have as much to do with Postglacial sea-level rise and the loss of evidence from earlier palaeoshorelines as with genuine socio-economic trends. Here we investigate the underwater Mesolithic (Ertebølle) shellmidden of Hjarnø Vesterhoved in Denmark, one of the first underwater shell middens to be systematically verified as an anthropogenic shell deposit in a region world-famous for its many hundreds of Ertebølle shell mounds on the present shoreline. We show how a combination of geophysical survey, coring, excavation, stratigraphic interpretation and macroscopic analysis of midden contents can be used to identify underwater deposits, to unravel their taphonomic and post-depositional history in relation to surrounding sediments, and to distinguish between cultural and natural agencies of shell accumulation and deformation. We demonstrate the presence of an intact underwater shell-midden deposit dated at 5400–5100 cal BC, one of the earliest in Denmark. We demonstrate the usefulness of such material in giving new information about early coastal subsistence economies and greater precision to the measurement of palaeosea levels. We discuss the implications of our results for an improved understanding of the Mesolithic record in Denmark and of biases in the archaeological record of Late Pleistocene and Early-to-Mid-Holocene coastal contexts. We emphasise the importance of researching more fully the geomorphological and taphonomic processes that affect the accumulation, destruction, burial, preservation and visibility of underwater archaeological deposits, the need to extend underwater investigations more widely and to more deeply submerged palaeoshorelines, and the combination of methods required to advance such investigations.","Marine","University of York"
"Characteristics of shallow and mesophotic environments of the Pemba Channel, Tanzania : implications for management and conservation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/168877/","Edeye, Kennedy Osuka; McClean, Colin John; Stewart, Bryce Donald","November 2020","Information on the spatial distribution of habitats and vulnerable species is important for conservation planning. In particular, detailed knowledge on connectivity of marine ecosystems in relation to depth and seafloor characteristics is crucial for any proposed conservation and management actions. Yet, the bulk of the seafloor remains undersampled, unstudied and unmapped, thereby limiting our understanding of connections between shallow and deep-water communities. Recent studies on mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) have highlighted the western Indian Ocean as a particularly understudied marine region. Here we utilise an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to collect in-situ temperature, oxygen concentration, bathymetry, acoustic backscatter and photographic data on benthic communities from shallow (<30 m) and mesophotic (30-150 m) depths at selected sites in the Greater Pemba Channel, Tanzania . Further, we use generalised additive models (GAMs) to determine useful predictors of substratum (hard and sand) and benthic community type (coral, turf algae, fleshy algae, fish). Our results revealed the presence of a complex seafloor characterised by pockmarks, steep slopes, submarine walls, and large boulders. Photographs confirmed the presence of MCE composed of corals, algae and fishes on the eastern margins of the Pemba Channel. The GAMs on the presence and absence of benthic community explained 35% to 91% of the deviance in fish and fleshy algae assemblages, respectively. Key predictors of the distribution of hard substrata and the coral reef communities were depth, showing the upper boundary of MCEs present at 30-40 m, and seafloor slope that showed more occurrences on steep slopes. The upper 100 m of water column had stable temperatures (25-26°C) and oxygen concentrations (220- 235 μmol/l). We noted the presence of submarine walls, steeply inclined bedrock, which appeared to support a highly bio-diverse community that may be worthy of particular conservation measures. Our results also highlight the capability of using marine robotics, particularly autonomous vehicles, to fill the knowledge gap for areas not readily accessible with surface vessels, and their potential application in the initial survey and subsequent monitoring of Marine Protected Areas.","Marine","University of York"
"Age-estimate evidence for a complex Middle to Late Pleistocene fluvial terrace aggradation spanning more than a 100-kyr interglacial–glacial cycle at Sutton Cross, eastern England.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/165436/","Langford, H. E.; Griffiths, H.; Horne, D. J.","September 2020","At Sutton Cross, eastern England, an undated River Nene 2nd Terrace was known to record a complex sequence of late Middle to Upper Pleistocene deposits. Amino acid geochronology was carried out for samples from four separate facies associations in order to provide a chronostratigraphic framework for this complex deposit. Each sample comprised three specimens of Bithynia tentaculata opercula. The intracrystalline protein decomposition results confirmed the sedimentary stratigraphic interpretation previously proposed for the site, i.e., that fossiliferous sediments yielding fully temperate Mollusca and Ostracoda faunas are equivalent in age to marine isotope stage (MIS) 7. Palaeotemperature reconstructions based on the Ostracoda fauna (July: +14 to +26 °C; January: ―4 to +5/+3 °C) embrace those of today at this location (July: +17 °C; January +3 °C). The sedimentary succession at Sutton Cross comprises vertically aggraded packages with a probable maximum age of MIS 8 and minimum age of MIS 2. This aggradation pattern (and age range) is also common to downstream sedimentary successions at Whittlesey, and is counterintuitive to the traditional terrace stratigraphy approach that expects laterally aggrading downstepping packages. The preservation of sediments of MIS 7 age and older at Sutton Cross with no evidence of glacial overriding places constraints on recently proposed late Middle Pleistocene regional ice limits.","Marine","University of York"
"The Effects of Aquaculture and Marine Conservation on Cultural Ecosystem Services : An Integrated Hedonic – Eudaemonic Approach.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/175181/","Spanou, Elisavet; Kenter, Jasper O.; Graziano, Marcello","June 2020","Understanding the cultural contributions of ecosystems is essential for recognising how environmental policy impacts on human well-being. We developed an integrated cultural ecosystem services (CES) valuation approach involving non-monetary valuation through a eudaemonic well-being questionnaire and monetary valuation through hedonic pricing. This approach was applied to assess CES values on the west coast of Scotland. The impact of scenic area and marine protected area (MPA) designations on CES values and potential trade-offs with aquaculture, an increasingly important provisioning ecosystem service in the region, were investigated. Results confirmed a eudaemonic well-being value structure of seven factors: engagement and interaction with nature, place identity, therapeutic value, spiritual value, social bonds, memory/transformative value, and challenge and skill. Visibility of, but not proximity to aquaculture negatively influenced housing prices. In contrast, proximity to MPAs and visibility of scenic areas increased property values. All eudaemonic well-being value factors were positively and significantly associated with scenic areas and a subset of these with MPAs. The integration of the two methods can provide decision-makers with a more comprehensive picture of CES values, their relation to conservation policies and interactions and trade-offs with other activities and services.","Marine","University of York"
"Integrating stakeholder knowledge through modular cooperative participatory processes for marine spatial planning outcomes (CORPORATES).","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/191740/","Slater, Anne Michelle; Irvine, Katherine N.; Byg, Anja A.","May 2020","Management of the sea is increasingly complex, riddled with uncertainty and necessitates involvement from researchers across disciplines and stakeholders from multiple policy and practice sectors. This article discusses “The Cooperative Participatory Evaluation of Renewable Technologies on Ecosystem Services” (CORPORATES) research project, which developed an innovative and practical method of linking ecological processes, ecosystem services and benefits. The research was conducted in the context of licensing decisions for offshore wind farms in the North Sea (Scotland, UK). A set of linked, modular participatory processes were developed to foster cross-sector stakeholder engagement. It employed an exchange of ecological, legal, social, economic and cultural knowledge around marine ecosystem services. Workshop exercises included participatory mapping, benefit identification, and developing an understanding of linkages between ecosystem services, benefits, stakeholders’ activities and policy drivers through co-development of conceptual systems maps of the study area. The participatory exercises fostered meaningful dialogue across sectors and an ability to participate equally, despite initial differences in knowledge about ecosystem services. The development of conceptual systems maps facilitated productive discussion about trade-offs in relation to different policies. Reflective discussion identifies ways in which the developed processes could be integrated into future decision making. An assessment of the approach revealed that it operationalised a post normal science framework in terms of process oversight, multiple knowledge claims, and managing uncertainty. It developed a process that linked understanding of ecosystem functioning with the creation and implementation of policy thereby creating an ecosystem approach to marine spatial planning and licensing decisions, as required by law. This approach has extensive transferability to situations where stakeholder engagement is required to develop policy and provide feedback as part of a decision-making process. It is an engagement, outreach tool for communities and can help teach methods and processes for stakeholder engagement which enable new insights.","Marine","University of York"
"Emerging themes to support ambitious UK marine biodiversity conservation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/158671/","Rees, Sian E.; Sheehan, Emma V.; Stewart, Bryce Donald","February 2020","Healthy marine ecosystems provide a wide range of resources and services that support life on Earth and contribute to human wellbeing. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are accepted as an important tool for the restoration and maintenance of marine ecosystem structure, function, health and ecosystem integrity through the conservation of significant species, habitats, or entire ecosystems. In recent years there has been a rapid expansion in the area of ocean designated as an MPA. Despite this progress in spatial protection targets and the progressive knowledge of the essential interdependence between the human and the ocean system, marine biodiversity continues to decline, placing in jeopardy the range of ecosystem services benefits humans rely on. There is a need to address this shortcoming. Ambitious marine conservation: • Requires a shift from managing individual marine features within MPAs to whole-sites to enable repair and renewal of marine systems; • Reflects an ambition for sustainable livelihoods by fully integrating fisheries management with conservation (Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management) as the two are critically interdependent; • Establishes a world class and cost effective ecological and socio-economic monitoring and evaluation framework that includes the use of controls and sentinel sites to improve sustainability in marine management; and • Challenges policy makers and practitioners to be progressive by integrating MPAs into the wider seascape as critical functional components rather than a competing interest and move beyond MPAs as the only tool to underpin the benefits derived from marine ecosystems by identifying other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) to establish synergies with wider governance frameworks.","Marine","University of York"
"Options for managing human threats to high seas biodiversity.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/156565/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Hoppit, George; Townley, Adam","January 2020","Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) constitute 61% of the world’s oceans and are collectively managed by countries under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Growing concern regarding the deteriorating state of the oceans and ineffective management of ABNJ has resulted in negotiations to develop an international legally binding instrument (ILBI) for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction under UNCLOS. To inform these negotiations, we identified existing and emerging human activities and influences that affect ABNJ and evaluated management options available to mitigate the most pervasive, with highest potential for impact and probability of emergence. The highest-ranking activities and influences that affect ABNJ were fishing/hunting, maritime shipping, climate change and its associated effects, land-based pollution and mineral exploitation. Management options are diverse and available through a variety of actors, although their actions are not always effective. Area-based management tools (ABMTs), including marine protected areas (MPAs), were the only consistently effective option to mitigate impacts across high-ranked activities and influences. However, addressing land-based pollution will require national action to prevent this at its source, and MPAs offer only a partial solution for climate change. A new ABNJ ILBI could help unify management options and actors to conserve marine biodiversity and ensure sustainable use. Incorporating a mechanism to establish effective ABMTs into the ILBI will help deliver multiple objectives based on the ecosystem approach.","Marine","University of York"
"Effects of Sea Salt Aerosol Emissions for Marine Cloud Brightening on Atmospheric Chemistry : Implications for Radiative Forcing.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/156250/","Horowitz, Hannah M.; Holmes, Christopher; Wright, Alicia","January 2020","Marine cloud brightening (MCB) is proposed to offset global warming by emitting sea salt aerosols to the tropical marine boundary layer, which increases aerosol and cloud albedo. Sea salt aerosol is the main source of tropospheric reactive chlorine (Cly) and bromine (Bry). The effects of additional sea salt on atmospheric chemistry have not been explored. We simulate sea salt aerosol injections for MCB under two scenarios (212–569 Tg/a) in the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model, only considering their impacts as a halogen source. Globally, tropospheric Cly and Bry increase (20–40%), leading to decreased ozone (−3 to −6%). Consequently, OH decreases (−3 to −5%), which increases the methane lifetime (3–6%). Our results suggest that the chemistry of the additional sea salt leads to minor total radiative forcing compared to that of the sea salt aerosol itself (~2%) but may have potential implications for surface ozone pollution in tropical coastal regions.","Marine","University of York"
"Marine Conservation Begins at Home : How a Local Community and Protection of a Small Bay Sent Waves of Change Around the UK and Beyond.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/158673/","Stewart, Bryce Donald; Howarth, Leigh Michael; Wood, Howard L.","January 2020","The Firth of Clyde, on the west coast of Scotland, was once one of the most productive fishing grounds in Europe. However, successive decades of poor management and overfishing led to a dramatic loss of biodiversity and the collapse of finfish fisheries. In response, concerned local residents on the Isle of Arran, which lies in the middle of the Clyde, formed the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST) in 1995. After 13 years of campaigning, a small (2.67 km2) area in Lamlash Bay became Scotland’s first no-take zone (NTZ) in 2008, and only the second in the UK. Since protection, biodiversity has increased substantially, along with the size, age and density of commercially important species such as the king scallop, Pecten maximus, and the European lobster, Homarus gammarus. Arguably more important, however, is the influence the Lamlash Bay NTZ and COAST have had on UK marine protection in general. Most notably, detailed research has created a case study that clearly demonstrates the benefits of protection in an area where little such evidence is available. This case has been used repeatedly to support efforts for increased protection of UK waters to help rebuild marine ecosystems and enhance their resilience in an uncertain future. In Scotland specifically, lobbying by COAST led to the designation of a much larger marine protected area (MPA, >250 km2) around the south of Arran, one of 30 new MPAs in the country. Evidence from Lamlash Bay has supported development of strong protection for these MPAs, seeing off lobbyist efforts to weaken management. Arran’s conservation success has been recognized internationally and is inspiring greater involvement of local communities around the UK, and further afield, to take the destiny of their coastal waters into their own hands. Successful marine conservation begins at home.","Marine","University of York"
"What is the nature and extent of evidence on methodologies for monitoring and evaluating marine spatial management measures in UK and similar coastal waters? A systematic map protocol.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/154166/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Stewart, Bryce Donald; McKinley, Emma","October 2019","Background Anthropogenic degradation of marine ecosystems is widely accepted as a major social-ecological problem. The growing urgency to better manage marine ecosystems has led to the increasing application of ‘spatial management measures’ including marine protected areas, sectoral (e.g. fishery) closures, and marine spatial planning. However, the designation of varied spatial management regimes is just the first step; achievement of objectives relies upon effective implementation, monitoring, evaluation and adaptation. Despite spatial management being a core component of the marine management portfolio, to our knowledge, there is no systematic overview of the evidence on methodologies available, and employed, to monitor and evaluate their effectiveness across social, economic and ecological outcomes. Methods This systematic map will examine existing evidence describing methodologies for monitoring the effects, and evaluating the effectiveness, of marine spatial management across ecological, social and economic outcomes. Our aim is to provide a resource for decision-makers, primarily in the UK but also internationally, that supports effective marine management, and to describe the current evidence base. Identification and evaluation of relevant studies will therefore be restricted to coastal countries identified by our Stakeholder Group as being relevant to the UK, and searches will be restricted to the period 2009 to 2019 to align with the current UK policy context. Searches for relevant grey and academic literature, published in English, will be conducted in four bibliographic search engines, Google Scholar, 38 organisational websites and one specialist data repository. Eligibility screening will be conducted first at title and abstract level, and then at full text. Coding and meta-data extraction from eligible studies will include: bibliographic information, general information about the spatial management measure studied, and methodological information on the monitoring and evaluation undertaken. Consistency checking amongst reviewers will be undertaken during screening, coding and data extraction phases. The outcome of the systematic map will be a database that displays the meta-data of identified relevant studies. Findings will be presented in a descriptive report detailing the evaluation approaches and analytical methodologies employed, and data collection methods applied and/or data required by relevant studies to inform evaluations on the effectiveness of marine spatial management measures.","Marine","University of York"
"A fulfilled human life : Eliciting sense of place and cultural identity in two UK marine environments through the Community Voice Method.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/150123/","Ainsworth, Gillian B.; Kenter, Jasper O.; O'Connor, Sebastian","August 2019","Human impacts on the marine environment threaten the wellbeing of hundreds of millions of people. Marine environments are a common-pool resource (CPR) and one of their major management challenges is how to incorporate the value of ecosystem services to society in decision-making. Cultural ecosystem services (CES) relate to the often intangible benefits people receive from their interactions with the natural environment and contribute to individual and collective human wellbeing. Priority knowledge gaps include the need to better understand shared values regarding CES, and how to effectively integrate these values into decision-making. We filmed 40 Community Voice Method interviews with marine stakeholders in two areas of the UK to improve on the valuation of coastal and marine CES. Results show that cultural benefits including sense of place, aesthetic pleasure and cultural identity were bi-directional, contributed directly to a ‘fulfilled human life’ and were associated with charismatic marine life and biodiversity. Other-regarding self-transcendence values were salient underscoring a desire for sustainable marine management. We critically reflect on our analytical framework that integrates aspects of the UK National Ecosystem Assessment and IPBES conceptual frameworks. The thematic codebook developed for this study could prove useful for future comparative studies in other marine CES contexts. We propose that values-led management could increase the efficacy of marine planning strategies.","Marine","University of York"
"Understanding Iodine Chemistry Over the Northern and Equatorial Indian Ocean.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/150493/","Mahajan, Anoop S.; Tinel, Liselotte; Sarkar, Amit","February 2019","Observations of halogen oxides, ozone, meteorological parameters, and physical and biogeochemical water column measurements were made in the Indian Ocean and its marine boundary layer as a part of the Second International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2). The expedition took place on board the oceanographic research vessel Sagar Nidhi during 4–22 December 2015 from Goa, India, to Port Louis, Mauritius. Observations of mixed layer depth, averaged temperature, salinity, and nitrate concentrations were used to calculate predicted iodide concentrations in the seawater. The inorganic iodine ocean-atmosphere flux (hypoiodous acid [HOI] and molecular iodine [I2]) was computed using the predicted iodide concentrations, measured atmospheric ozone, and wind speed. Iodine oxide (IO) mixing ratios peaked at 0.47 ± 0.29 pptv (parts per trillion by volume) in the remote open ocean environment. The estimated iodide concentrations and HOI and I2 fluxes peaked at 200/500 nM, 410/680 nmol·m−2·day−1, and 20/80 nmol·m−2·day−1, respectively, depending on the parameterization used. The calculated fluxes for HOI and I2 were higher closer to the Indian subcontinent; however, atmospheric IO was only observed above the detection limit in the remote open ocean environment. We use NO2 observations to show that titration of IO by NO2 is the main reason for this result. These observations show that inorganic iodine fluxes and atmospheric IO show similar trends in the Indian Ocean marine boundary layer, but the impact of inorganic iodine emissions on iodine chemistry is buffered in elevated NOx environments, even though the estimated oceanic iodine fluxes are higher.","Marine","University of York"
"Elemental Problems, Methodical Solutions : Expertise, Ecology and Entertainment in the Study of Marine Mammals.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/147390/","Rees, Amanda","June 2019","This paper examines the development of socio-technical strategies and practices that have been developed, by both experts and laypeople, to study and to display the socio-ecology of marine mammals. The late 1950s saw the emergence of a distinctively different approach to the understanding of animal behaviour and biology – one that focused on the observation and (sometimes) manipulation of animals as they lived under natural conditions. In the first instance, it was applied to land animals, birds and insects in Europe, America and the territories that either were, or had been, under colonial control. By the early 21st century, however, many wild-living colonies of whales, dolphins and seals were being studied by researchers, and many of them – as with terrestrial animals – were not just known individually, but could be placed on a generations-deep family tree. This paper will explore how this transition was managed. It will show how it was possible for scientists to study live animal behaviour in an element inimical to human survival, and how researchers borrowed key methodological practices from other human activities in order to access their research subjects. It will show how these socio-technical developments intersected with the efforts to display marine mammals on land and above all, it will demonstrate the ways in which the agency of the animals under observation had an essential role to play in the emergence of cetology as a profession and as a form of knowledge.","Marine","University of York"

This review identifies the minor, intermediate and major impediments (respectively defined as ‘bottlenecks, showstoppers and train-wrecks’) to marine management, resulting from a 4-year analysis of national, regional and European reports. Most of the problems are linked to the resistance of countries to collaborate and to the inability to integrate the work already carried out under other pieces of legislation. The European countries will need to better integrate and coordinate their actions in marine management in the second cycle of the MSFD, in order to achieve its final goal of Good Environmental Status as well as the objectives of other environmental policies.","Marine","University of York"

In this study, a single-step microwave process was used to depolymerise a range of macroalgae native to the United Kingdom, producing a growth medium suitable for microbial fermentation. The medium contained a range of mono- and polysaccharides as well as macro- and micronutrients that could be metabolised by the oleaginous yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima. Among twelve macroalgae species, the brown seaweeds exhibited the highest fermentation potential, especially the kelp Saccharina latissima. Applying a portfolio of ten native M. pulcherrima strains, yeast growth kinetics, as well as production of lipids and 2-phenylethanol were examined, with productivity and growth rate being strain dependent. On the 2 L scale, 6.9 g L−1 yeast biomass – a yield of 0.14 g g−1 with respect to the supplied macroalgae – containing 37.2% (w/w) lipid was achieved through utilisation of the proteins, mono- and polysaccharides from S. latissima, with no additional enzymes. In addition, the yeast degraded a range of fermentation inhibitors released upon microwave processing at high temperatures and long holding times. As macroalgae can be cultured to food grade, this system offers a novel, potentially low-cost route to edible microbial oils as well as a renewable feedstock for oleochemicals.","Marine","University of York"
"The interplay between economics, legislative power and social influence examined through a social-ecological framework for marine ecosystems services.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/137199/","Martino, Simone; Tett, Paul; Kenter, Jasper","September 2018","In the last 15 years, conservation has shifted increasingly towards perspectives based on the instrumental value of nature, where what counts is what provides benefits to humans. The ecosystem services framework embraces this vision of nature through monetary valuation of the environment to correct market failures and government distortions that hinder efficient allocation of public goods, including goods and services provided by biodiversity and ecosystems. The popularity of this approach is reflected in different countries legislation; for instance, US, EU and UK have introduced economic criteria for comparing costs and benefits of environmental policies in protecting ecosystem services. From an operational perspective, the ecosystem services framework requires ecologists to estimate how the supply of services is affected by changes in the functionality and/or the extent of ecosystems; and economists to identify how changes in the supply affect the flow of direct and indirect benefits to people. However, this approach may be simplistic when faced with the complexity of social-ecological systems. We investigated this for three different marine services: assimilative capacity of waste, coastal defense and renewable energy. We find that economic valuation could provide efficient and fair allocations in the case of assimilative capacity, but leads to social clashes between outputs generated by cost benefit analysis and citizens’ expectation in the case of coastal defense. In the case of renewable energy, controversies can be generated by regulatory mechanisms that are not necessarily aligned with the interests of industry or important social groups. We conclude that there is a need to integrate perspectives arising from utilitarian allocation of resources with those involving legislation and communal values in order to reconcile conflicting interests and better sustain marine social-ecological systems.","Marine","University of York"
"Evidence gaps and biodiversity threats facing the marine environment of the United Kingdom’s Overseas Territories.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/139484/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Fieldhouse, Philip; McClean, Colin John","November 2018","Understanding the evidence base and identifying threats to the marine environment is critical to ensure cost-effective management and to identify priorities for future research. The United Kingdom (UK) government is responsible for approximately 2% of the world’s oceans, most of which belongs to its 14 Overseas Territories (UKOTs). Containing biodiversity of global significance, and far in excess of the UK mainland’s domestic species, there has recently been a strong desire from many of the UKOTs, the UK Government, and NGOs to improve marine management in these places. Implementing evidence-based marine policy is, however, challenged by the disparate nature of scientific research in the UKOTs and knowledge gaps about the threats they face. Here, we address these issues by systematically searching for scientific literature which has examined UKOT marine biodiversity and by exploring publicly available spatial threat data. We find that UKOT marine biodiversity has received consistent, but largely low, levels of scientific interest, and there is considerable geographical and subject bias in research effort. Of particular concern is the lack of research focus on management or threats to biodiversity. The extent and intensity of threats vary amongst and within the UKOTs but unsurprisingly, climate change associated threats affect them all and direct human stressors are more prevalent in those with higher human populations. To meet global goals for effective conservation and management, there is an urgent need for additional and continued investment in research and management in the Overseas Territories, particularly those that have been of lesser focus.","Marine","University of York"
"Measuring site fidelity and homesite-to-pre-spawning site connectivity of Bonefish (Albula vulpes): using mark-recapture to inform habitat conservation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/138204/","Boucek, R.E.; Lewis, Justin P.; Stewart, Bryce Donald","October 2018","Effective marine habitat protection requires life history information, including identification of connected adult habitats and spawning sites, and movement information throughout those areas. Here, we implemented a mark-recapture study in the Bahamas Archipelago to estimate patterns of site fidelity, and to determine what homesites are connected to pre-spawning sites of economically important Bonefish (Albula vulpes) across multiple islands. We captured over 7,000 Bonefish via seine netting, marked them with dart tags, and relied on fishing guides and anglers to report recaptures on Abaco, Grand Bahama, and Andros. Mark-recapture results from the three islands showed that 60-80% of Bonefish were recaptured within 5 km of their tagging site. Across the three islands, mean distance between mark and recapture was less than 11 km, suggesting space use that is tractable for effective marine reserve implementation. We also found that pre-spawning sites housed individuals from multiple homesites that were separated by distances up to 75 km. With these connections in mind, conserving Bonefish spawning biomass necessitates habitat protection in multiple home areas, along migratory corridors, and at pre-spawn and spawning locations. Our case study illustrates how mark-recapture of a C&R species can be used to identify habitats for protection. Information from this mark-recapture study contributed to the designation of six National Parks aimed at protecting habitats used by Bonefish, as well as other spatially overlapping species.","Marine","University of York"

IO was observed almost ubiquitously in the open ocean with larger mixing ratios south of the Polar Front (PF). Contrary to previous reports, IO was not positively correlated to sea surface temperature (SST)/salinity, or negatively to chlorophyll a. Over the whole expedition, SST showed a weak negative correlation with respect to IO while chl a was positively correlated. North of the PF, chl a showed a strong positive correlation with IO. The computed HOI and I2 fluxes do not show any significant correlation with atmospheric IO. Simulations with the global CAM-Chem model show a reasonably good agreement with observations north of the PF but the model fails to reproduce the elevated IO south of the PF indicating that the current emission parametrizations are not sufficient to explain iodine chemistry in the Southern Indian Ocean.","Marine","University of York"
"Structure and function of a glycoside hydrolase family 8 endoxylanase from Teredinibacter turnerae.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/137106/","Fowler, Claire A; Hemsworth, Glyn R; Cuskin, Fiona","July 2018","The biological conversion of lignocellulosic matter into high-value chemicals or biofuels is of increasing industrial importance as the sector slowly transitions away from nonrenewable sources. Many industrial processes involve the use of cellulolytic enzyme cocktails - a selection of glycoside hydrolases and, increasingly, polysaccharide oxygenases - to break down recalcitrant plant polysaccharides. ORFs from the genome of Teredinibacter turnerae, a symbiont hosted within the gills of marine shipworms, were identified in order to search for enzymes with desirable traits. Here, a putative T. turnerae glycoside hydrolase from family 8, hereafter referred to as TtGH8, is analysed. The enzyme is shown to be active against β-1,4-xylan and mixed-linkage (β-1,3,β-1,4) marine xylan. Kinetic parameters, obtained using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection and 3,5-dinitrosalicyclic acid reducing-sugar assays, show that TtGH8 catalyses the hydrolysis of β-1,4-xylohexaose with a k cat/K m of 7.5 × 10 7  M -1  min -1 but displays maximal activity against mixed-linkage polymeric xylans, hinting at a primary role in the degradation of marine polysaccharides. The three-dimensional structure of TtGH8 was solved in uncomplexed and xylobiose-, xylotriose- and xylohexaose-bound forms at approximately 1.5 Å resolution; the latter was consistent with the greater k cat/K m for hexasaccharide substrates. A 2,5B boat conformation observed in the -1 position of bound xylotriose is consistent with the proposed conformational itinerary for this class of enzyme. This work shows TtGH8 to be effective at the degradation of xylan-based substrates, notably marine xylan, further exemplifying the potential of T. turnerae for effective and diverse biomass degradation.","Marine","University of York"
"Ecological connectivity across ocean depths : implications for protected area design.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/134977/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Roberts, Callum Michael","August 2018","Coastal nations have embarked on a rapid program of marine protected area (MPA) establishment, incentivised by the approaching 2020 deadline of United Nations global marine protection targets. Alongside, efforts are underway to extend protection into areas beyond national jurisdiction through a new international legally binding instrument. These developments are welcome but there are risks that in meeting them, nations will still fail to supply adequate protection to marine life. An increasing number of MPAs protect the seabed while the water column remains open to fishing. This is because vulnerable habitats in need of protection are disproportionately perceived to be those on the seabed, while the water column is viewed as much less at risk. The seabed and water column are, however, inextricably linked. Transitions between human-defined vertical ocean zones are blurred, with animals and oceanographic features moving across depths. Here, we explore a rapidly growing literature on ecological and environmental connections through the water column, and between the water column and the seabed, to consider whether vertically stratified management is justified from an ecological standpoint. We find that emerging research increasingly links upper-ocean communities and processes to seabed ecology and biogeochemistry suggesting that exploitation of the water column is likely to have a significant and widely distributed footprint in the deep-sea. We conclude that there is a strong a priori case for surface to seabed protection within MPAs, and that this should be the default, precautionary approach to safeguard intact ecosystems with as near to natural function as possible.","Marine","University of York"
"Can national management measures achieve good status across international boundaries? : a case study of the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast sub-region.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/129429/","Cavallo, Marianna; Elliott, Mike; Quintino, Victor","April 2018","Coastal countries have historically implemented management measures to improve the status of their national marine waters and little effort has been made to take coordinated actions to improve the status of the entire region or sub- region of which they are part. At the European level, the adoption of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to remedy this deficiency and to promote coordination among countries and an integrated management of the marine environment. The MSFD requires each country to propose and adopt a programme of measures to achieve Good Environmental Status of the regional seas. This study compares the programmes of measures of the three countries of the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast sub-region – France, Portugal and Spain – presenting a novel use of multivariate analyses using semi-quantitative policy information. Among the four North-East Atlantic sub-regions, this study area was chosen because it showed the lowest levels of coherence during the first phase of the implementation of the MSFD, according to the European Commission assessment. The results show the differences among the three programmes, confirming the difficulties that neighbouring countries face when they are required to adopt common approaches in the implementation of this multi-sectoral Directive. Most of the measures developed in the sub-region address marine biodiversity but this is through a wide range of actions, covering different pressures and different species/habitats. The integration with other legislation is more similar between Spain and France and differs between these and Portugal. The three countries also recognise the lack of knowledge to perform the economic analysis, in particular in quantifying the costs of and social benefits derived from their measures. It is concluded here that a better use of the regional and European coordination structures is needed to fill the gaps in knowledge and to exchange good practices. More political will is necessary to take action at European and international level to mitigate the impact of those socio-economic activities through joint programmes, for which Community funding is available.","Marine","University of York"
"Does bathymetry drive coastal Whale Shark (Rhincodon typus) aggregations?","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/131887/","Copping, Joshua; Stewart, Bryce Donald; McClean, Colin John","May 2018","Background The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is known to aggregate in a number of coastal locations globally, however what causes these aggregations to form where they do is largely unknown. This study examines whether bathymetry is an important driver of coastal aggregation locations for R. typus through bathymetry’s effect on primary productivity and prey availability. This is a global study taking into account all coastal areas within R. typus’ range. Methods R. typus aggregation locations were identified through an extensive literature review. Global bathymetric data were compared at R. typus aggregation locations and a large random selection of non-aggregation areas. Generalised linear models were used to assess which bathymetric characteristic had the biggest influence on aggregation presence. Results Aggregation sites were significantly shallower than non-aggregation sites and in closer proximity to deep water (the mesopelagic zone) by two orders of magnitude. Slope at aggregation sites was significantly steeper than non-aggregation sites. These three bathymetric variables were shown to have the biggest association with aggregation sites, with up to 88% of deviation explained by the GLMs. Discussion The three key bathymetric characteristics similar at the aggregation sites are known to induce upwelling events, increase primary productivity and consequently attract numerous other filter feeding species. The location of aggregation sites in these key areas can be attributed to this increased prey availability, thought to be the main reason R. typus aggregations occur, extensively outlined in the literature. The proximity of aggregations to shallow areas such as reefs could also be an important factor why whale sharks thermoregulate after deep dives to feed. These findings increase our understanding of whale shark behaviour and may help guide the identification and conservation of further aggregation sites.","Marine","University of York"
"Benefits and impediments for the integrated and coordinated management of European seas.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/125129/","Cavallo, Marianna; Elliott, Michael; Touza-Montero, Julia Maria","September 2017","New multi-sectoral policies with a regional implementation are developed when maritime states recognise the importance of managing the marine environment under an ecosystem-perspective rather than a use-perspective. In Europe, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is the first attempt to promote an integrated management of the seas from the coastline to the limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone. This paper shows that, nine years from the MSFD adoption, there remain several ecological, economic, social and governance challenges. Using information gathered in a dedicated survey of the European Union Marine Strategy Coordination Group and in the recent literature the paper identifies the obstacles preventing a successful regional cooperation and policy integration. The survey indicates that the MSFD coordination structures are, in general, well-developed but there is an apparent lack of political will to coordinate actions at the regional level. Member States request greater flexibility to implement the Directive but they put their national interests before the benefit of a coherent and integrated approach for the entire region. Differences in budget, economic sector predominance, lack of staff and the MSFD short time-scale are identified as the factors that can hamper cooperation. These have produced recommendations of possible strategies for optimising regional coordination structures which respect the subsidiarity principle underpinning the MSFD.","Marine","University of York"
"The trade-off between tidal-turbine array yield and impact on flow: A multi-objective optimisation problem.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/119470/","du Feu, R.J.; Funke, S.W.; Kramer, S.C.","July 2017","Abstract This paper introduces a new approach for investigating trade-offs between different societal objectives in the design of tidal-turbine arrays. This method is demonstrated through the trade-off between the yield of an array, and the extent to which that array alters the flow. This is posed as a multi-objective optimisation problem, and the problem is investigated using the array layout optimisation tool OpenTidalFarm. Motivated by environmental concerns, OpenTidalFarm is adapted to not only maximise array yield but also to minimise the effect of the array upon the hydrodynamics of the region, specifically the flow velocity. A linear scalarisation of the multi-objective optimisation problem is solved for a series of different weightings of the two conflicting objectives. Two idealised test scenarios are evaluated and in each case a set of Pareto solutions is found. These arrays are assessed for the power they generate and the severity of change they cause in the flow velocity. These analyses allow for the identification of trade-offs between these two objectives, while the methods proposed can similarly be applied to the two key societal objectives of energy production and conservation, thus providing information that could be valuable to stakeholders and policymakers when making decisions on array design.","Marine","University of York"
"Particulate phases are key in controlling dissolved iron concentrations in the (sub)tropical North Atlantic.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/127894/","Milne, Angela; Schlosser, Christian; Wake, Bronwyn D.","February 2017","The supply and bioavailability of iron (Fe) controls primary productivity and N2 fixation in large parts of the global ocean. An important, yet poorly quantified, source to the ocean is particulate Fe (pFe). Here we present the first combined dataset of particulate, labile-particulate (L-pFe), and dissolved Fe (dFe) from the (sub)tropical North Atlantic. We show a strong relationship between L-pFe and dFe, indicating a dynamic equilibrium between these two phases whereby particles “buffer” dFe and maintain the elevated concentrations observed. Moreover, L-pFe can increase the overall “available” (L-pFe + dFe) Fe pool by up to 55%. The lateral shelf flux of this available Fe was similar in magnitude to observed soluble aerosol-Fe deposition, a comparison that has not been previously considered. These findings demonstrate that L-pFe is integral to Fe cycling and hence plays a role in regulating carbon cycling, warranting its inclusion in Fe budgets and biogeochemical models.","Marine","University of York"
"Trade-offs in marine protection : Multi-species interactions within a community-led temperate marine reserve.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/105519/","Howarth, Leigh Michael; Dubois, Pascal; Gratton, Paul","August 2016","This study investigated the effects of a community-led temperate marine reserve in Lamlash Bay, Firth of Clyde, Scotland, on commercially important populations of European lobster (Homarus gammarus), brown crab (Cancer pagurus), and velvet swimming crabs (Necora puber). Potting surveys conducted over 4 years revealed significantly higher catch per unit effort (cpue 109% greater), weight per unit effort (wpue 189% greater), and carapace length (10-15 mm greater) in lobsters within the reserve compared with control sites. However, likely due to low levels of recruitment and increased fishing effort outside the reserve, lobster catches decreased in all areas during the final 2 years. Nevertheless, catch rates remained higher within the reserve across all years, suggesting the reserve buffered these wider declines. Additionally, lobster cpue and wpue declined with increasing distance from the boundaries of the marine reserve, a trend which tag-recapture data suggested were due to spillover. Catches of berried lobster were also twice as high within the reserve than outside, and the mean potential reproductive output per female was 22.1% greater. It was originally thought that higher densities of lobster within the reserve might lead to greater levels of aggression and physical damage. However, damage levels were solely related to body size, as large lobsters >110 mm had sustained over 218% more damage than smaller individuals. Interestingly, catches of adult lobsters were inversely correlated with those of juvenile lobsters, brown crabs, and velvet crabs, which may be evidence of competitive displacement and/or predation. Our findings provide evidence that temperate marine reserves can deliver fisheries and conservation benefits, and highlight the importance of investigating multispecies interactions, as the recovery of some species can have knock-on effects on others.","Marine","University of York"

The integration of cultural ecosystem services (CES) into the ecosystem services framework remains a challenge due to the difficulties associated with defining, articulating and measuring CES. We operationalise a novel framework developed by the UK National Ecosystem Assessment that identifies CES as the interactions between environmental spaces (i.e. physical localities or landscapes), and the activities that occur there. We evaluate the benefits of the CES provided by 151 UK marine sites to recreational sea anglers and divers, using subjective well-being indicators. Factor analysis of an online questionnaire with 1220 participants revealed multiple CES benefits that contribute to human wellbeing e.g. including ‘engagement with nature’, ‘place identity’ and ‘therapeutic value’. In addition to regional differences, we also found that biophysical attributes of sites, such as the presence of charismatic species and species diversity, were positively associated with provision of CES benefits. The study provides evidence that could be used to inform designation of protected areas. The indicators used in the study may also be adapted for use across a range of marine and terrestrial spaces for improved integration of CES in environmental decision-making.","Marine","University of York"

In this paper we present the results of pollen analysis performed on cave hyena coprolites [Crocuta crocuta spelaea (Goldfuss, 1832)] from Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) sites of Cava Muracci (Cisterna di Latina, central Italy) and Tana delle Iene (Ceglie Messapica, southern Italy). This study provides new insights into the vegetation of the Late Pleistocene of peninsular Italy, until now known only through long pollen records. It also shows how the content of coprolites, combined with faunal data and geochronological investigations, can represent a potential integrative source of palaeoclimatic proxy data. Our results indicate that the surroundings of both of the hyena dens were characterised by a patchy landscape with open lowlands dominated by steppe and grassland vegetation, while a few mesophilous and thermophilous trees were present in more humid areas, probably along the marine coast and inland. The harsh glacial climate appears to have been milder at Cava Muracci than at Tana delle Iene. This could be due either to the different environmental features of the two sites or to the high climatic variability that occurred during MIS3.","Marine","University of York"

The conversion of dimethyl sulfide to sulfuric acid is the dominant source of oceanic secondary aerosol. Ocean emitted iodine can also produce aerosol.

Iodine aerosol concentrations are highest in the tropical marine boundary layer (MBL) averaging 5.2 ng (I) m −3 with monthly maximum concentrations of 90 ng (I) m −3. These masses are small compared to sulfate (0.75% of MBL burden, up to 11% regionally) but are more significant compared to dimethyl sulfide sourced sulfate (3% of the MBL burden, up to 101% regionally). In the preindustrial, iodine aerosol makes up 0.88% of the MBL burden sulfate mass and regionally up to 21%.

For the first time, ΔR values were reliably determined for these coastal waters, and also for the first time a ΔR was calculated for the Late Pleistocene in Atlantic Iberia. Pairs of coeval samples of different carbon reservoirs selected from Upper Paleolithic (Late Pleistocene) and Mesolithic (Early Holocene) contexts yielded ΔR weighted mean values of −117±70 14C yr and −105±21 14C yr, respectively. These values show oceanographic conditions characterized by a reduced offset between atmospheric and surface water 14C contents, suggesting a nonexistent or a very weak upwelling and some stratification of the water column. Similar oceanographic conditions have been recorded in other areas of Atlantic Iberia during the Holocene, such as off Andalusian and northwestern Galician coasts. Results not only provide useful information on environmental conditions but also a framework to obtain more precise and reliable absolute chronologies for the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene in northern Iberia.","Marine","University of York"

Coordination at international level is particularly important during the implementation of environmental policies aimed at reducing the widespread pressures derived from activities, such as shipping and fishing. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to protect and improve the status of a wide range of ecosystem components with a regional focus, promoting cooperation among countries and integration with other environmental policies. In 2014, the European Commission assessed the level of adequacy, consistency and coherence achieved by Member States during the implementation of the first phase of the MSFD and hence this paper focuses on the cross-border coherence and coordination within one marine region in order to achieve the goals of the Directive. In particular, it identifies and analyses the main differences among the results of the implementation of the first phase of the MSFD across the North-East Atlantic region. This analysis shows that, in general, the use of existing data, methodologies and targets from related environmental policies corresponds to the higher levels of coherence among countries while a limited use of such policies produces less coherence. This suggests that the European Commission, Regional Seas Conventions and Member States should work together to identify the real connection between the MSFD and other policies to make a proper use of existing data and approaches and to harmonise different policy objectives. In particular, the review shows what might be termed a 'paradox of coherence' amongst Member States where coherence of action has to be achieved within a European policy of subsidiarity, the act of Member States having control over the way they implement framework directives. This can be regarded as a fundamental flaw in having a 'Framework Directive' instead of the greater control in a 'Directive'","Marine","University of York"
"Sessile and mobile components of a benthic ecosystem display mixed trends within a temperate marine reserve.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/84754/","Howarth, Leigh Michael; Pickup, Sarah; Evans, Lowri","March 2015","Despite recent efforts to increase the global coverage of marine protected areas (MPAs), studies investigating the effectiveness of marine protected areas within temperate waters remain scarce. Furthermore, out of the few studies published on MPAs in temperate waters, the majority focus on specific ecological or fishery components rather than investigating the ecosystem as a whole. This study therefore investigated both the dynamics of benthic communities as well as fish populations within a recently established, fully protected marine reserve in Lamlash Bay, Isle of Arran, United Kingdom, over a four year period. A combination of photo and diver surveys revealed live maerl (Phymatolithon calcareum), macroalgae, sponges, hydroids, feather stars and eyelash worms (Myxicola infundibulum) to be significantly more abundant within the marine reserve than on surrounding fishing grounds. Likewise, the overall composition of epifaunal communities in and outside the reserve was significantly different. Both results are consistent with the hypothesis that protecting areas from fishing can encourage seafloor habitats to recover. In addition, the greater abundance of complex habitats within the reserve appeared to providing nursery habitat for juvenile cod (Gadus morhua) and scallops (Pecten maximus and Aequipecten opercularis). In contrast, there was little difference in the abundance of mobile benthic fauna, such as crabs and starfish, between the reserve and outside. Similarly, the use of baited underwater video cameras revealed no difference in the abundance and size of fish between the reserve and outside. Limited recovery of these ecosystem components may be due to the relatively small size (2.67 km2) and young age of the reserve (< 5 years), both of which might have limited the extent of any benefits afforded to mobile fauna and fish communities. Overall, this study provides evidence that fully protected marine reserves can encourage seafloor habitats to recover, which in turn, can create a number of benefits that flow back to other species, including those of commercial importance.","Marine","University of York"

Annual dive surveys from 2010 to 2013 showed the abundance of juvenile scallops to be significantly greater within the marine reserve than outside. Generalised linear models revealed this trend to be significantly related to the greater presence of macroalgae and hydroids growing within the boundaries of the reserve. These results suggest that structurally complex habitats growing within the reserve have substantially increased spat settlement and/or survival. The density of adult king scallops declined threefold with increasing distance from the boundaries of the reserve, indicating possible evidence of spillover or reduced fishing effort directly outside and around the marine reserve. However, there was no difference in the mean density of adult scallops between the reserve and outside. Finally, the mean age, size, and reproductive and exploitable biomass of king scallops were all significantly greater within the reserve. In contrast to king scallops, the population dynamics of queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis) fluctuated randomly over the survey period and showed little difference between the reserve and outside. Overall, this study is consistent with the hypothesis that marine reserves can encourage the recovery of seafloor habitats, which, in turn, can benefit populations of commercially exploited species, emphasising the importance of marine reserves in the ecosystem-based management of fisheries.","Marine","University of York"

In particular it identifies a marked increase in imported cod from the thirteenth century AD. That trend continued into the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, after a short downturn, perhaps attributable to the impact of the Black Death, in the mid fourteenth century. The detailed pattern of fluctuating abundance illustrates the potential of archaeological information that is now available from the high-quality urban excavations conducted in London and similar centres during recent decades.","Marine","University of York"

The UK is also home to the largest queen scallop fishery out of all of Europe. However, concerns have been raised about the effects of this recent growth of UK scallop fisheries among scientists and conservation bodies, as well as amongst the public following recent media campaigns (e.g. Hugh’s Fish Fight). This is because the majority of scallop landings (95%) are made by vessels towing scallop dredges, a type of fishing gear known to cause substantial environmental impacts. In addition, several scallop stocks are showing signs of overexploitation and there is concern over future impacts of ocean warming and acidification. Although, there have been several recent improvements in the management of scallop fisheries in parts of the UK, information on many scallop stocks around the UK is still lacking. This report therefore proposes that better monitoring and stock assessments are needed for these scallop fisheries and stocks. With recent legislation soon to result in the development of a new network of marine protected areas (MPAs) around the UK, and improved management of fisheries in European Marine Sites, now is a crucial time to review the UK scallop dredge fishery and its impacts on the wider environment so that this new legislation can support a sustainable future for the UK scallop fishery. This report was therefore commissioned by the Sustainable Inshore Fisheries Trust with the aim of collating existing knowledge on the management and environmental impacts of scallop fisheries around the UK.","Marine","University of York"

The discussion assesses the impact of factors such as topography and the distribution of resources on land and on the seacoast, taking account of geographical variation and changes in geology, sea levels and palaeoclimate. The merits of northern and southern routes of movement at either end of the Red Sea are compared. All the evidence indicates that there has been no land connection at the southern end since the beginning of the Pliocene period, but that short sea crossings would have been possible at lowest sea-level stands with little or no technical aids. More important than the possibilities of crossing the southern channel is the nature of the resources available in the adjacent coastal zones. There were many climatic episodes wetter than today, and during these periods water draining from the Arabian escarpment provided productive conditions for large mammals and human populations in coastal regions and eastwards into the desert. During drier episodes the coastal region would have provided important refugia both in upland areas and on the emerged shelves exposed by lowered sea level, especially in the southern sector and on both sides of the Red Sea. Marine resources may have offered an added advantage in coastal areas, but evidence for their exploitation is very limited, and their role has been over-exaggerated in hypotheses of coastal colonization.","Marine","University of York"

He was setting out his party’s list of priorities in advance of the 2024 election and ‘to stop small boats’ (of asylum-seekers crossing the English Channel) was fifth on the list, in a nation beset by economic woes, health-care crisis and Brexit backwash. For Australian viewers, this was déjà vu. From 2018, a brushed metal trophy in the form of a silhouette of an Asian fishing boat (dis)graced a desk in the office of then Australian Prime Minister (and sometime Immigration Minister) Scott Morrison. An inscription on its hull infamously boasted, ‘I stopped these’, referring to the so-called ‘suspected illegal entry vessels’ of asylum-seekers that the ideologues of xenophobia just called ‘the boats’. In all the talk of ‘turning back the boats’ from Australia and the United Kingdom, there is not much focus on the actual people in them. This is deliberate and consequential. The Howard government developed this approach at around the time of the ‘Tampa Crisis’ in 2001 and the Australian resort to what became known as ‘the Pacific Solution’. In this chapter, we argue that Australia’s ‘Pacific Solution’, along with Britain’s current ‘Australian Solution’, as it might be called, constitute state violence deliberately designed to harm asylum seekers, mostly unlawfully and certainly without regard for international law, to deter them from exercising their rights to claim asylum. The respective state policies and their implementation are a cynical deterrent to irregular maritime arrivals, structured in racism, without respect for the humanity of the victims or the international humanitarian principles to which both the nations are professedly committed. They are instituted in response to populist panic over (certain, racialised) asylum seekers that is marketed by mass media and manipulated irresponsibly for political gain.","Ai","University of York"

"Teacher personality domains and facets : Their unique associations with student-ratings of teaching quality and teacher enthusiasm.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202902/","Burić, Irena; Butkovic, Ana; Kim, Lisa","August 2023","Background Previous research on the relationship between teacher personality and teaching performance yielded mixed results and typically considered only the broad personality domains while neglecting the narrower personality facets that constitute the domains. Aim The aim of this study was to examine the incremental value of teacher Big Five personality facets in explaining student-ratings of teaching quality and teacher enthusiasm. Samples In total, 1067 teachers and 18,814 of their students from 73 secondary schools in Croatia participated in the study. Method Teachers self-reported their personality whereas students rated the teaching quality and displayed enthusiasm of their teachers. Each teacher was rated by one class of students. Results The bifactor-(S-1) multilevel structural equation models for each Big Five personality domain showed that both the general reference factor and the specific factors explained the variance in student-ratings of teaching quality and teacher enthusiasm. Conclusions A more fine-grained approach to examining the effects of teacher personality at different levels of hierarchy might be helpful for identifying specific parts of teacher personality with the greatest explanatory power in predicting teaching performance.","Ai","University of York"
"Ethanol, not Water, Should Be Used as the Dispersant When Measuring Microplastic Particle Size Distribution by Laser Diffraction.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202157/","Fang, Zheng; Sallach, Brett; Hodson, Mark Edward","August 2023","Size distribution is a crucial characteristic of microplastics (MPs). A typical method for measuring this property is wet laser diffraction. However, when measuring size distributions of MPs, despite it being a poor dispersant for many MPs, water is commonly selected, potentially limiting the reliability of reported measurements. To evaluate dispersant suitability, different aqueous concentrations of ethanol (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 wt%) and aqueous solutions of 0.001 wt% Triton X-100 and a mixture comprising 10 wt% sodium pyrophosphate and 10 wt% methanol were used as dispersants in a laser granulometer (Mastersizer 2000) to determine particle size distributions (PSDs) of granular polyethene MP35, MP125 and MP500 particles (nominally described as < 35, < 125 and, < 500 μm in size). The reliability of the reported PSDs depended on the dispersant used and size of primary MPs. With increasing ethanol concentrations, PSD curves of MP35 particles shifted from multi-modal to mono-modal distributions. The measured size distribution reduced from 1588.7 - 4.5 μm in water to 39.9 - 0.1 μm in 100 wt% ethanol. Generally, as ethanol concentration increased uncertainty associated with the PSD parameters decreased. Although Triton X-100 and the mixed solution also showed better dispersion than water, their measured sizes and COV (%) were notably larger than those for 100 wt% ethanol. Similar trends were observed for larger-sized MP125 and MP500 particles, but differences in PSD curves, PSD parameters, and COV (%) among dispersants were less pronounced. In all dispersants, the volume weighted mean diameters (VWMD) in 100 wt% ethanol (MP35: 14.1 μm, MP125: 102.5 μm, MP500: 300.0 μm) were smallest and close to microscopy results (MP35: 14.6 μm, MP125: 109.0 μm, MP500: 310.6 μm). Therefore, for accurate determinations of the PSDs of MP by wet laser diffraction, ethanol rather than water should be used.","Ai","University of York"
"The impact of COVID-19 on mental health service utilisation in England.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200266/","Villasenor-Lopez, Adrian; Gaughan, James Michael; Aragon Aragon, Maria Jose Monserratt","May 2023","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on population mental health and the need for mental health services in many countries, while also disrupting critical mental health services and capacity, as a response to the pandemic. Mental health providers were asked to reconfigure wards to accommodate patients with COVID-19, thereby reducing capacity to provide mental health services. This is likely to have widened the existing mismatch between demand and supply of mental health care in the English NHS. We quantify the impact of these rapid service reconfigurations on activity levels for mental health providers in England during the first thirteen months (March 2020–March 2021) of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use monthly mental health service utilisation data for a large subset of mental health providers in England from January 1, 2015 to March 31, 2021. We use multivariate regression to estimate the difference between observed and expected utilisation from the start of the pandemic in March 2020. Expected utilisation levels (i.e. the counterfactual) are estimated from trends in utilisation observed during the pre-pandemic period January 1, 2015 to February 31, 2020. We measure utilisation as the monthly number of inpatient admissions, discharges, net admissions (admissions less discharges), length of stay, bed days, number of occupied beds, patients with outpatient appointments, and total outpatient appointments. We also calculate the accumulated difference in utilisation from the start of the pandemic period. There was a sharp reduction in total inpatient admissions and net admissions at the beginning of the pandemic, followed by a return to pre-pandemic levels from September 2020. Shorter inpatient stays are observed over the whole period and bed days and occupied bed counts had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels by March 2021. There is also evidence of greater use of outpatient appointments, potentially as a substitute for inpatient care.","Ai","University of York"

Here, we used a combined computational and behavioural approach to reveal critical image dimensions for face recognition. Behavioural data were collected using a sorting and matching task with unfamiliar faces and a recognition task with familiar faces. Principal components analysis was used to reveal the dimensions across which the shape and texture of faces in these tasks varied. We then asked which image dimensions were able to predict behavioural performance across these tasks. We found that the ability to predict behavioural responses in the unfamiliar face tasks increased when the early PCA dimensions (i.e. those accounting for most variance) of shape and texture were removed from the analysis. Image similarity also predicted the output of a computer model of face recognition, but again only when the early image dimensions were removed from the analysis. Finally, we found that recognition of familiar faces increased when the early image dimensions were removed, decreased when intermediate dimensions were removed, but then returned to baseline recognition when only later dimensions were removed. Together, these findings suggest that early image dimensions reflect ambient changes, such as changes in viewpoint or lighting, that do not contribute to face recognition. However, there is a narrow band of image dimensions for shape and texture that are critical for the recognition of identity in humans and computer models of face recognition.","Ai","University of York"
"Classifying 1D elementary cellular automata with the 0-1 test for chaos.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200580/","Terry-Jack, Mohammed; O'Keefe, Simon","May 2023","We utilise the 0-1 test to automatically classify elementary cellular automata. The quantitative results of the 0-1 test reveal a number of advantages over Wolfram’s qualitative classification. For instance, while almost all rules classified as chaotic by Wolfram were confirmed as such by the 0-1 test, there were two rules which were revealed to be non-chaotic. However, their periodic nature is hidden by the high complexity of their spacetime patterns and not easy to see without looking very carefully. Comparing each rule’s chaoticity (as quantified by the 0-1 test) against its intrinsic complexity (as quantified by its Chua complexity index) also reveals a number of counter-intuitive discoveries; i.e. non-chaotic dynamics are not only found in simpler rules, but also in rules as complex as chaos.","Ai","University of York"

In an ironic twist, the quantisation effect which usually introduces errors, has been utilised to remove noise from lossy reconstructions.","Ai","University of York"
"Comparative of machine learning classification strategies for electron energy loss spectroscopy: Support vector machines and artificial neural networks.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202260/","del-Pozo-Bueno, Daniel; Kepaptsoglou, Demie; Peiró, Francesca","August 2023","Machine Learning (ML) strategies applied to Scanning and conventional Transmission Electron Microscopy have become a valuable tool for analyzing the large volumes of data generated by various S/TEM techniques. In this work, we focus on Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) and study two ML techniques for classifying spectra in detail: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Firstly, we systematically analyze the optimal configurations and architectures for ANN classifiers using random search and the tree-structured Parzen estimator methods. Secondly, a new kernel strategy is introduced for the soft-margin SVMs, the cosine kernel, which offers a significant advantage over the previously studied kernels and other ML classification strategies. This kernel allows us to bypass the normalization of EEL spectra, achieving accurate classification. This result is highly relevant for the EELS community since we also assess the impact of common normalization techniques on our spectra using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), revealing a strong bias introduced in the spectra once normalized. In order to evaluate and study both classification strategies, we focus on determining the oxidation state of transition metals through their EEL spectra, examining which feature is more suitable for oxidation state classification: the oxygen K peak or the transition metal white lines. Subsequently, we compare the resistance to energy loss shifts for both classifiers and present a strategy to improve their resistance. The results of this study suggest the use of soft-margin SVMs for simpler EELS classification tasks with a limited number of spectra, as they provide performance comparable to ANNs while requiring lower computational resources and reduced training times. Conversely, ANNs are better suited for handling complex classification problems with extensive training data.","Ai","University of York"
"Generalized quantile and expectile properties for shape constrained nonparametric estimation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198648/","Dai, Sheng; Kuosmanen, Timo; Zhou, Xun","April 2023","Convex quantile regression (CQR) is a fully nonparametric approach to estimating quantile functions, which has proved useful in many applications of productivity and efficiency analysis. Importantly, CQR satisfies the quantile property, which states that the observed data is split into proportions by the CQR frontier for any weight in the unit interval. Convex expectile regression (CER) is a closely related nonparametric approach, which has the following expectile property: the relative share of negative deviations is equal to the weight of negative deviations. The first contribution of this paper is to extend these quantile and expectile properties to the general set of shape constrained nonparametric functions. The second contribution is to relax the global concavity assumptions of the CQR and CER estimators, developing the isotonic nonparametric quantile and expectile estimators. Our third contribution is to compare the finite sample performance of the CQR and CER approaches in the controlled environment of Monte Carlo simulations.","Ai","University of York"

Yet we know little about how such perspective-challenging experiences come about in gameplay. In response, we used systematic self-observation diaries and micro-phenomenological interviews to capture players’ (n=15) lived experience of perspective challenges in purposely sampled games including Hatoful Boyfriend, The Stanley Parable, or Papers, Please. We found a sequence of trigger, reflection, and transformation constituting perspective-challenging experiences, matching Mezirow’s model of transformative learning. Most of these were game-related or ‘endo-game’, suggesting that medium self-reflection could be an overlooked part of everyday game reflection and appreciation. Reflections were accompanied by a wide range of emotions, including frequent epistemic emotions, and emotions could change drastically even during short gameplay experiences. Actual perspective change or transformation was rare. We construct a model of granular types of triggers, reflections, and transformations that can aid reflective game design.","Ai","University of York"

These measures have proved exceedingly litigious since they were first introduced for tobacco products in the 1960s because they infringe manufacturers’ fundamental rights to (intellectual) property and to freedom of expression. There is growing evidence that these measures are being adopted in industries beyond tobacco products, notably alcohol and sugary/fatty foods. Their continued expansion is likely to give rise to a fresh wave of litigation across jurisdictions as trade mark owners operating in these industries seek to challenge their validity. Understanding what these potential challenges will entail constitutes a timely and relevant endeavour. To this end, this chapter: (a) explores how different trade mark-restrictive measures encroach on trade mark rights; (b) tracks their expansion across industries and jurisdictions in an ambitious global mapping exercise; (c) engages in a comprehensive comparative review of existing case law for tobacco products to identify the range of legal arguments that plaintiffs could rely upon in future challenges; and (d) discusses the normative implications of the continued expansion of trade mark-restrictive measures to promote public health.","Ai","University of York"

"The camp as market frontier : refugees and the spatial imaginaries of capitalist prospecting in Kenya.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202148/","Brankamp, Hanno; De Jong, Sara; MacKinder, Sophia","August 2023","This article critically interrogates the ambitions of humanitarians, policymakers, and their corporate partners to fundamentally remake both camp economies and the refugees who inhabit them. It draws on a unique set of elite interviews with key actors from a network of organisations driving ‘innovative’ humanitarian projects in the Kakuma camp and Kalobeyei settlement in Kenya. We identify their shared spatial imaginaries which, first, reconfigure camps from spaces of dependency to capitalist frontiers of the market and, second, produce a normative construction of refugee personhood that corresponds to this space. We show that the camp as market frontier is imagined as an enabling environment that both redeems and creates the otherwise ‘subdued’ humanity of refugees through allowing their flourishing as rational capitalist subjects. Against popular depictions of refugees as ‘burdens’, we find that our interlocutors present camp refugees as entrepreneurial capitalists-in-the-making who are only inhibited by their own lack of training, humanitarian welfarism, and the deficiency of a proto-capitalist environment. And yet this latent surplus population is thought to live alongside camp paupers whose value cannot easily be made legible within market logics geared towards 'productivity'. The stratification of camp inhabitants in this way signals the (re)production of an authorised version of refugee 'being' that resonates with the objectives of exclusionary marketisation agendas. While the optimism expressed in imaginaries of economic potential and thriving may appear seductive, in that these spatial stories promise to restore the ‘dignity’ of refugees, we argue that they ultimately enable less virtuous economic practices and conceal the complicity of global corporations and financial institutions in perpetuating the exploitative operations of capital.","Ai","University of York"

We examine the effects of increasing trawl fisheries’ selectivity through the application of a size-spectrum model to a “continental shelf system” in the NW Mediterranean. This system is sustained by detritus, as background resource, and by benthic invertebrates that channel the energy to the fish community. The “continental shelf system” in our model consists of three components: 1) demersal and benthic fish and invertebrate species modelled by size spectrum dynamics, 2) carrion and 3) detritus. The model was able to exemplify the effects of changes in fishing patterns on the different biological components of the shelf system. According to the model outputs, in the short term the main target species, hake and red mullet, would be the main beneficiaries of the increased net selectivity and reduction of fishing effort. Discards reduction would have negligible effects. Despite the positive outcomes, this exercise was not exempt of challenges, mainly due to the data-demanding nature of the approach applied to a system with high diversity of life-histories and feeding strategies of invertebrate and fish species. And yet, our work is a first and crucial step to understand the size-spectrum dynamics of a continental shelf ecosystem subjected to fishery activities.","Ai","University of York"

To ensure that long-term ventilation decisions incorporate the perspectives of stakeholders, it is vital that empirical evidence is gathered to substantiate frameworks and guidance on shared decision-making for long-term ventilation. This systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis aimed to clarify what shared decision-making constitutes in relation to long-term ventilation initiation for children and young people (<21 years). METHODS: A systematic review of qualitative research was undertaken. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science. RESULTS: Findings from 13 studies were included representative of 363 caregivers and 143 healthcare professional experiences. Components that support shared decision-making included acknowledging the unique positionality of caregivers and ensuring caregivers were informed about the implications of long-term ventilation. Beneficial qualities of engagement between stakeholders included honest, clear and timely dialogue using lay, tactful and sensitive language. CONCLUSION: Our findings clarify components and approaches supportive of shared decision-making in discussions about long-term ventilation. This review therefore provides a valuable resource to implement shared decision-making practices in the context of long-term ventilation decisions for children and young people.","Ai","University of York"
"Identifying Run-time Monitoring Requirements for Autonomous Systems through the Analysis of Safety Arguments.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200065/","Hawkins, Richard David; Ryan Conmy, Philippa Mary","April 2023","It is crucial that safety assurance continues to be managed for autonomous systems (AS) throughout their operation. This can be particularly challenging where AS operate in complex and dynamic environments. The importance of effective safety monitoring in ensuring the safety of AS through-life is already well documented. These current approaches often rely on utilising monitored information that happens to be available, or are reliant solely on engineering judgement to determine the requirements. Instead, we propose to use a systematic analysis of the safety case as the basis for determining the run-time monitoring requirements. Safety cases are created for AS prior to deployment in order to demonstrate why they are believed to be sufficiently safe to go into operation. The safety case is therefore inevitably based upon predictions and assumptions about the system and its operation which may become untrue due to changes post-deployment. Our approach identifies specific run-time monitoring requirements for AS based upon a dialectic analysis of the safety case developed for the system. The advantage of the approach described is that it is systematic (through explicit consideration of elements of the safety case for the AS) and provides a way to justify the sufficiency of the resulting monitoring requirements (through creating explicit links the safety claims made about the AS).","Ai","University of York"
"The Impact of Training Data Shortfalls on Safety of AI-based Clinical Decision Support Systems.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200068/","Ryan Conmy, Philippa Mary; Ozturk, Berk; Habli, Ibrahim","April 2023","Decision support systems with Artificial intelligence (AI) and specifically Machine Learning (ML) components present many challenges when assuring trust in operational performance, particularly in a safety-critical domain such as healthcare. During operation the Human in/on The Loop (HTL) may need assistance in determining when to trust the ML output and when to override it, particularly to prevent hazardous situations. In this paper, we consider how issues with training data shortfalls can cause varying safety performance in ML. We present a case study using an ML-based clinical decision support system for Type-2 diabetes related co-morbidity prediction (DCP). The DCP ML component is trained using real patient data, but the data was taken from a very large live database gathered over many years, and the records vary in distribution and completeness. Research developing similar clinical predictor systems describe different methods to compensate for training data shortfalls, but concentrate only on fixing the data to maximise the ML performance without considering a system safety perspective. This means the impact of the ML's varying performance is not fully understood at the system level. Further, methods such as data imputation can introduce a further risk of bias which is not addressed. This paper combines the use of ML data shortfall compensation measures with exploratory safety analysis to ensure all means of reducing risk are considered. We demonstrate that together these provide a richer picture allowing more effective identification and mitigation of risks from training data shortfalls.","Ai","University of York"

We present a computational cognitive model to predict response time and response choice to moral dilemmas using valuations as input. Cultural similarities in moral judgment are explained by a culturally stable set of valuations that drives choices that aid survival. Corresponding cultural differences are explained by changes in a decisional bias parameter that accounts for differences in the perceived costs of making various kinds of decisional errors.

This paper proposes a novel internal feedback mechanism for a CPG model designed to generate leg- spine coordinated locomotion in a quadruped robot with an active spine. This mechanism enables the CPG to independently control the frequency and amplitude of the stance and swing durations while also modifying the definition of stance and swing phases to generate more gaits. The CPG model’s results are demonstrated on a simulated ”tensegrity quadruped robot” called TQbot, which features a flexible spine with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF). By adjusting the parameters, the CPG model can gen- erate gaits with leg-spine coordination and uses the spine for turning.","Ai","University of York"

Data augmentation is an effective technique in alleviating data scarcity, reducing the time-consuming and expensive data collection and labelling processes. Despite their potential, existing data augmentation techniques primarily focus on simple geometric and colour space transformations, like noise, flipping and resizing, producing datasets with limited diversity. When the augmented dataset is used for testing the Deep Learning models, the derived results are typically uninformative about the robustness of the models. We address this gap by introducing GENFUZZER, a novel coverage-guided data augmentation fuzzing technique for Deep Learning models underpinned by generative AI. We demonstrate our approach using widely-adopted datasets and models employed for image classification, illustrating its effectiveness in generating informative datasets leading up to a 26% increase in widely-used coverage criteria.","Ai","University of York"

The internal loading of the printed circuit board shield is not normally accounted for in Shielding Effectiveness measurements. The measurement jig used in this paper has internal loading in the form of a stripline that is used to measure the energy coupled into the shield. Normally this stripline is terminated in matched loads. In this paper we illustrate the effects on the measured Shielding Effectiveness of the printed circuit board shield of changing the terminations of the internal stripline and of the addition of extra absorbing material into the shield.","Ai","University of York"

"A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of surgical treatments for ingrown toenails part II: healing time, post-operative complications, pain, and participant satisfaction.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/203173/","Exley, Victoria Anne; Jones, Katherine; O'Carroll, Grace","August 2023","Background When performing nail surgery, clinicians must choose from a multitude of procedures and variations within each procedure. Much has been published to guide this decision making, but there are a lack of up to date robust systematic reviews to assess the totality of this evidence. Methods Five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and CENTRAL) and two registers (Clinicaltrials.gov and ISRCTN) were searched to January 2022 for randomised trials evaluating the effects of a surgical intervention(s) for ingrown toenails. Two independent reviewers screened records, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence. Data on co-primary outcomes of symptom relief and symptomatic regrowth were presented in our first paper. This paper presents data for the secondary outcomes and further discussion. Results Of 3,928 records identified, 36 randomised trials were included in the systematic review. Healing time appears to be reduced with shorter application of phenol. A reduced healing time was also apparent was with the addition of curettage, although this may also increase the risk of post-operative bleeding and pain. Post operative bleeding was also reportedly lower in people who received local anaesthetic with epinephrine but no tourniquet. Use of phenol with nail bed excision may decrease the risk of infection. Lower pain scores were reported when using partial matrixectomy and surgical interventions with phenol. Shorter duration of pain was reported with phenolisation and wedge resection. Participant satisfaction was high overall. Conclusion This second paper reports secondary outcomes from a robust systematic review of randomised trials on surgical treatment of ingrown toenails. Despite the large volume of clinical trials conducted on the topic, few clinical conclusions can be drawn due to the poor quality of these studies. Further high-quality clinical trials are needed to answer fundamental questions in the surgical treatment of ingrown toenails.","Ai","University of York"
