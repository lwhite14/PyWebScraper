"The ripple effects of CBDC-related news on Bitcoin returns: insights from the DCC-GARCH model.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15689/","Akin, I ; Khan, Z.M; Hameed, A; Satiroglu, H","September 2023","Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have emerged as a potential substitute for current payment methods, and, as such, major announcements, events and policy discussions regarding CBDCs have the potential to influence cryptocurrency returns. In light of this, the present study undertakes an in-depth analysis of the CoinMarketCap data between August 1, 2017 and April 1, 2022 by implementing the dynamic conditional correlation-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) model. The study reveals a noteworthy influence of news and events related to CBDCs on Bitcoin returns. Precisely, CBDC uncertainty index and CBDC attention index have resulted in significant fluctuations in Bitcoin returns, indicating that positive news can result in significant Bitcoin returns. The findings suggest that future expectations of investors regarding cryptocurrencies are shaped by CBDC-related news and events.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"The effectiveness of alcohol label information for increasing knowledge and awareness: a rapid evidence review.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15588/","Edmunds, C.E.R ; Gold, N; Burton, R; Smolar, M; Walmsley, M; Henn, C; Egan, M; Tran, A; Harper, H; Kroner Dale, M; Brown, H; Londakova, K; Sheron, N; Greaves, F","August 2023","Background:-   Consumers have difficulty understanding alcoholic units and low risk drinking guidelines (LRDG). Labelling may improve comprehension. The aims of this rapid evidence review were to establish the effectiveness of on-bottle labelling for (i) improving comprehension of health risks; (ii) improving comprehension of unit and/or standard drink information and/or LRDG, and (iii) reducing self-reported intentions to drink/actual drinking.  Methods:-   Electronic database searches were carried out (January 2008-November 2018 inclusive). Papers were included if they were: published in English; from an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development country; an experimental/quasi-experimental design. Papers were assessed for quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment tool. Ten papers were included. Most studies were moderate quality (n = 7).  Results:-   Five themes emerged: comprehension of health risks; self-reported drinking intentions; comprehension of unit/standard drink information and/or LRDG; outcome expectancies; and label attention. Labelling can improve awareness, particularly of health harms, but is unlikely to change behaviour. Improved comprehension was greatest for labels with unit information and LRDG.  Conclusions:-   Alcohol labelling can be effective in improving people’s comprehension of the health risks involved in drinking alcohol enabling them to make informed consumption decisions, and perhaps thereby provide a route to changing behaviour. Thus, effective alcohol labelling is an intervention that can be added to the broader suite of policy options. That being said, the literature reviewed here suggests that the specific format of the label matters, so careful consideration must be given to the design and placement of labels.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Extraction old and new: toxic legacies of mining the desert in southwestern Africa.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15498/","Hannis, M; Sullivan, S; Kryder-Reid, E; May, S","July 2023","This visual essay draws on a 2017 journey from the South African Cape to the Khan valley of Namibia, tracing toxic (deter)mining legacies of roots and routes of mineral extraction. Copper, ilmenite, diamond, zinc and uranium exploitations encounter indigenous presence and resistance as colonial and corporate mineral ‘rushes’ intersect with local realities and cultural landscapes. Environmental mitigation efforts and ‘offsetting’ schemes also leave toxic heritage in their wake as they greenwash profit-driven extractive agendas. Images from sites visited evoke the materialities and atmospheres of these localities, and connections between them.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Worldviews about change: their structure and their implications for understanding responses to sustainability, technology, and political change.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15438/","Bain, P.G; Bongiorno, R; Tinson, K; Heanue, A; Gómez, Á; Guan, Y; Lebedeva, N; Kashima, E; González, R; Chen, S.X; Blumen, S; Kashima, Y","July 2023","People hold different perspectives about how they think the world is changing or should change. We examined five of these “worldviews” about change: Progress, Golden Age, Endless Cycle, Maintenance, and Balance. In Studies 1–4 (total N = 2733) we established reliable measures of each change worldview, and showed how these help explain when people will support or oppose social change in contexts spanning sustainability, technological innovations, and political elections. In mapping out these relationships we identify how the importance of different change worldviews varies across contexts, with Balance most critical for understanding support for sustainability, Progress/Golden Age important for understanding responses to innovations, and Golden Age uniquely important for preferring Trump/Republicans in the 2016 US election. These relationships were independent of prominent individual differences (e.g., values, political orientation for elections) or context-specific factors (e.g., self-reported innovativeness for responses to innovations). Study 5 (N = 2140) examined generalizability in 10 countries/regions spanning five continents, establishing that these worldviews exhibited metric invariance, but with country/region differences in how change worldviews were related to support for sustainability. These findings show that change worldviews can act as a general “lens” people use to help determine whether to support or oppose social change.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Conceptualising headteachers’ leadership of technology in
schools across the United Kingdom during early coronavirus disease 2019.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15330/","Beauchamp, G; Joyce-Gibbons, A; Clarke, L; Hulme, M; Hamilton, L; Harvey, J.A","April 2023","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic brought seismic changes to schooling which few could have anticipated. Across the four countries of the UK, (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) urgent changes to the locus and focus of education were required. This paper conceptualises how headteachers led their schools in the use of digital technology as they adjusted to teaching and learning in the early stages of a UK wide school ‘lockdown’. The study uses data from extensive interviews with the headteachers of 12 schools across all phases of learning in schools in all four countries in the UK. The analysis uses elements of Cashman's et al.'s (2014) ‘leadership by convening’ lenses to conduct a threefold analysis of the transcripts: the direction of communications (internal/external); the timeframes (synchronous/asynchronous); and headteachers’ perceptions of how their digital technology helped them navigate challenges. These challenges are classified as: (a) technical – The solution required technology or technical expertise; (b) adaptive – The solution required a change in behaviour by at least one party in the communication process (internal or external); (c) organisational – solutions to these challenges contained both a technological and a behavioural component. A new model of leadership with technology is suggested.","Tech","Bath Spa University"

Given this reality, we, all educators, came together to find ways to understand and address some of these inequalities. As a product of this collaboration, we propose a methodological toolkit: a theoretical kaleidoscope to examine and critique the constitutive elements and dimensions of digital inequalities. We argue that such a tool is helpful when a critical attitude to examine ‘the ideology of digitalism’, its concomitant inequalities, and the huge losses it entails for human flourishing seems urgent. In the paper, we describe different theoretical approaches that can be used for the kaleidoscope. We give relevant examples of each theory. We argue that the postdigital does not mean that the digital is over, rather that it has mutated into new power structures that are less evident but no less insidious as they continue to govern socio-technical infrastructures, geopolitics, and markets. In this sense, it is vital to find tools that allow us to shed light on such invisible and pervasive power structures and the consequences in the daily lives of so many.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Exploring possible worlds: open and participatory tools for critical data literacy and fairer data culture.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14438/","Kuhn, C; Raffaghelli, J.E; Sangrà, A","December 2021","This chapter is inspired by the webinar I was invited to give earlier in 2020 as part of the project Fair Data Cultures in HE. My doctoral research looks into the interplay between structure, culture and students’ agency in the context of open educational practices in HE from a critical realist perspective. Thus, this chapter is being addressed from that standpoint. That is, looking into the deeper levels of social reality where young people are embedded, in particular, students’ relationship with open and participatory tools in HE. I will explore how educators can offer pedagogical opportunities for open educational practices that enable students’ explorative and critical mindset, so that they transcend the blind acceptance of the socio-political structures within which they are embedded. In so doing, they can question apparatuses and structures that perpetuate mechanisms of surveillance capitalism (Zuboff, S, The age of surveillance capitalism: the fight for a human future at the new frontier of power. Profile Books, 2019). Hopefully, students will be able to shape an alternative world in which they reflexively engage with alternative and more holistic digital practices.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Sustainable positive psychology interventions enhance primary teachers’ wellbeing and beyond – a qualitative case study in England.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15202/","Yeh, C. S-H; Barrington, R","February 2023","Positive psychology interventions (PPIs) have become an influential approach to foster teacher wellbeing; however, little research addresses the critiques and sustainability of PPIs. This study investigated teacher experiences of PPIs and the impact on their wellbeing in professional and personal contexts. Qualitative data were collected using multi-methods in a primary school in two settings: staff-meetings with 21 teachers and a self-interest group with 9 teachers. Results showed practising PPIs enhanced teachers' wellbeing multidimensionally and produced positive impacts on others. The challenges experienced and plans for sustainable actions were identified. Insights into sustainable teacher wellbeing programmes and professional development are offered.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Learning ‘in the hive’: social character and student wellbeing in the age of psychometric data.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14232/","Bates, A","August 2021","Growing societal concern about a crisis in the wellbeing of young people has prompted a range of responses from governments and corporations, predicated on an ideal of the resilient, self-reliant individual. Behavioural economists, data scientists and educational technology companies now offer a variety of psychological interventions based on psychometric data, aimed at ‘equipping’ individual students with the necessary skills and character to enable them to withstand the pressures of contemporary life. As a consequence, the critical importance of mutually supportive interpersonal relationships continues to be neglected in mainstream approaches to Social and Emotional Learning (SEL). This article draws on Fromm’s theory of social character and Zuboff’s analysis of ‘life in the hive’ to challenge the assumptions about human behaviour underpinning data science and its application in digital tools for social and emotional learning and self-managed wellbeing. To improve students’ wellbeing, we need to begin with an understanding of why they are more likely to thrive within a network of mutually supportive social relationships than a digital ‘hive’.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Disabled people’s experiences of the Coronavirus pandemic: a call to action for social change.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14970/","Read, S; Parfitt, A; Bush, T; Simmons, B; Levinson, M.P","September 2022","The Coronavirus pandemic has caused significant disruption and change in most aspects of society, and there are concerns that disabled people may be particularly disadvantaged. This article, written by disabled activists and non‐disabled allies, shares data extrapolated from focus groups regarding the lived experiences of twelve disabled people and disability allies during the Covid‐19 pandemic, eleven of whom were based in the UK, and one based in Iraq. We describe the key issues and learning points from this data, arguing that the measures taken by the government and organisations to protect the public during the pandemic have instead brought to the fore long‐standing ableist narratives regarding which bodies are valuable in society. This ableist agenda has acted to control and silence the voices of disabled people by objectifying disability and defining “pre‐existing health conditions” as being more expendable, and therefore less worthy of attention during the pandemic. In presenting our position for change and call to action, we will argue that it is only when disabled people’s experiences and voices are heard in decision‐making that policymakers can begin to learn from the inequalities that have been demonstrated through the pandemic. Here, we will introduce our Wellcome Trust‐funded “We Are the People” Disability Research Collective programme (2021–2026). This programme develops a new disability activist‐led research network, whereby disabled people can conduct research into topics that are important to them.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Maker-centricity and ‘edge-places of creativity’: CARE-full making in a CARE-less world.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15346/","Hackney, F; Onions, L; Rogers, G; Figueiredo, D; Loveday, M","May 2023","Susan Luckman, citing Katherine Gibson’s call for a return to ‘the grass-roots work of engaging the community and being open to developing new economies’, advocates a vision of creative industries that builds the affordances of ‘edge-places of creativity’. Luckman’s focus is non-urban localities. Her proposal, nevertheless, could equally apply to the amateur craft groups, community organisations and independent businesspeople that the Arts and Humanities Research Council–funded projects Co-Producing CARE: Community Asset-based Research and Enterprise, and Maker-Centric: Building Place-based, Co-making Communities worked with in deprived inner-city areas in the British Midlands. Both projects were undertaken with Craftspace and other stakeholder organisations, worked collaboratively with community groups, employed co-production processes and combined hand-making with digital fabrication. The aim of each project was to prototype a method with communities that builds agencies (cultural, social, economic, skills-based) through making and could be applied by other groups. While the CARE method was concerned with the affordances of collaborative making, Maker-Centric looked at these through a heritage and placed-based lens. This article examines the potential for local, collaborative, purposeful, social making as an ‘edge-place’ activity for creative enterprise that is inclusive and supportive.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Building constituencies for flood risk management: critical insights from a flood defences dispute in Ireland.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14604/","Jeffers, J.M","February 2022","Stakeholder consultation and participation are often viewed as an essential component of hazards governance and disaster risk reduction. However, an extensive literature in the fields of hazards management, disaster risk reduction, planning, and environmental governance has highlighted numerous challenges that have constrained attempts to increase participation in decision-making. Some scholars have called for transformative alternative approaches based on engaging broader constituencies of interest or on refocusing decision-making from knowledge transfer to relationship building. This paper contrasts consultative and constituency building models of hazards governance through an examination of a disputed flood relief scheme in Cork, Ireland. Despite extensive stakeholder consultation, the proposed Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme has been the subject of an ongoing dispute between local groups supporting and opposing its implementation. This dispute has prompted a range of interested parties to become involved in debating flood risk management options for Cork City. This has increased both the number of people engaging with issues related to flood risk management and the basis on which they have done so. The ways in which these wider constituencies of interest have emerged highlight important challenges and opportunities for flood risk management, as well as for hazards governance more generally.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Using techniques of neutralisation to maintain contact; the experiences of loved ones supporting remand prisoners.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14672/","Masson, I; Booth, N","August 2022","This article proposes that loved ones supporting prisoners with experience of remand in England and Wales may use Sykes & Matza's (1957) ‘techniques of neutralization’ by proxy. Adopting neutralisations may enable those in prison to be viewed not as those who have harmed, or bad people, but as those who themselves have been harmed. Potential benefits of these techniques are twofold: they help to reject stigma; and explain and enable continued contact. This framework may be a useful basis for work exploring familial contact and support for those affected by imprisonment.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Do we enjoy what we sense and perceive? A dissociation between aesthetic appreciation and basic perception of environmental objects or events.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14807/","Karim, A.K.M.R; Proulx, M.J; de Sousa, A.A ; Likova, L.T","June 2022","This integrative review rearticulates the notion of human aesthetics by critically appraising the conventional definitions, offerring a new, more comprehensive definition, and identifying the fundamental components associated with it. It intends to advance holistic understanding of the notion by differentiating aesthetic perception from basic perceptual recognition, and by characterizing these concepts from the perspective of information processing in both visual and nonvisual modalities. To this end, we analyze the dissociative nature of information processing in the brain, introducing a novel local-global integrative model that differentiates aesthetic processing from basic perceptual processing. This model builds on the current state of the art in visual aesthetics as well as newer propositions about nonvisual aesthetics. This model comprises two analytic channels: aesthetics-only channel and perception-to-aesthetics channel. The aesthetics-only channel primarily involves restricted local processing for quality or richness (e.g., attractiveness, beauty/prettiness, elegance, sublimeness, catchiness, hedonic value) analysis, whereas the perception-to-aesthetics channel involves global/extended local processing for basic feature analysis, followed by restricted local processing for quality or richness analysis. We contend that aesthetic processing operates independently of basic perceptual processing, but not independently of cognitive processing. We further conjecture that there might be a common faculty, labeled as aesthetic cognition faculty, in the human brain for all sensory aesthetics albeit other parts of the brain can also be activated because of basic sensory processing prior to aesthetic processing, particularly during the operation of the second channel. This generalized model can account not only for simple and pure aesthetic experiences but for partial and complex aesthetic experiences as well.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Down a rabbit hole: burrowing behaviour and larger home ranges are related to larger brains in leporids.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14964/","Todorov, O.S; Hird, C; Kraatz, B; Sherratt, E; Hill, N; de Sousa, A.A ; Blomberg, S; Weisbecker, V","September 2022","Studies on the evolution of brain size variation usually focus on large clades encompassing broad phylogenetic groups. This risks introducing ‘noise’ in the results, often obscuring effects that might be detected in less inclusive clades. Here, we focus on a sample of endocranial volumes (endocasts) of 18 species of rabbits and hares (Lagomorpha: Leporidae), which are a discrete radiation of mammals with a suitably large range of body sizes. Using 60 individuals, we test five popular hypotheses on brain size and olfactory bulb evolution in mammals. We also address the pervasive issue of missing data, using multiple phylogenetic imputations as to conserve the full sample size for all analyses. Our analyses show that home range and burrowing behaviour are the only predictors of leporid brain size variation. Litter size, which is one of the most widely reported constraints on brain size, was unexpectedly not associated with brain size. However, a constraining effect may be masked by a strong association of litter size with temperature seasonality, warranting further study. Lastly, we show that unreasonable estimations of phylogenetic signal (Pagel’s lamba) warrant additional caution when using small sample sizes, such as ours, in comparative studies.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Electric vehicles adoption behaviour: synthesising the technology readiness index with environmentalism values and instrumental attributes.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14913/","Salari, N","August 2022","Since the introduction of Electric Vehicles (EVs) into the consumer market, the most important question has been how to persuade people to adopt this product. This is a very challenging mission for the industry and governments due to the nature of the product. It is a revolutionary innovation which means that it imposes major shifts in driving behaviour. The adoption rate however is slowly growing worldwide. Previous studies have shed light on the mechanism in which consumers express willingness to purchase EVs, mainly from the perspective of instrumental attributes (the perceived functional aspects of EVs) and the environmentalism values. This paper includes some behavioural traits to previous prediction models as plausible drivers to purchase EVs: Technology Readiness Index (TRI), and Desire for Unique Consumer Products (DUCP). These traits were synthesised with the aforementioned instrumental attributes and environmentalism values to offer a broad perspective on what drives the purchase intention of EVs.  This study was conducted in the UK through intercept survey, with a sample size of 336 individuals. The results suggest that TRI, manifested through innovativeness and insecurity towards technology, is a significant driver of EV purchase intention. In addition, three instrumental factors, namely driving range, convenience, and fuel costs, were found as significant predictors. Unlike previous studies that suggest EVs should be targeted towards environmentalist consumers, this study found weaker support for this claim. DUCP was also not found to be a significant factor, contrary to previous findings. The term EV in this article refers to battery-powered electric vehicle (BEV), which are fully electric vehicles with chargeable batteries.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Tomboys, Annedroids and the new normal.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14862/","Feasey, R; Dymond, E.J; Harrison, J; Wells, H","July 2022","A myriad of children’s animations include a tomboy in their otherwise predictable character biographies, be it Mulan (Mulan 1998), Edith (Despicable Me 2010), Merida (Brave 2012), or Wyldstyle (The Lego Movie 2014) on the big screen; or Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls 1998–2005, 2016–2019), Dora (Dora the Explorer 2000–2015) or Rainbow Dash (My Little Pony: Friendship in Magic 2010–2020) in contemporary popular programming. However, these girls tend to be singled out for their sartorial efforts, mannerisms, and interests as they negotiate traditional codes of femininity and push the boundaries of acceptable girlhood to include strength and rebellion over and above coquettishness, pastel palettes, and subversive niceness. What these animated girls, be they anthropomorphic or otherwise, have in common, is that they stand out as exceptional . . . they are the tomboy amidst an otherwise predictable backdrop of gendered clothing, traits, and mannerisms. And although it is routinely animation that can push the boundaries of appropriate sex, gender, family, and social codes, this chapter will suggest that it is children’s live-action programming that presents the most progressive take on the contemporary tomboy. Building on its animated predecessors, the live-action Amazon original, Annedroids (2014–2017) presents the tomboy as a routine, accepted, and, indeed, ordinary iteration of girlhood. Eleven-year-old Anne/Addison Holley is the central protagonist, and, based on appearance (dungarees and unkempt hair), interests (science, engineering, and making mechanical companions) and bedroom culture (robots alongside florals), she is presented as the show’s tomboy lead. Anne is a very smart girl in a junkyard world, taking a seat amidst a growing friendship group that carefully introduces the program’s young audience to different ways of performing gender, removed from judgment or hierarchy.   Annedroids presents the tomboy, not as the exception that proves the more predictable feminine rule, but as a mainstream depiction of contemporary girlhood. The characters, be they girls, boys, men, women, or robotic creations, play with science, gender, and sartorial choices. Annedroids has perhaps unsurprisingly won the Parents Choice Gold Award and received eleven daytime Emmy nominations. After all, the program presents a variety of warm and welcoming family units, gives valuable screen time to a diverse multi-generational cast, and brings STEM subjects into popular children’s entertainment. Such diversity provides the backdrop to the show’s mainstream tomboy. The Annedroids tomboy is rarely singled out or asked to justify her gendered self, and as such, the program can be seen to be presenting its whip-smart and tech-savvy tomboy as just another way of experiencing girlhood: as the new normal.","Tech","Bath Spa University"

"Knowledge priorities on climate change and water in the Upper Indus Basin: a horizon scanning exercise to identify the top 100 research questions in social and natural sciences.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14715/","Orr, A","April 2022","River systems originating from the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) are dominated by runoff from snow and glacier melt and summer monsoonal rainfall. These water resources are highly stressed as huge populations of people living in this region depend on them, including for agriculture, domestic use, and energy production. Projections suggest that the UIB region will be affected by considerable (yet poorly quantified) changes to the seasonality and composition of runoff in the future, which are likely to have considerable impacts on these supplies. Given how directly and indirectly communities and ecosystems are dependent on these resources and the growing pressure on them due to ever-increasing demands, the impacts of climate change pose considerable adaptation challenges. The strong linkages between hydroclimate, cryosphere, water resources, and human activities within the UIB suggest that a multi- and inter-disciplinary research approach integrating the social and natural/environmental sciences is critical for successful adaptation to ongoing and future hydrological and climate change. Here we use a horizon scanning technique to identify the Top 100 questions related to the most pressing knowledge gaps and research priorities in social and natural sciences on climate change and water in the UIB. These questions are on the margins of current thinking and investigation and are clustered into 14 themes, covering three overarching topics of ‘governance, policy, and sustainable solutions’, ‘socioeconomic processes and livelihoods’, and ‘integrated Earth System processes’. Raising awareness of these cutting-edge knowledge gaps and opportunities will hopefully encourage researchers, funding bodies, practitioners, and policy makers to address them.","Tech","Bath Spa University"

To make the task tractable, here we consider a specific example of short-term tactical decisions under uncertainty made by the military at sea. Through this lens, we sketch out relevant literature from three psychological tasks each underpinned by decision-making processes: categorisation, communication and choice. From the literature, we note two general cognitive tendencies that emerge across all three stages: the effect of cognitive load and individual differences. Drawing on these tendencies, we recommend strategies, tools and future research that could improve performance in military domains – but, by extension, would also generalise to other high-stakes contexts. In so doing, we show the extent to which domain general properties of high order cognition are sufficient in explaining behaviours in domain specific contexts.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Is the blue wall of silence a fallacy in cases of police sexual misconduct?","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15647/","Sweeting, F; Cole, T; Hills, P.J","August 2023","Police sexual misconduct encompasses a range of behaviours: from sexually inappropriate language directed towards colleagues or members of the public to engaging in sexual relationships with vulnerable members of the public. All types of police misconduct are thought to be under-reported, in part because of the ‘blue wall of silence’ where police officers fail to report colleagues’ wrongdoing for reasons of loyalty and a fear of retribution. A sample of 382 English police officers were invited to assess eight fictional police sexual misconduct scenarios to ascertain whether the scenario was a breach of the Code of Ethics, the expected level of discipline and if they would report the officer. Reporting likelihood was increased when officers perceived the scenario to be a breach of the Code of Ethics and worthy of a higher level of discipline. Female officers were more likely to report sexual misconduct than male officers, and scenarios involving direct colleagues were less likely to be reported. Non-reporting was greatest for sexual harassment between colleagues and the seriousness of this behaviour was minimised as justification for non-reporting. Use of confidential reporting was minimal with direct reporting to a line manager to be the preferred option.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Anime in the UK: the history, cultural context, and evolution of UK anime fandom.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14677/","Holmes, L.M","March 2022","Organised anime fandom in the UK is relatively young, having originated in the early ’90s following the UK’s first recorded anime screening programme at a convention (McCarthy, 2018a) and, shortly thereafter, the success of Ōtomo Katsuhiro’s Akira (1988) and the launch of Manga Video. However, while it is tempting to take this as the absolute genesis of UK anime fandom, to do so is to decontextualise both anime and anime fandom in the UK – neither occurred in isolation, nor did either spring up overnight. In this thesis I examine the history and dynamics of anime fans and fandom in the UK, but rather than beginning with this obvious starting point, I work through the pre-history of fandom, identifying the localised, “culturally odourless” (Iwabuchi, 1998) titles screened on television or in the cinema that served to catch the attention of young people who would become fans. But more than that, I seek to contextualise anime fandom – and the ways in which the medium of anime was perceived by the British press and public – in terms of Anglo-Japanese diplomacy and the ways that the British have historically responded to Japanese art and culture since the late nineteenth century. I also explore the main sites of change in anime fandom – the Video Nasties panic of the ’90s, the mass popularity of Pokémon (1997-Present), the Academy Awards success of Spirited Away (2001), and the rise of the Internet – and, inspired by Azuma Hiroki (2001), I survey current UK anime fans to identify where generational lines can be drawn, how these generations differ, and what they have in common. Finally, I suggest possibilities for extended and intersectional study of UK anime fans and speculate about what the future may hold for anime fandom… and whether anime has succeeded in truly achieving mainstream status.","Tech","Bath Spa University"

The thesis identifies HoIIV’s National Focus Trees (NFTs), diagrams that document the progression of history, as ‘engines of causality’ which simultaneously conceive of a recognisable past and function to statistically support the player. The thesis examines how territorial expansion, economic and industrial development, and political ideology are disseminated to the player through the NFTs of the German Reich, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom. The thesis illustrates how HoIIV’s curated expressions of history present the Second World War as an inevitable conflict. Through systemic and textual abstraction, the NFTs amplify political events, but overlook cultural and social phenomena. The thesis creates a framework for exploring the NFTs through external paratexts, utilising the HOI4 Wiki online encyclopedia as a dominant source base. HOI4 Wiki openly disseminates all computational and textual information associated to the NFTs. By consulting an external object of digital game culture, the thesis examines how the history of the late-1930s is curated by the NFTs and presents an innovative approach for understanding how both game system and text reinterpret history. In this methodology, the thesis demonstrates that historical game studies scholarship can be conducted without direct access to a digital game. Ultimately, the thesis determines that HoIIV’s NFTs present a fractious epoch where totalitarian regimes are more effective in waging war than democratic states. The NFTs characterise democracies as burdened by bureaucracy, while totalitarian nations are regimes of political, military, and industrial dynamism. Through these curated expressions of history, the developer-curators portray the mid-to-late 1930s as a linear passage towards an inevitable global conflict.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"What’s in the box? Exploring UK players’ experiences of loot boxes in games; the conceptualisation and parallels with gambling.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15672/","Hodge, S.E ; Vykoukal, M; McAlaney, J; Bush-Evans, R.D; Wang, R; Ali, R","August 2023","Loot boxes are a popular mechanic within many video games, but it remains unclear if some forms of loot boxes can be seen of as gambling. However, the perspectives of players are often neglected, such as whether they see them as ‘fair’ game elements and how closely they feel this aligns with gambling. In this paper, we synthesise a conceptualisation for loot boxes through players’ actual experience and explore if there are any parallels with gam- bling. Twenty-one participants who played video games took part in the research through either an interview or online survey. Thematic analysis suggested that six themes were core to exploring loot boxes: Random Chance Effects, Attitudes Towards Content, Implementa- tion, Parallels with Gambling, Game Design, and The Player. The results suggested both indirect and direct parallels with gambling from the players experiences. Implications of game design and classifying loot boxes as gambling are discussed in relation to game design and risk factors of gambling and purchasing behaviour.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"An exploration of the underlying generative mechanisms that shape university students agency in their educational digital practices.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14650/","Kuhn, H.C","February 2022","Research in educational technology is often approached from an enthusiastic stance that emphasises questions related to 'what works', 'best practice', and 'efficiency', leaving the messy and nuanced lived digital culture and experiences of young people relatively unexplored. This study explores this gap, challenging deterministic therefore, reductive ideas such as young people being 'digital natives' and tools being naturally powerful drivers for change. The aim is to understand why and how undergraduates in Education Studies engage with digital tools and platforms? Rather than just accumulating facts and experiences about observable facts, emphasis is given not only to students' meaning making and decision-making concerning digital engagements with tools and platforms but also to explanations of the deeper levels of social reality. The overarching goal of the study is thus, to seek knowledge through scrutinising the level of the real where the generative mechanisms are found. The study was conducted at one small, post 92 university in the UK with 22 undergraduates attending the Education Studies course. For this empirical study, mapping was used as a means to inquire into students' daily entanglements with digital technology under a qualitative and critical approach. Whilst the philosophical anchor is critical realism, theoretical guidance is provided by Realist Social Theory. Under this framework, an explanation of the hidden and invisible generative mechanisms that shape students' reflexive engagement -their agency with digital technology was given. Through this viewpoint, the use of educational technology was addressed not from an individual perspective but in relation to the social structures in which students operate. The results of the study show how the institutional digital space is a space of struggle for many making it a structural barrier for students' agency. Emotions, one of the generative mechanisms at play, has a significant influence in shaping students' lack of engagement with open digital practices. It was also found that digital capability defined as a generative mechanism entails internal and external aspects such as the social position that students occupy in relation to others and technology, and the concomitant vested interest of students proves to have a strong impact in the digital practices that students engage with. Moreover, it was elicited that how the institutional culture operates has a powerful influence on students' reflexive engagement with open and participatory tools. In this study, three aspects of the institutional culture were addressed, the belief that students are digital natives, the assessment that prevails in the School of Education and the centrality of the VLE as the main digital technology used to manage learning and teaching. Through bringing these findings to light, I make an empirically grounded contribution to the ongoing theoretical debates about structure and agency in students' open educational practices.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Marketing virtual reality experiences… without the headset:
watching, playing and fearing Anagram’s Goliath.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14286/","Freeman, M","September 2021","If the immersive sector is to capture new audiences from different corners of the cultural landscape, then gateway promotional content is needed – that is, marketing that engages those new to immersive technologies. Is it possible, however, to promote the unique pleasures that Virtual Reality (VR) offers without putting people in headsets? Exploring this question, this article outlines research that experiments with new ways of marketing VR experiences based on applying theoretical concepts to a marketing campaign for Goliath, a 2021 VR documentary produced by Anagram. The campaign tested out Baekdal’s characterisation of two ‘moments’ of a VR experience: (1) a ‘macro moment’, which is experiencing VR yourself in a headset; and (2) a ‘micro moment’, which is presenting VR to people without a headset and whom prefer watching others in a VR environment rather participating in it themselves. This article argues that audiences new to VR are more likely to be engaged by promotion for VR if it presents a ‘micro moment’ of VR based on watching other people. We outline ways that the immersive sector can produce marketing for VR that better communicates not just what a VR experience is, but also what its audiences are expected to do.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Pond ecology and conservation: research priorities and knowledge gaps.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14227/","Hill, M.J","August 2021","Ponds are among the most biodiverse and ecologically important freshwater habitats globally and may provide a significant opportunity to mitigate anthropogenic pressures and reverse the decline of aquatic biodiversity. Ponds also provide important contributions to society through the provision of ecosystem services. Despite the ecological and societal importance of ponds, freshwater research, policy, and conservation have historically focused on larger water bodies, with significant gaps remaining in our understanding and conservation of pond ecosystems. In May 2019, pond researchers and practitioners participated in a workshop to tackle several pond ecology, conservation, and management issues. Nine research themes and 30 research questions were identified during and following the workshop to address knowledge gaps around: (1) pond habitat definition; (2) global and long-term data availability; (3) anthropogenic stressors; (4) aquatic–terrestrial interactions; (5) succession and disturbance; (6) freshwater connectivity; (7) pond monitoring and technological advances; (8) socio-economic factors; and (9) conservation, management, and policy. Key areas for the future inclusion of ponds in environmental and conservation policy were also discussed. Addressing gaps in our fundamental understanding of pond ecosystems will facilitate more effective research-led conservation and management of pondscapes, their inclusion in environmental policy, support the sustainability of ecosystem services, and help address many of the global threats driving the decline in freshwater biodiversity.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Online opera: an applied collision of opera and web creativity.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14406/","Scott, L.T.D","November 2021","This practice-based research explores the collision of opera and web creativity through the development and evaluation of a new 'online opera' called ""The Village"" (2015). Contrasting existing offerings that position the web as a means of disseminating more familiar representations of opera, ""The Village"" draws on concepts of participatory culture, digital storytelling and co-creativity to advance a culturally novel apprehension of online opera that treats the web as a unique creative space. This interpretation is intrinsically digital, unable to be realised through conventional forms of theatrical presentation, and transformative in its approach to the core elements of opera. ""The Village"" in additional serves as a vehicle to investigate how the phenomenon of 'liveness' - that is, a feeling of 'now-ness' experienced in live performance - may be reimagined in the context of an entirely mediated opera. A range of theoretical perspectives are drawn on to establish a set of liveness devices that attempt to evoke in visitors to ""The Village"" a sense of contemporaneity and shared experience. These include temporal alignment between virtual and real-world events and the facilitation of social interaction through a narrative mechanism called the 'Digital Chorus', amongst others. Evaluative activities critique the effectiveness of such devices, and offer means in which they may be modified to better construct 'the live'.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Project knole: an autocosmic approach to authoring resonant computational characters.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14392/","Sherman, R.P","November 2021","Project knole, consisting of this thesis and a mixed reality installation artwork centred around a computational simulation, is a practice-based response to the question of how a character in a work of computational narrative art might maintain their defining quality of dynamic agency within a system (arguably one of the key potentials of the form), while achieving the ‘resonant’ qualities of characters in more materially-static artforms. In all aspects of this project, I explore a new design philosophy for achieving this balance; between the authorship of a procedural computational system, and the ability of that system to ‘resonate’ with the imagination of an audience. This philosophy, which I term the ‘autocosmic’, seeks inspiration for the curation of audience response outside the obvious boundaries of artistic discipline, across the wider spectrum of human imaginative engagement; examples often drawn from mostly non-aesthetic domains. As well as defining the terms ‘resonance’ and ‘autocosmic’, and delineating my methodology more generally, this thesis demonstrates how the ‘autocosmic’ was employed within my creative work. In particular, it shows how some of the perennial problems of computational character development might be mediated by exploring other non-aesthetic examples of imaginative, narrative engagement with personified systems. In the context of this project, such examples come from the historio-cultural relationship between human beings and the environments they inhabit, outside of formal artistic practice. From this ‘autocosmic’ launchpad, I have developed an artwork that starts to explore how this rich cultural and biological lineage of human social engagement with systemic place can be applied fruitfully to the development of a ‘resonant’ computational character.","Tech","Bath Spa University"

"The production of social spaces for children with profound and multiple learning difficulties: a Lefebvrian analysis.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13984/","Simmons, B","April 2021","There is on-going debate about whether mainstream education is desirable for children with profound and multiple learning difficulties (PMLD). Whilst some hold that ‘inclusion’ is a human right, and that interaction with mainstream peers leads to socio-cognitive gains, others argue that profoundly disabled learners require developmental curricular provided by special schools. Despite such claims, there is little evidence to support either view. This paper contributes to the debate by presenting research that examined how mainstream schools and special schools, across nursery, primary, and secondary settings, provided alternative social spaces for children with PMLD. It applies a Lefebvrian lens to illuminate how social engagement depended on the extent to which prescribed practices (‘abstract spaces’) dominated the interaction (‘spatial practices’), and the conditions which allowed novel forms of engagement to emerge (‘lived spaces’). Novel forms of engagement correlated with positive social development. The conclusion challenges the ‘mainstream-special’ binary presupposed in inclusion debates.","Tech","Bath Spa University"
"Seen/believed: a practice-based study of depiction
within the photograph.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14377/","Mahon, M","October 2021","This practice-based study with accompanying body of work, addresses the question of how recognition and illusion, as well as viewers’ expectations, influence the reading of a photograph. It arose from Barthes’ comment about the ‘real unreality’ of the photograph, interpreted as expressing the conundrum that while the contemporary photograph may be an object or on screen, what it illustrates is not wholly accurate to what was once in front of the lens. (Barthes, 1977, p. 44). The study is explained in this document, outlining the trajectory and rationale behind the research, it describes all the studio work and notes contextual links to related works by other artists. The studio work, particularly those pieces presented at exhibition, are at the heart of the project. They are the visual enactment, the resolution and the new knowledge integral to the enquiry. The study investigated the question of what is seen/believed within the contemporary photograph, used within art practice, accepting that this may be on screen or paper. The topic was subdivided into an enquiry of the assumptions surrounding the accuracy of a photograph, the implications of staging within the photograph and the phenomenology of the paper photograph. Throughout there was an emphasis on first-hand research and critical reflection, annotated in sketch books. Relevant theoretical texts, which became interrelated objects of thinking, were by Roland Barthes, Lucy Soutter and David Campany, amongst others.  Initially the studio practice engaged with given strategies and tactics used by established 20th / 21st century practitioners, notably James Casebere and Thomas Demand because of their use of models specifically made to photograph. Early works made during the study were ‘in the style of..’, progressing to works using deliberate staging, resulting in finished pieces with photographs and objects. The study also includes extended experimentation with early process photography, notably cyanotypes, to extend ideas of phenomenology.  The studio work, in particular ""The Mugshots"" (2018), as well as first-hand research, demonstrated that contemporaneously the notion of what might constitute a photograph has been embellished and eroded. The author discusses the personal credibility of the photograph as object, suggesting that this lingers from the analogue, endowing a form of tacit knowledge. The study observes that definitions of the photograph are no longer adequate. Perhaps 'photographic' as an adjective is preferable to 'photograph' as a noun. Therefore, as well as questioning the actual compared to what is presented within a photograph, the study became concerned with finding a more appropriate definition of what constitutes a photograph. The author concludes that a photograph exists on paper or a screen and is made by the reaction of light emitted from an object, onto chemicals or a processor. The insistence on ‘light emitted from an object’ makes it different to an image, which may appear to be a photograph. The concluding work in the study ""Follow Me Lights"" (2020) holds the findings and excitement of the whole study as well as the physical enactment of the new knowledge. By examining the camera’s response to the phenomenon of light, and the happenstance of a fault in the camera’s processor, it shows a smudge (analogue) beside visible pixels (digital). The work disrupts all ideas of true/real/ accurate because of the introduction of contradiction and uncertainty. The conclusion is that the viewer reads what is presented dependant on context and their own expectation. The study has come full circle and the photograph remains enigmatic, echoing Barthes.","Tech","Bath Spa University"

"Determinants of financial literacy and behavioural biases of young adults: the comparison of Bristol, UK and Istanbul.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14342/","Akin, I","October 2021","Financial literacy is defined as the combination of financial knowledge, financial behaviour and financial attitude and the ability to use this combination in financial decisions (OECD, 2015). A high level of financial well-being depends on individuals financial literacy level because a high financial literacy level increases the possibility of taking good financial decisions (Lusardi, 2010). However, financial literacy is not the only factor that affects taking accurate financial decisions; at the same time, behavioural biases should be considered. Behavioural biases are systematic errors that keep individuals away from rationality (Shefrin, 2002). The biases might cause unhelpful or even hurtful decisions. Therefore, a high level of behavioural biases negatively affects the financial well-being of individuals (Montier, 2007).  In this research, the relationship between financial literacy and behavioural biases among young adults in Bristol, UK and Istanbul, Turkey was examined. A young adult can be defined as an individual within the age range of late teens or early twenties to thirties (Smith, 2018; OECD, 2019). The main aim of the research is to identify whether young adults can be prevented from behavioural biases by increasing their financial literacy. This research contributes to the literature by investigating the relationship between financial literacy and behavioural biases of young adults because this relationship has not been investigated adequately and also different target group have been examined in the literature.  In the literature different components have been used in order to measure financial literacy. This research contributes to the literature by identifying the most important components of financial literacy.  As a result of the investigation financial knowledge appears to be the most important factor. It also highlights the importance of the application of financial knowledge as another contribution. The critical point is that young adults may not improve their financial well-being unless financial knowledge is used in practices. Another contribution of this research is to reveal the most common behavioural biases among young adults in Bristol, UK and Istanbul. These biases among young adults in Bristol, UK, are over-optimism, anchoring, categorisation, conservatism while framing, cognitive dissonance, the illusion of knowledge, and cue competition in Istanbul. The relationship between financial literacy and behavioural biases was investigated via Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and ANOVA analysis. The result of the research reveals that there is a positive relationship between financial literacy and behavioural biases. Therefore, a high level of financial literacy does not reduce behavioural biases.","Tech","Bath Spa University"

These data, alongside experimental and comparative evidence, are needed to resolve questions about brain energetics, cognitive specializations, and developmental plasticity. Through the application of interdisciplinary techniques to the fossil record, paleoneurology has been leading major innovations. Neuroimaging is shedding light on fossil brain organization and behaviors. Inferences about the development and physiology of the brains of extinct species can be experimentally investigated through brain organoids and transgenic models based on ancient DNA. Phylogenetic comparative methods integrate data across species and associate genotypes to phenotypes, and brains to behaviors. Meanwhile, fossil and archeological discoveries continuously contribute new knowledge. Through cooperation, the scientific community can accelerate knowledge acquisition. Sharing digitized museum collections improves the availability of rare fossils and artifacts. Comparative neuroanatomical data are available through online databases, along with tools for their measurement and analysis. In the context of these advances, the paleoneurological record provides ample opportunity for future research. The biomedical and ecological sciences can benefit from paleoneurology's profound approach to understanding the mind as well as its novel research pipelines that correlate neuroanatomy to genes and behavior.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"The desert burns clean: the challenge of conveying accurate science through embodied characters in science fiction.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15367/","Kirby, B.K","June 2023","This thesis is comprised of two parts: a novel, The Desert Burns Clean, and a contextualizing exegesis. Together, these two elements allow me to explore the challenge of accurately portraying the facts of a complex scientific reality while still accessing the truth of the human body experience. To achieve this, I utilize a variety of technical craft strategies in my fiction, while examining and reflecting upon them in my contextualizing exegesis in ways that I hope will be of use to other writers and critics. Based on current scientific research, the novel is set in a future where optimal health—complete with long life—is available for those who can afford it through regular microbial inoculations begun at birth. In this fictional world, fertility rates have dropped, and epidemics have become common. Against this backdrop, I have created five protagonists who are diverse in terms of their genders as well as their cultural, educational, and racial backgrounds. They must work towards trusting each other to overcome the machinations of a wealthy and politically powerful owner of a fertility clinic who wants to exploit their bodies for her illicit research. The contextual component of my thesis examines the strategies I use to incorporate accurate scientific information in the novel through the embodied experiences of my characters. My first strategy is that of worldbuilding. Here, the scientific information is not overtly present in the text but provides the “natural laws” of the world and how the characters will experience it. With worldbuilding, an accurate foundation of current science is laid from which all other aspects of story will be grounded. Secondly, I explore four forms of exposition through which I relate scientific information overtly through my characters. Finally, I discuss the benefits, challenges, and limitations of conveying information through characters’ body experiences. We cannot escape the fact that information is processed in and through our bodies. Thus, fundamental to my argument and methodology is the premise that grounding information and knowledge in human body experience offers writers an important strategy for conveying complex scientific information accurately in a work of science fiction.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

At the base of the sequence, a series of gravel and sand facies were deposited, initially as part of a meandering river. Reductions in flow energy of the latter and avulsion led to the development of short-lived channels and episodic backwater environments, the deposits of which are recorded as Facies Associations 1–3. Poorly sorted, probably colluvial deposits formed beyond the limit of the channel (Facies Association 4). Mollusca, Coleoptera, plant macrofossils, pollen and vertebrates recovered from the channel facies indicate broadly similar climatic conditions throughout accretion. Temperature ranges derived from mutual climatic range analysis of the Coleoptera almost completely overlap with those of Cerney Wick at the present day, albeit that winters may have been cooler when the channel was active. Further, the floral and faunal data suggest that the meandering river flowed through an open grassland environment, the latter heavily grazed by large vertebrates, most notably mammoth. Most of the botanical and faunal remains, together with four optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age estimates ranging from 225 ± 23 to 187 ± 19 ka, suggest correlation of the channel deposits with MIS 7. The basal deposits (Facies Association 1) yielded the majority of vertebrate remains and all the lithic artefacts, most of which seem likely to have travelled only a short distance. Although only a few artefacts were recovered, they add to the relatively limited evidence of human activity from the upper Thames. The channel deposits are overlain by sheet gravels (Facies Association 5) which are attributed to the Northmoor Member of the Upper Thames Formation. These were likely to have been deposited as bedload in a braided stream environment, while two OSL age estimates of 129 ± 14 and 112 ± 11 ka suggest accumulation during MIS 5.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"The evolution of primate short-term memory.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15280/","ManyPrimates, ","March 2023","Short-term memory is implicated in a range of cognitive abilities and is critical for understanding primate cognitive evolution. To investigate the effects of phylogeny, ecology and sociality on short-term memory, we tested the largest and most diverse primate sample to date (421 non-human primates across 41 species) in an experimental delayed-response task. Our results confirm previous findings that longer delays decrease memory performance across species and taxa. Our analyses demonstrate a considerable contribution of phylogeny over ecological and social factors on the distribution of short-term memory performance in primates; closely related species had more similar short-term memory abilities. Overall, individuals in the branch of Hominoidea performed better compared to Cercopithecoidea, who in turn performed above Platyrrhini and Strepsirrhini. Interdependencies between phylogeny and socioecology of a given species presented an obstacle to disentangling the effects of each of these factors on the evolution of shortterm memory capacity. However, this study offers an important step forward in understanding the interspecies and individual variation in short-term memory ability by providing the first phylogenetic reconstruction of this trait’s evolutionary history. The dataset constitutes a unique resource for studying the evolution of primate cognition and the role of short-term memory in other cognitive abilities.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

From the literature, we note two general cognitive tendencies that emerge across all three stages: the effect of cognitive load and individual differences. Drawing on these tendencies, we recommend strategies, tools and future research that could improve performance in military domains – but, by extension, would also generalise to other high-stakes contexts. In so doing, we show the extent to which domain general properties of high order cognition are sufficient in explaining behaviours in domain specific contexts.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

Victorian popular science particularly lends itself to public engagement activities through its focus on embodied learning, and this chapter describes a joint project with Ilfracombe Museum, ‘Science at the Seaside,’ which devised a public program of art, literature, science and handicraft activities that sought to engage tourists and families with the Victorian fashion for marine biology and the well-known literary and scientific figures attracted by the north Devon coast.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Anime in the UK: the history, cultural context, and evolution of UK anime fandom.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14677/","Holmes, L.M","March 2022","Organised anime fandom in the UK is relatively young, having originated in the early ’90s following the UK’s first recorded anime screening programme at a convention (McCarthy, 2018a) and, shortly thereafter, the success of Ōtomo Katsuhiro’s Akira (1988) and the launch of Manga Video. However, while it is tempting to take this as the absolute genesis of UK anime fandom, to do so is to decontextualise both anime and anime fandom in the UK – neither occurred in isolation, nor did either spring up overnight. In this thesis I examine the history and dynamics of anime fans and fandom in the UK, but rather than beginning with this obvious starting point, I work through the pre-history of fandom, identifying the localised, “culturally odourless” (Iwabuchi, 1998) titles screened on television or in the cinema that served to catch the attention of young people who would become fans. But more than that, I seek to contextualise anime fandom – and the ways in which the medium of anime was perceived by the British press and public – in terms of Anglo-Japanese diplomacy and the ways that the British have historically responded to Japanese art and culture since the late nineteenth century. I also explore the main sites of change in anime fandom – the Video Nasties panic of the ’90s, the mass popularity of Pokémon (1997-Present), the Academy Awards success of Spirited Away (2001), and the rise of the Internet – and, inspired by Azuma Hiroki (2001), I survey current UK anime fans to identify where generational lines can be drawn, how these generations differ, and what they have in common. Finally, I suggest possibilities for extended and intersectional study of UK anime fans and speculate about what the future may hold for anime fandom… and whether anime has succeeded in truly achieving mainstream status.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Developing a hydrofeminist art practice: bodies, spaces, practices.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14559/","Denning, L.R","February 2022","This research presents primary work that has been situated in the city of Plymouth (UK) – Benthic Caress (2017), Hydrosapien (2018) and Manual for Nomads (2020), supported by three bodies of exploratory work (Interim, Rhyne & Huish, Field Notes). Documentation of the work can be found here: https://aquameteor.wordpress.com/ This is a practice led PhD that seeks to make a contribution to knowledge by developing the concept of hydrofeminism, through practice. This work is practice-driven, and consciously situated within Environmental Humanities, and this thesis is foundationally and iteratively entangled with the practice. The thesis is undertaken in an interdisciplinary location of intersecting artistic practices, feminisms, posthumanism and cultural geographies, aiming to fold these entanglements into the emerging field of environmental humanities (Bird-Rose et al 2012). It is done through practice led research, thus extending hydrofeminism from its academic (text based) foundation in the work of Neimanis (2012). Water, specifically oceans, estuaries, rivers and other ‘natural’ bodies of water (including puddles) has been the material signifier across the body of work shared here, which is transdisciplinary and which has investigated hydrofeminism using a wide range of creative tools. The creative practice presented here is about water, explored through feminisms, hydrofeminism, transcorporeality, posthumanism and embodiment. Benthic Caress was a site-specific and site-responsive immersive experience that offered participants a sonic engagement with marine life using silent disco technologies. Hydrosapien was a public performance of a section of Hydrofeminism (Neimanis 2012) that pertains to ecotones, presented by a Silent Choir and two experimental voice artists. Manual for Nomads is a short film exploring community and the climate crisis that brings the languages, codes and methods of communication of differently abled persons together to create new conceptualisations of the ecotone.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

"Pond ecology and conservation: research priorities and knowledge gaps.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14227/","Hill, M.J","August 2021","Ponds are among the most biodiverse and ecologically important freshwater habitats globally and may provide a significant opportunity to mitigate anthropogenic pressures and reverse the decline of aquatic biodiversity. Ponds also provide important contributions to society through the provision of ecosystem services. Despite the ecological and societal importance of ponds, freshwater research, policy, and conservation have historically focused on larger water bodies, with significant gaps remaining in our understanding and conservation of pond ecosystems. In May 2019, pond researchers and practitioners participated in a workshop to tackle several pond ecology, conservation, and management issues. Nine research themes and 30 research questions were identified during and following the workshop to address knowledge gaps around: (1) pond habitat definition; (2) global and long-term data availability; (3) anthropogenic stressors; (4) aquatic–terrestrial interactions; (5) succession and disturbance; (6) freshwater connectivity; (7) pond monitoring and technological advances; (8) socio-economic factors; and (9) conservation, management, and policy. Key areas for the future inclusion of ponds in environmental and conservation policy were also discussed. Addressing gaps in our fundamental understanding of pond ecosystems will facilitate more effective research-led conservation and management of pondscapes, their inclusion in environmental policy, support the sustainability of ecosystem services, and help address many of the global threats driving the decline in freshwater biodiversity.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Cultural heritage and histories of the Northern Namib: historical and oral history observations for the Draft Management Plan, Skeleton Coast National Park 2021/2022-2030/2031.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14472/","Sullivan, S","January 2022","This report shares documented information for indigenous cultural heritage and histories associated with the Northern Namib, designated since 1971 as the Skeleton Coast National Park. The paper draws on two principal sources of information: 1) historical documents stretching back to the late 1800s; and 2) oral history research with now elderly people who have direct and familial memories of using and living in areas now within the Park boundary. The research shared herein affirms that localities and resources now included within the Park were used by local people in historical times, their access linked with the availability of valued foods, especially !nara (Acanthosicyos horridus) melons and marine foods such as mussels. Memories about these localities, resources and heritage concerns such as graves of family members remain alive for some individuals and their families today. These concerns retain cultural resonance in the contemporary moment, despite significant access constraints over the last several decades. Some suggestions are made for foregrounding an understanding of the Northern Namib as a remembered cultural landscape as well as an area of high conservation value, and for protecting and perhaps restoring some access to sites that may be considered of significant cultural heritage value. Such sites include graves of known ancestors and named and remembered former dwelling places. The material shared here may contribute to a diversified recognition of values for the Skeleton Coast National Park for the new Management Plan that will shape ecological and heritage conservation practice and visitor experiences over the next 10 years.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Online opera: an applied collision of opera and web creativity.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14406/","Scott, L.T.D","November 2021","This practice-based research explores the collision of opera and web creativity through the development and evaluation of a new 'online opera' called ""The Village"" (2015). Contrasting existing offerings that position the web as a means of disseminating more familiar representations of opera, ""The Village"" draws on concepts of participatory culture, digital storytelling and co-creativity to advance a culturally novel apprehension of online opera that treats the web as a unique creative space. This interpretation is intrinsically digital, unable to be realised through conventional forms of theatrical presentation, and transformative in its approach to the core elements of opera. ""The Village"" in additional serves as a vehicle to investigate how the phenomenon of 'liveness' - that is, a feeling of 'now-ness' experienced in live performance - may be reimagined in the context of an entirely mediated opera. A range of theoretical perspectives are drawn on to establish a set of liveness devices that attempt to evoke in visitors to ""The Village"" a sense of contemporaneity and shared experience. These include temporal alignment between virtual and real-world events and the facilitation of social interaction through a narrative mechanism called the 'Digital Chorus', amongst others. Evaluative activities critique the effectiveness of such devices, and offer means in which they may be modified to better construct 'the live'.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Seen/believed: a practice-based study of depiction
within the photograph.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14377/","Mahon, M","October 2021","This practice-based study with accompanying body of work, addresses the question of how recognition and illusion, as well as viewers’ expectations, influence the reading of a photograph. It arose from Barthes’ comment about the ‘real unreality’ of the photograph, interpreted as expressing the conundrum that while the contemporary photograph may be an object or on screen, what it illustrates is not wholly accurate to what was once in front of the lens. (Barthes, 1977, p. 44). The study is explained in this document, outlining the trajectory and rationale behind the research, it describes all the studio work and notes contextual links to related works by other artists. The studio work, particularly those pieces presented at exhibition, are at the heart of the project. They are the visual enactment, the resolution and the new knowledge integral to the enquiry. The study investigated the question of what is seen/believed within the contemporary photograph, used within art practice, accepting that this may be on screen or paper. The topic was subdivided into an enquiry of the assumptions surrounding the accuracy of a photograph, the implications of staging within the photograph and the phenomenology of the paper photograph. Throughout there was an emphasis on first-hand research and critical reflection, annotated in sketch books. Relevant theoretical texts, which became interrelated objects of thinking, were by Roland Barthes, Lucy Soutter and David Campany, amongst others.  Initially the studio practice engaged with given strategies and tactics used by established 20th / 21st century practitioners, notably James Casebere and Thomas Demand because of their use of models specifically made to photograph. Early works made during the study were ‘in the style of..’, progressing to works using deliberate staging, resulting in finished pieces with photographs and objects. The study also includes extended experimentation with early process photography, notably cyanotypes, to extend ideas of phenomenology.  The studio work, in particular ""The Mugshots"" (2018), as well as first-hand research, demonstrated that contemporaneously the notion of what might constitute a photograph has been embellished and eroded. The author discusses the personal credibility of the photograph as object, suggesting that this lingers from the analogue, endowing a form of tacit knowledge. The study observes that definitions of the photograph are no longer adequate. Perhaps 'photographic' as an adjective is preferable to 'photograph' as a noun. Therefore, as well as questioning the actual compared to what is presented within a photograph, the study became concerned with finding a more appropriate definition of what constitutes a photograph. The author concludes that a photograph exists on paper or a screen and is made by the reaction of light emitted from an object, onto chemicals or a processor. The insistence on ‘light emitted from an object’ makes it different to an image, which may appear to be a photograph. The concluding work in the study ""Follow Me Lights"" (2020) holds the findings and excitement of the whole study as well as the physical enactment of the new knowledge. By examining the camera’s response to the phenomenon of light, and the happenstance of a fault in the camera’s processor, it shows a smudge (analogue) beside visible pixels (digital). The work disrupts all ideas of true/real/ accurate because of the introduction of contradiction and uncertainty. The conclusion is that the viewer reads what is presented dependant on context and their own expectation. The study has come full circle and the photograph remains enigmatic, echoing Barthes.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

Attempts at improving cross-ability access to any of those are often limited in the experience they provide, or disregard multiplayer experiences. We explore ability-based asymmetric roles as a design approach to create engaging and challenging mixed-ability play. Our team designed and developed two collaborative testbed games exploring asymmetric interdependent roles. In a remote study with 13 mixed-visual-ability pairs we assessed how roles affected perceptions of engagement, competence, and autonomy, using a mixed-methods approach. The games provided an engaging and challenging experience, in which differences in visual ability were not limiting. Our results underline how experiences unequal by design can give rise to an equitable joint experience.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Particularizing adaptation to non-predominant hazards: a history of wildfires in County Donegal, Ireland from 1903 to 2019.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13929/","Jeffers, J.M","April 2021","Recent years have seen a historical turn in research on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. This has included a call for historical research that particularizes adaptation in specific locations. This paper responds to this call by using newspaper archives to construct a history of wildfires in County Donegal, Ireland. This study goes beyond existing research that particularizes adaptation, by using this history as a lens through which to evaluate current adaptation policy. In doing so it uncovers problematic mismatches between the experience of local communities living with wildfire hazards and current climate change adaptation policies. National adaptation policy in Ireland presents uncontrolled wildfires as a largely new and unfamiliar hazard that requires innovative management approaches. However, newspaper archives reveal that local communities have adopted a variety of adaptive practices for wildfire hazards for over a century, and that these practices have coevolved with shifting economic, social, political, and cultural contexts. This paper also introduces the concept of non-predominant hazards, that is hazards that are often overlooked, forgotten, or neglected. Historical research on non-predominant hazards can play an important role in making visible trajectories of adaptation for such hazards. This study also points towards how deeper particularization studies that examine the long-term usage of specific adaptation practices can also be used to test the effectiveness of these practices through time, and to offer lessons for contemporary adaptation. These results have implications for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to non-predominant hazards in a variety of contexts.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Pathways linking biodiversity to human health: a conceptual framework.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14000/","Marselle, M.R","April 2021","Biodiversity is a cornerstone of human health and well-being. However, while evidence of the contributions of nature to human health is rapidly building, research into how biodiversity relates to human health remains limited in important respects. In particular, a better mechanistic understanding of the range of pathways through which biodiversity can influence human health is needed. These pathways relate to both psychological and social processes as well as biophysical processes. Building on evidence from across the natural, social and health sciences, we present a conceptual framework organizing the pathways linking biodiversity to human health. Four domains of pathways—both beneficial as well as harmful—link biodiversity with human health: (i) reducing harm (e.g. provision of medicines, decreasing exposure to air and noise pollution); (ii) restoring capacities (e.g. attention restoration, stress reduction); (iii) building capacities (e.g. promoting physical activity, transcendent experiences); and (iv) causing harm (e.g. dangerous wildlife, zoonotic diseases, allergens). We discuss how to test components of the biodiversity-health framework with available analytical approaches and existing datasets. In a world with accelerating declines in biodiversity, profound land-use change, and an increase in non-communicable and zoonotic diseases globally, greater understanding of these pathways can reinforce biodiversity conservation as a strategy for the promotion of health for both people and nature. We conclude by identifying research avenues and recommendations for policy and practice to foster biodiversity-focused public health actions.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

We have used a new colour confocal microscope imaging method to study the 3D shape of diesel particulate matter (DPM); we observed that the particles can have sharp jagged appearing edges and consistent with these findings, 2D light microscopy demonstrated that DPM adheres to human lung epithelial cells. Importantly, the slide preparation and confocal microscopy method applied avoids possible alteration to the particles’ surfaces and enables colour 3D visualisation of the particles. From twenty-one PM10 particles, the mean (standard deviation) major axis length was 5.6 (2.25) μm with corresponding values for the minor axis length of 3.8 (1.25) μm. These new findings may help explain why air pollution particulate matter (PM) has the ability to infiltrate human airway cells, potentially leading to respiratory tract, cardiovascular and neurological disease.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

"Local contributions to beta diversity in urban pond networks: implications for biodiversity conservation and management.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13094/","Hill, M.J; White, J; Biggs, J; Briers, R; Gledhill, D; Ledger, M; Thornhill, I; Wood, P.J; Hassall, C","February 2020","Aim:-    An understanding of how biotic communities are spatially organized is necessary to identify and prioritize habitats within landscape‐scale biodiversity conservation. Local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) identifies individual habitats that make a significant contribution to beta diversity and may have important practical implications, particularly for conservation of habitat networks. In this study, we develop and apply a conservation prioritization approach based on LCBD in aquatic invertebrate communities from 132 ponds. Location:-    Five urban settlements in the UK: Halton, Loughborough, Stockport, Birmingham and Huddersfield. Methods:-    We partition LCBD into richness difference (nestedness: RichDiffLCBD) and species replacement (turnover: ReplLCBD) and identify key environmental variables driving LCBD. We examine LCBD at two scales relevant to conservation planning: within urban settlements and nationally across the UK. Results:-    Significant differences in LCBD values were recorded among the five settlements. In four of the five urban settlements studied, pond sites with the greatest LCBD values typically showed high replacement values. Significant LCBD sites and sites with high taxonomic diversity together supported more of the regional species pool (70%–97%) than sites with high taxonomic diversity alone (54%–94%) or what could be protected by the random selection of sites. LCBD was significantly associated with vegetation shading, surface area, altitude and macrophyte cover. Main conclusions:-    Conservation prioritization that incorporates LCBD and sites with high taxonomic diversity improves the effectiveness of conservation actions within pond habitat networks, ensures sites supporting high biodiversity are protected and provides a method to define a spatial network of protected sites. Identifying new, effective conservation approaches, particularly in urban areas where resources may be scarce and conflicts regarding land use exist, is essential to ensure biodiversity is fully supported, and detrimental anthropogenic effects are reduced.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Producing elephant commodities for conservation hunting in Namibian communal-area conservancies.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13791/","Hewitson, L.J; Sullivan, S","February 2021","Namibia's internationally acclaimed CBNRM program depends to a large extent on revenues generated from the trophy hunting of wild animals. The model is an important example of an increasingly 'neoliberal' global policy framework as applied to biodiversity conservation, its market-based approach and attendant socio-ecological effects having received in-depth engagement and critique from a political ecology perspective.Yet there remains a lack of detailed research concerning how these programs and their value frames are operationalized in practice. The article attempts to advance this literature through an empirical exploration of practices undertaken by diverse actors that work to produce and extract value from 'wild' natures, specifically elephants for 'conservation hunting' in Namibian communal-area conservancies. Conceptually, the article also contributes to an emerging body of work seeking to 'ecologise' political ecology, exploring the co-optation of lively elephants and other beyond-human entities in the production of economic value. 'Following' the elephant's interactions with other living entities, the article reveals the (non)human work and social practices that together 'labor' to produce commodified elephants that can be killed as trophies. We argue that 'undesirable encounters' such as crop raiding by elephants are both indicative of unequal power relations amongst CBNRM stakeholders and central to (re)producing dominant (neoliberal) value frames. The animal's spontaneous activities are co-opted into technocratic governance practices that legitimize the killing of elephants on environmental and economic grounds. In opening up the contested,contingent, and more-than-human nature of these social-ecological relations we also hope to contribute to possibilities for imagining more equitable and ecologically resilient conservation futures.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

To help overcome this problem we have created open access online teaching materials in multiple languages that are stored in Applied Ecology Resources. So far, 117 educators from 23 countries have acknowledged the importance of this and are already teaching or about to teach skills in appraising or using evidence in conservation decision‐making. This includes 145 undergraduate, postgraduate or professional development courses.  4. We call for wider teaching of the tools and skills that facilitate evidence‐based conservation and also suggest that providing online teaching materials in multiple languages could be beneficial for improving global understanding of other subject areas.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

We find a distinct, simultaneous downturn (∼12 625 – 12 375 cal BP) in all tree‐ring proxies paralleling regional tree growth declines, suggesting a widespread climate deterioration. This downturn was characterised by sustained high precipitation, low temperatures and high relative humidity in NZ with incoming weather fronts from the South Ocean.

"Real world risk in speculative fiction: how can cognitive poetics be applied to the design of sound-led text games which incorporate difficult information?","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14355/","Bown, A","October 2021","This thesis documents a research project that applies cognitive poetics to the writing, design and build of three playable prototypes that combine text with spatial sound. Each prototype tells a different part of one original work of speculative fiction, the theme of which is species extinction. In order to focus the research on how texts can incorporate difficult information, the prototypes are designed with reference to narrative transportation theory. Narrative transportation is a psychological framework for measuring how involvement in a story can cause persuasive information to be absorbed and beliefs to be changed.   Throughout the thesis, three main lines of enquiry are pursued; how cognitive poetics can be used to develop an understanding of the psychological processes involved in reading, how this understanding can be used to create a user-centred writing approach, and how cognitive poetics can be synthesised with sound design theory and practice to create narrative transportation.  In part one of the thesis, the psychological processes involved in narrative transportation are researched through the application of cognitive poetics to readings of multiple texts. A specific aspect of cognitive poetics - cognitive grammar - is explored in detail, allowing for a synthesis of theories of linguistic grammar with musical grammar and cinematic sound design practice.   The second part of the thesis documents the iterative design process used to make the prototypes. During this process, design questions are addressed through the application of cognitive poetics, cinematic sound theory and musical grammar to the practice of multimodal writing. The user interaction designed into these prototypes is also informed by research into narrative transportation.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

The limited number of precisely dated, high-resolution proxy records, however, restricts our understanding of climate dynamics through the LG. Here, we present the first annually-resolved tree-cellulose stable oxygen and carbon isotope chronology (δ18Otree, δ13Ctree) covering the LG between ~14,050 – 12,795 cal BP, generated from a Swiss pine trees (P. sylvestris; 27 trees, 1255 years). Comparisons of δ18Otree with regional lake and ice core δ18O records reveal that LG climatic changes over the North Atlantic (as recorded by Greenland Stadials and Inter- Stadials) were not all experienced to the same degree in the Swiss trees. Possible explanations include: (1) LG climate oscillations may be less extreme during the summer in Switzerland, (2) tree-ring δ18O may capture local precipitation and humidity changes and/or (3) decayed cellulose and various micro-site conditions may overprint large-scale temperature trends found in other δ18O records. Despite these challenges, our study emphasises the potential to investigate hydroclimate conditions using subfossil pine stable isotopes.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"A case study exploring the impact of parental deployment on the wellbeing of British Army children in the pre-school year.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14044/","Normile, G","May 2021","This thesis explores the wellbeing of three to four-year-old British Army children experiencing a parental deployment during their pre-school year. Despite a recent increase in interest of the deployment-related experiences of school-aged service children, the deployment-related wellbeing of pre-school children has been under researched in the British context and they remain overlooked in terms of educational, social and Armed Forces policy.This study also seeks to clarify the use of the conceptually vague term wellbeing in the context of service children’s research through a consideration of the multiple discourses of wellbeing and an exploration of the component domains of wellbeing. Drawing upon both the bioecological model of development and cultural historical theory, the study explored how individual, social and environmental factors impact upon the different domains of pre-school children’s wellbeing during a parental deployment. A case study design focusing on ten children experiencing a parental deployment was employed within an Army Garrison in England.In each case, the deployed parent was the father.Interviews were conducted with the ten non-deployed mothers and fourteen pre-school practitioners working with the children. Six of the pre-school children also took part in the study via participatory research methods and interviews. Analysis of the data identified four distinct but interlinked domains of wellbeing that were impacted by the father’s deployment; psychological, physical, social and cognitive. These are discussed in relation to how they are influenced by factors of the individual child, their social relationships and factors relating to their environments. The thesis concludes by discussing the implications of this research for British educational, social and Armed Forces policy and practice in terms of supporting the wellbeing of pre-school children during times of a parental deployment.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Professional wargaming: a flawed but useful tool.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13197/","Curry, J","April 2020","Rationale for the Article:-   Professional wargames have long been an integral part of the tool set used by the military. The literature includes many examples of wargames that have been successful in terms of training, military education, procurement, operational analysis and planning for war. However, retrospective examination demonstrates that many of these professional wargames also had major errors in them and by implication current games about future confrontations are similarly flawed. Nevertheless, the academic evidence is clear that such games are still invaluable tools.  Methodology:-   Ten years of research into the development of wargames undertaken by the History of Wargaming Project has analysed and made generally available more professional wargames than ever before. Retrospective examination of a sample of these declassified games, from the British War Office Rules (1896) to more recent games about the Ukraine, shows significant errors.  Value:-   Demonstrating that professional games had errors in the past opens challenges the overconfidence in the predictive capacity of games. It also raises the possibility for future research to identify game design bias and to develop better games in the future. Understanding the value of better games, even with their inherent issues, raise the possibility of better preparing decision makers for the future.  Notes:-   The words wargame and game are used interchangeably in this article. Whilst the techniques used in professional gaming evolved from modelling the battlefield, modern professional gaming is increasingly focussed on other situations that are not war, such as state level confrontations, trade wars, politics, cyber conflict, banking crisis etc. Using the term wargame seems inappropriate when for example, gaming a shipping dispute. All the games referred to this article, unless otherwise noted, are professional wargames, used by military, government, public sector bodies and other parties directly involved in real world issues.

Focusing on the most commonly occurring consumer plastic items present in European freshwater environments, we identified and evaluated consumer-based actions with respect to their direct or indirect potential to reduce macroplastic pollution in freshwater environments. As the main end users of these items, concerned consumers are faced with a bewildering array of choices to reduce their plastics footprint, notably through recycling or using reusable items. Using a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis approach, we explored the effectiveness of 27 plastic reduction actions with respect to their feasibility, economic impacts, environmental impacts, unintended social/environmental impacts, potential scale of change and evidence of impact. The top ranked consumer-based actions were identified as: using wooden or reusable cutlery; switching to reusable water bottles; using wooden or reusable stirrers; using plastic free cotton-buds; and using refill detergent/ shampoo bottles. We examined the feasibility of top-ranked actions using a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) to explore the complexities inherent in their implementation for consumers, businesses, and government to reduce the presence of plastic in the environment.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Multi-proxy characterisation of the Storegga tsunami and its impact on the early Holocene landscapes of the southern North Sea.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13330/","Gaffney, V","July 2020","Doggerland was a landmass occupying an area currently covered by the North Sea until marine inundation took place during the mid-Holocene, ultimately separating the British landmass from the rest of Europe. The Storegga Event, which triggered a tsunami reflected in sediment deposits in the northern North Sea, northeast coastlines of the British Isles and across the North Atlantic, was a major event during this transgressive phase. The spatial extent of the Storegga tsunami however remains unconfirmed as, to date, no direct evidence for the event has been recovered from the southern North Sea. We present evidence of a tsunami deposit in the southern North Sea at the head of a palaeo-river system that has been identified using seismic survey. The evidence, based on lithostratigraphy, geochemical signatures, macro and microfossils and sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA), supported by optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon dating, suggests that these deposits were a result of the tsunami. Seismic identification of this stratum and analysis of adjacent cores showed diminished traces of the tsunami which was largely removed by subsequent erosional processes. Our results confirm previous modelling of the impact of the tsunami within this area of the southern North Sea, and also indicate that these effects were temporary, localized, and mitigated by the dense woodland and topography of the area. We conclude that clear physical remnants of the wave in these areas are likely to be restricted to now buried, palaeo-inland basins and incised river valley systems.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Reef fish biomass recovery within community-managed no take zones.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13820/","Gilchrist, H; Rocliffe, S; Anderson, L.G; Gough, C.L.A","April 2021","Locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) are increasingly recognised as a key strategy for small-scale fisheries management across the Indo-Pacific. When effective, LMMAs can encourage responsible fishing, strengthen compliance and improve adaptive capacity, and may help to safeguard food security, address coastal poverty and increase resource sustainability. However, evidence that LMMAs can achieve long-term biological goals is limited. Here, we used a six-year dataset and a before-after-control-impact sampling design to assess the biological effectiveness of five community-managed no take zones (CMNTZs) situated within the Velondriake LMMA in southwest Madagascar. Linear mixed-effect models revealed that the difference in biomass between control and reserve sites increased over time. Significant differences in biomass between CMNTZs and controls were only evident from year two onwards, with 189% more total biomass in CMNTZs than fished control sites by year six. There was no effect of CMNTZs on the biomass of fish families preferentially targeted by the local fishery, limiting the long-term fisheries benefits of this reserve network unless individual CMNTZs are made larger to accommodate the home ranges of fishery targeted families. There were however, reserve effects preventing the decline of untargeted fish families and species richness.  Importantly, these CMNTZs delivered a conservation benefit that rivals government-run NTZs in the region, against a backdrop of severe biomass depletion, coastal poverty and human dependence on fishing - illustrating their suitability as a solution to marine resource depletion in developing tropical countries.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"New goddess on Mount Paektu: myth and transformation in North Korean landscape.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13112/","Winstanley-Chesters, R","February 2020","North Korea’s 2015 New Year’s Address was replete with references to Mt Paektu, the highest mountain on the Korean peninsula, and to 2015 being the seventieth anniversary of the Liberation of the Korean peninsula from Japanese occupation. Two years later, 2017 saw the centennial anniversary of the birth of Kim Jong Suk, first wife of Kim Il Sung, mother of Kim Jong Il and grandmother of Kim Jong Un. It is perhaps not surprising that at these celebratory moments the landscapes central to Korean mountain cults, ancient and modern, come to the fore. This book suggests considering contemporary North Korean ideology and the importance of the Kim dynasty as having evolved from traditional Korean mountain beliefs and practices, centred on Mt Paektu. It examines the common cultural roots of modern North and South Korean mountain legend and suggests a certain methodological grid for its analysis. While much of the legend surrounding Kim Il Sung’s guerrilla resistance in the forests and valleys around Mt Paektu is determinedly masculine, Kim Jong Suk constitutes an authoritative female presence. As a bodyguard of Kim Il Sung and a champion of revolutionary struggle, Kim Jong Suk transcends both her defined gender role and her human nature. In order to transform from the young peasant girl into a great Revolutionary Mother and a symbol of the charismatic power of the Kim dynasty, Kim Jong Suk has to undergo difficult and painful trials and toils. In this recounting of her struggle Kim Jong Suk is both transfigured by and herself transfigures the terrain of the mountain, becoming a key player in the transformation of its slopes into the charismatic mythography of the North Korean present.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

"Everyday ecocide, toxic dwelling, and the inability to mourn: a speculative response to geographies of extinction.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/12283/","Jones, O; Rigby, K; Williams, L","June 2019","In responding to the spatiotemporally specific geographies of extinction charted in the articles in this special section, this article reflects on the sociocultural factors that inform the ways in which extinction is framed and impede recognition of the enormity of the anthropogenic extinction event in which we are all bound. This article argues that we are living in an era of ecocide, where the degradation of biodiversity and eradication of species go hand-in-hand with the degradation and eradication of nonmodern culture and identity, and it explores some possible reasons why modern society is failing to respond to impending crisis. Fine-grained stories of spatiotemporally specific geographies of extinction can help to counter the logic of colonization and bring everyday ecocide into view. For the particular multispecies communities they concern, they can also feed into the creation of ritual practices of penitential mourning in ways that enable a collective grieving process poised to activate an ecosocial transformation. The authors consider the implications of grief and mourning—and of not mourning—in what can be seen as not only a terrible time but also the end of (lived) time. They conclude with some reflections of local acts of resistance, witnessing, and narrative.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

"The biblical flood myth revisited: representations of flood and deluge in climate fiction.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15487/","Lancaster, C","July 2023","In this thesis, I demonstrate how the biblical flood myth is revisited in narrative framings of flood-related catastrophe in the climate novel. Despite the number of works that explore environmental concerns in relation to flooding, there has been a gap in research on the use of the biblical flood myth in climate novels that use floods as metaphorical and material indicators of climate change. I examine how the biblical flood myth is used in climate novels to explore existential questions around human ontology and ethics in a time of environmental uncertainty, and by doing so show how myth plays an important role in the way ecological calamity is imagined and experienced.  Myths, I argue, reflect historical processes and change over time as the cultures that maintain them change. Therefore, the first part of the thesis revisits reworkings of the biblical flood in novels that contribute to the development of climate fiction and form part of its prehistory, George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss (1860) in Chapter One, and D.H Lawrence's The Rainbow (1915) in Chapter Two. I explore the entangled historiographical and mythical elements of these novels from an ecocritical perspective.  The second part of the thesis explores the biblical flood myth in the climate novel. In Chapter Three, I discuss George Turner's The Sea and Summer ( 1987) as one of the first novels to address the potential future impacts of the historical trajectory of fossil fuelled industrialisation as critiqued by Eliot and Lawrence. I explore the ways in which it offers an apocalyptic vision of environmental collapse via deluge.  In Chapter Four, I examine how floods are used as a metaphor for ecological loss and grief in Barbara Kingsolver' s Flight Behaviour (2012) and Mireille Juchau' s The World Without Us (2015).  In Chapter Five, I explore environmental futurity in James Bradley's Clade (2015) and Lydia Millet's A Children's Bible (2020) through the metaphorical structure of rebirth and renewal acquired from the biblical flood narrative. Finally, the conclusion evaluates the ways in which the biblical flood myth contributes to environmentalist political imaginations.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"She appears a promising child: the role of the c19th orphanage in categorising young care leavers in terms of productive labour.  A critical case study of Mullers new orphan homes Dismissal Books 1830s-1890s.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15281/","Brooks, K","March 2023","This thesis uses Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to address the ways in which an evangelical Christian orphanage evaluates the potential productivity of its young people. Plymouth Brethren founder George Muller’s nineteenth century orphan homes, Bristol, were in their day, ‘a wonder even in this age of wonders’, housing over 2,000 orphans in five large institutional buildings. Orphans left around age 14 (boys) and 18 (girls), generally destined to work in labouring jobs as apprentices or in the domestic sector as servants. Covering the latter half of the nineteenth century, the study focuses on the language present in the institution’s Dismissal Books. These were ledgers listing the leaving date and destination of each young person, categorising them as ‘recommendable’ or ‘unrecommendable’ for work. These archive materials have not been used in scholarly research before now, and are not generally available to the public. The findings discussed in this thesis thus focus on this hitherto untold story. I start by using CDA to extend the existing archigraphic approaches to archival analyses, in order to answer calls for more epistemological clarity in archival practice (Moore et al 2016). In doing so I make more transparent the process between archival retrieval, and the eventual, interpretive analysis of materials. My findings reveal that the orphans who were deemed ‘unrecommendable’ were either expelled, or deemed unable to or unfit for work, or were categorised as failing to reach the standard of the Muller institution. These young people were not always returned to family members as the conventional history of the institution states, but could be sent to the workhouse. I use CDA to map out the classifications of these unrecommendable orphans into discursive patterns and themes. I go on to identify how these themes link to wider, ideological discursive formations present in nineteenth century thinking. As the theoretical underpinning for this analysis, I draw on Guery and Deleule’s (1972/2014) concept of the ‘productive body’ in nineteenth century capitalism, as used by Foucault (1977), as the thesis’ theoretical framework. In doing so, this thesis also rectifies the current marginalisation of education in Foucauldian ideas around discipline and dividing practices. This study contributes to wider dialogue, about class, power and the working body in the nineteenth century. The concept of the productive body enables me to show how the institution, whilst exhorting its evangelical rhetoric, works along lines of capitalist efficiency. Whilst the orphans’ souls are saved and their ‘characters’ converted, made respectable, through the institution’s drive for social reform and evangelical conversion, their bodies are judged in terms of productivity. Whilst some are judged fit, reformed and refined, the unrecommendable are deemed ‘spoiled’ products, excluded and marginalised. I go on to argue that such categorisations are ideologically and discursively entwined with the racialised perspectives of imperialist administration, eugenicist rhetoric and pseudo-scientific themes, which operate as nineteenth century, normative common sense. I suggest that the discourses present in the Dismissal Books create norms which bind together those who are ‘normal’ and productive into an imagined community (Anderson 2006) , and portray the unrecommendable, unproductive orphan, as ‘polluted, dangerous, taboo’ (Hall, 1997, p.258). Thus in this thesis’ account of the history of institutionalised care, the orphans are not perceived as ‘rescued’, but are instead conceptualised as fragmented subjects (Guery and Deleule 2014). They are not all saved, but selected. The orphanage, in its role as mediating authority, discursively invites the orphan to accept this process of selectivity and judgement of their working potential as inevitable, factual and true. Their categorisation is ‘proved’ by both the expert scientific observation of their body’s potential productivity by the institution authorities, and by the institution’s assertion that this is ‘the way things are’, and ‘God’s will.’ The child returned to the workhouse is thus conceptualised as belonging there. In setting out this account of the Muller New Orphan Homes in this way, it is acknowledged that this research has not been undertaken in order to denounce or accuse Muller, but in order to understand the discursive processes of the institution’s categorisations. This thesis is not undermining the good of these ‘good works’. Rather, it is locating Muller – for the first time - in the complex social, economic and cultural contexts of nineteenth century Britain, and mapping out, discursively, the ‘messier mingling of good intentions and blinkered prejudices’ (Koven 2004, p.3) which informed such works, as demonstrated in the Dismissal Books. This thesis illustrates how using critical methods of analysis can be used to deconstruct archival materials. It defines the institution as conceptualising, managing and educating the young people in care within the dominant values and ideologies of the time. In doing this, my research enables us to move away from the ‘grand narrative’ of the individual, pioneering reformist in history, and instead trace more critical and contextualising paths through the largely hidden histories of welfare and care.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"Applying insights on categorisation, communication, and dynamic decision-making: a case study of a ‘simple’ maritime military decision.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15008/","Edmunds, C.E.R ; Harris, A.J.L; Osman, M","October 2022","A complete understanding of decision-making in military domains requires gathering insights from several fields of study. To make the task tractable, here we consider a specific example of short-term tactical decisions under uncertainty made by the military at sea. Through this lens, we sketch out relevant literature from three psychological tasks each underpinned by decision-making processes: categorisation, communication and choice. From the literature, we note two general cognitive tendencies that emerge across all three stages: the effect of cognitive load and individual differences. Drawing on these tendencies, we recommend strategies, tools and future research that could improve performance in military domains – but, by extension, would also generalise to other high-stakes contexts. In so doing, we show the extent to which domain general properties of high order cognition are sufficient in explaining behaviours in domain specific contexts.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"Authentic-lite rhetoric: the curation of historical interpretations in Hearts of Iron IV.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14679/","Pennington, M.J","March 2022","This thesis argues that 'Hearts of Iron IV' (HoIIV) presents curated historical interpretations about the origins of the Second World War. These claims are demonstrated through the concept of authentic-lite rhetoric; public-facing historical interpretations produced by computation and text. The thesis identifies HoIIV’s National Focus Trees (NFTs), diagrams that document the progression of history, as ‘engines of causality’ which simultaneously conceive of a recognisable past and function to statistically support the player. The thesis examines how territorial expansion, economic and industrial development, and political ideology are disseminated to the player through the NFTs of the German Reich, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom. The thesis illustrates how HoIIV’s curated expressions of history present the Second World War as an inevitable conflict. Through systemic and textual abstraction, the NFTs amplify political events, but overlook cultural and social phenomena. The thesis creates a framework for exploring the NFTs through external paratexts, utilising the HOI4 Wiki online encyclopedia as a dominant source base. HOI4 Wiki openly disseminates all computational and textual information associated to the NFTs. By consulting an external object of digital game culture, the thesis examines how the history of the late-1930s is curated by the NFTs and presents an innovative approach for understanding how both game system and text reinterpret history. In this methodology, the thesis demonstrates that historical game studies scholarship can be conducted without direct access to a digital game. Ultimately, the thesis determines that HoIIV’s NFTs present a fractious epoch where totalitarian regimes are more effective in waging war than democratic states. The NFTs characterise democracies as burdened by bureaucracy, while totalitarian nations are regimes of political, military, and industrial dynamism. Through these curated expressions of history, the developer-curators portray the mid-to-late 1930s as a linear passage towards an inevitable global conflict.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"Developing a hydrofeminist art practice: bodies, spaces, practices.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14559/","Denning, L.R","February 2022","This research presents primary work that has been situated in the city of Plymouth (UK) – Benthic Caress (2017), Hydrosapien (2018) and Manual for Nomads (2020), supported by three bodies of exploratory work (Interim, Rhyne & Huish, Field Notes). Documentation of the work can be found here: https://aquameteor.wordpress.com/ This is a practice led PhD that seeks to make a contribution to knowledge by developing the concept of hydrofeminism, through practice. This work is practice-driven, and consciously situated within Environmental Humanities, and this thesis is foundationally and iteratively entangled with the practice. The thesis is undertaken in an interdisciplinary location of intersecting artistic practices, feminisms, posthumanism and cultural geographies, aiming to fold these entanglements into the emerging field of environmental humanities (Bird-Rose et al 2012). It is done through practice led research, thus extending hydrofeminism from its academic (text based) foundation in the work of Neimanis (2012). Water, specifically oceans, estuaries, rivers and other ‘natural’ bodies of water (including puddles) has been the material signifier across the body of work shared here, which is transdisciplinary and which has investigated hydrofeminism using a wide range of creative tools. The creative practice presented here is about water, explored through feminisms, hydrofeminism, transcorporeality, posthumanism and embodiment. Benthic Caress was a site-specific and site-responsive immersive experience that offered participants a sonic engagement with marine life using silent disco technologies. Hydrosapien was a public performance of a section of Hydrofeminism (Neimanis 2012) that pertains to ecotones, presented by a Silent Choir and two experimental voice artists. Manual for Nomads is a short film exploring community and the climate crisis that brings the languages, codes and methods of communication of differently abled persons together to create new conceptualisations of the ecotone.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"Project knole: an autocosmic approach to authoring resonant computational characters.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14392/","Sherman, R.P","November 2021","Project knole, consisting of this thesis and a mixed reality installation artwork centred around a computational simulation, is a practice-based response to the question of how a character in a work of computational narrative art might maintain their defining quality of dynamic agency within a system (arguably one of the key potentials of the form), while achieving the ‘resonant’ qualities of characters in more materially-static artforms. In all aspects of this project, I explore a new design philosophy for achieving this balance; between the authorship of a procedural computational system, and the ability of that system to ‘resonate’ with the imagination of an audience. This philosophy, which I term the ‘autocosmic’, seeks inspiration for the curation of audience response outside the obvious boundaries of artistic discipline, across the wider spectrum of human imaginative engagement; examples often drawn from mostly non-aesthetic domains. As well as defining the terms ‘resonance’ and ‘autocosmic’, and delineating my methodology more generally, this thesis demonstrates how the ‘autocosmic’ was employed within my creative work. In particular, it shows how some of the perennial problems of computational character development might be mediated by exploring other non-aesthetic examples of imaginative, narrative engagement with personified systems. In the context of this project, such examples come from the historio-cultural relationship between human beings and the environments they inhabit, outside of formal artistic practice. From this ‘autocosmic’ launchpad, I have developed an artwork that starts to explore how this rich cultural and biological lineage of human social engagement with systemic place can be applied fruitfully to the development of a ‘resonant’ computational character.","Navy","Bath Spa University"

"The evolution of a passive narrator & Half river, half sea: a novel.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14343/","McNally, D","October 2021","This thesis comprises a novel and a critical study. The novel is a first-person text which explores the narration of unrequited love. The critical study is a discussion of how a character narrating unrequited love can tend toward passivity. Its purpose is to find how my narrator evolved from one whose passivity was a weakness in the novel, to one in which it became a quality that merited attention.   In the Introduction I offer some background about why unrequited love is a subject that interests me and how I have used the theme before. I describe how initially in this novel, my narrator’s response to unrequited love was problematic for me, and why. In this context, I look at and give a definition of narrative passivity. I outline what type of narrator I realised I did want, and my intentions for the study. I also introduce the texts that sustained and supported me on the way.   Part One [Early Incarnations] looks back at the direction in which my originally unnamed and urban narrator was going. I explain why I felt the need to refigure him. I show how, during the process of developing him, I found he nevertheless retained some of his initial characteristics. I point to where the traces of these early iterations remain.  In Part Two [The Makings of Will] I discuss the concepts of passivity and agency in relation to my narrator. I look at what it means to be a protagonist and what I did to make my narrator both narrator and protagonist of this novel. I examine his relationships, including those that pre-date the novel. I show how the connections he forges serve to mitigate – rather than eradicate – his passivity, thereby making this aspect of him interesting as opposed to frustrating for a reader.  Part Three [The Division of Time] investigates how I organised the novel temporally.  There are two timeframes. Initially, neither was organised in a linear way. I explain the changes I undertook – namely rearranging events chronologically – and why; that is, in order to better reinforce the arc of my narrator’s growth. Finally, I reveal why the river is a crucial site within the novel and how it influenced my narrator’s development.  The Conclusion summarises my main discoveries during the creation of my narrator. In particular was the realisation that whilst his character need not be wholly determined by a narration of unrequited love, and indeed is not, the two are bound – and balanced – throughout.","Navy","Bath Spa University"

The study found that military wives' own education plays a secondary role to their serving partners' military careers; that the military promotes their roles as wives and mothers above adult educational opportunities; and that despite the widening participation agenda, an inflexible HE system further blocks educational opportunities for this group.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"A case study exploring the impact of parental deployment on the wellbeing of British Army children in the pre-school year.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14044/","Normile, G","May 2021","This thesis explores the wellbeing of three to four-year-old British Army children experiencing a parental deployment during their pre-school year. Despite a recent increase in interest of the deployment-related experiences of school-aged service children, the deployment-related wellbeing of pre-school children has been under researched in the British context and they remain overlooked in terms of educational, social and Armed Forces policy.This study also seeks to clarify the use of the conceptually vague term wellbeing in the context of service children’s research through a consideration of the multiple discourses of wellbeing and an exploration of the component domains of wellbeing. Drawing upon both the bioecological model of development and cultural historical theory, the study explored how individual, social and environmental factors impact upon the different domains of pre-school children’s wellbeing during a parental deployment. A case study design focusing on ten children experiencing a parental deployment was employed within an Army Garrison in England.In each case, the deployed parent was the father.Interviews were conducted with the ten non-deployed mothers and fourteen pre-school practitioners working with the children. Six of the pre-school children also took part in the study via participatory research methods and interviews. Analysis of the data identified four distinct but interlinked domains of wellbeing that were impacted by the father’s deployment; psychological, physical, social and cognitive. These are discussed in relation to how they are influenced by factors of the individual child, their social relationships and factors relating to their environments. The thesis concludes by discussing the implications of this research for British educational, social and Armed Forces policy and practice in terms of supporting the wellbeing of pre-school children during times of a parental deployment.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"Professional wargaming: a flawed but useful tool.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13197/","Curry, J","April 2020","Rationale for the Article:-   Professional wargames have long been an integral part of the tool set used by the military. The literature includes many examples of wargames that have been successful in terms of training, military education, procurement, operational analysis and planning for war. However, retrospective examination demonstrates that many of these professional wargames also had major errors in them and by implication current games about future confrontations are similarly flawed. Nevertheless, the academic evidence is clear that such games are still invaluable tools.  Methodology:-   Ten years of research into the development of wargames undertaken by the History of Wargaming Project has analysed and made generally available more professional wargames than ever before. Retrospective examination of a sample of these declassified games, from the British War Office Rules (1896) to more recent games about the Ukraine, shows significant errors.  Value:-   Demonstrating that professional games had errors in the past opens challenges the overconfidence in the predictive capacity of games. It also raises the possibility for future research to identify game design bias and to develop better games in the future. Understanding the value of better games, even with their inherent issues, raise the possibility of better preparing decision makers for the future.  Notes:-   The words wargame and game are used interchangeably in this article. Whilst the techniques used in professional gaming evolved from modelling the battlefield, modern professional gaming is increasingly focussed on other situations that are not war, such as state level confrontations, trade wars, politics, cyber conflict, banking crisis etc. Using the term wargame seems inappropriate when for example, gaming a shipping dispute. All the games referred to this article, unless otherwise noted, are professional wargames, used by military, government, public sector bodies and other parties directly involved in real world issues. The prefix professional has been omitted for brevity in most places.","Navy","Bath Spa University"

It will consider the nature of espionage and its language and structures. In particular it will reconsider the espionage games played by Richard and Ignatius White. These men were brothers, and members of a large exiled Irish family, and they were also members of the Irish exile community in Europe, and they took on an espionage role within the transnational intelligence networks of the diplomatic world of the late 1650s and early 1660s. Indeed by operating across state borders in the service of Spain, France, and England, the White brothers deliver a valuable example of how such ‘non-state’ (or at the least very loosely attached) actors could operate in what Alain Hugon has fittingly called Europe’s “monde du secret,” and how such people also became included in the state policy and diplomacy of their day.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"‘Faisons meieux’: Henry Bennet, Earl of Arlington and his political tactics.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/10817/","Marshall, A; Eagles, R; Dennehy, C.A","April 2018","This is an original essay on Henry Bennet, Earl of Arlington. Arlington learnt his political trade through holding government and court office: first, as a Secretary of State (1662-1674), and then as Lord Chamberlain (1674-1685) in the government of King Charles II. Thereby he was able to manage his daily position towards King, Court, and the Parliament in the period.   The project examines Arlington’s political tactics in detail - a micro-study over the period 1662-1675. It addresses a number of questions relating to Arlington’s so called ‘terreurs de lord Arlington’: his techniques of flattery; servility; dissimulation; disloyalty, sexual irregularity; and his silences and political hesitancy; in effect his supposed ‘timorousness’ as political tactics. And it will show how such presumed defects of character increasingly became part of the tensions in his career, caught, as he frequently was, between brazen ambition and fearful hesitancy. They also became an important part of this politician’s skills of self-presentation.   In recent decades, historians have explored the fascinating variety of ways in which various publics could engage in politics. This essay will take one politician as its subject matter, and use the techniques of micro-history. Finally, the project will seek to illuminate Arlington’s tactics by exploring three illustrations of him in political action: his successful wooing of ‘Madame’, as what he called ‘un bon Anglais’ (1668-1670); his triumph in January 1674, when he was forced into a resolute defence of his political career, having been accused in the House of Commons of being ‘the great conduit-pipe’ of corruption, and lastly his failures in his negotiations with the Prince of Orange in November 1674.

Two years later, 2017 saw the centennial anniversary of the birth of Kim Jong Suk, first wife of Kim Il Sung, mother of Kim Jong Il and grandmother of Kim Jong Un. It is perhaps not surprising that at these celebratory moments the landscapes central to Korean mountain cults, ancient and modern, come to the fore. This book suggests considering contemporary North Korean ideology and the importance of the Kim dynasty as having evolved from traditional Korean mountain beliefs and practices, centred on Mt Paektu. It examines the common cultural roots of modern North and South Korean mountain legend and suggests a certain methodological grid for its analysis. While much of the legend surrounding Kim Il Sung’s guerrilla resistance in the forests and valleys around Mt Paektu is determinedly masculine, Kim Jong Suk constitutes an authoritative female presence. As a bodyguard of Kim Il Sung and a champion of revolutionary struggle, Kim Jong Suk transcends both her defined gender role and her human nature. In order to transform from the young peasant girl into a great Revolutionary Mother and a symbol of the charismatic power of the Kim dynasty, Kim Jong Suk has to undergo difficult and painful trials and toils. In this recounting of her struggle Kim Jong Suk is both transfigured by and herself transfigures the terrain of the mountain, becoming a key player in the transformation of its slopes into the charismatic mythography of the North Korean present.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"The utility of narrative matrix games - a Baltic example.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/12373/","Curry, J","June 2019","Wargaming has long been an integral part of military training, operational analysis and military planning. This trend continues today with the military of some Western NATO countries currently adapting innovations from the hobby wargaming market into tools to improve their gaming. Narrative gaming techniques, first developed in the hobby space, have become established in professional wargaming as a means of modelling political conflict and non-kinetic aspects of conflict. This article describes the use of the Matrix Games narrative methodology using a case study of a present-day confrontation short of war in the strategically important Baltic Sea. It then discusses some issues around the use of Matrix Games, such as the challenge of keeping games on narrative track and letting the narrative emerge organically. It concludes that Matrix Games can serve an important role in gaming current and potential crises as they can rapidly be used to create a space where key stakeholders can develop their understanding by exploring specific situations.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"The changing exploitation of oysters (Ostrea edulis L. 1758) in late medieval and early modern England: a case study from Dudley Castle, West Midlands.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/11933/","Thomas, R; Law, M ; Browning, E; Hill, A; Small, R","March 2019","Analysis of over 4000 complete left oyster valves from late medieval and post-medieval Dudley Castle reveals the changing role of this perishable luxury over a 700-year period. Throughout the occupation, it seems that oysters were used as ingredients rather than served raw in the shell. A greater reliance on oyster consumption is apparent in the later fourteenth century, perhaps reflecting a more diverse diet amongst the aristocracy in the wake of the Black Death. An increased preference for mussels and whelks is also attested in the Tudor and early modern periods, reflecting changing perceptions of these foods.  Overall, it is likely that natural beds were exploited throughout the time that oysters were being brought to Dudley Castle; however, the evidence demonstrates a shift from limited exploitation of natural inter-tidal sources in the eleventh century towards the dredging of sub-littoral beds in later periods, with some possible translocation of oyster stock. Changes in the shape, size and appearance of the oyster shells suggest the source locales from which the oysters derived changed through time. A notable shift occurred in the fourteenth century, which could reflect changes in supply brought about by altered tenancy at Dudley Castle and/or disruptions to trade brought about by the Black Death. Future biochemical analyses are recommended to provide greater clarity on the origin of those sources.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"Fish, fishing and community in North Korea and neighbours: vibrant matter(s).","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/12950/","Winstanley-Chesters, R","February 2020","This book explores the histories and geographies of fishing in North Korea and the surrounding nations. With the ideological and environmental history of North Korea in mind, the book examines the complex interactions between local communities, fish themselves, wider ecosystems and the politics of Pyongyang through the lens of critical geography, fisheries statistics and management science as well as North Korean and more generally Korean and East Asian studies. There is increasing global interest in North Korea, its politics, people and landscapes, and as such, this book describes encounters with North Korean fishing communities, as well as unusual moments in the field in the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). It addresses fish, fishing infrastructure, fishing science and fishing statistics and other non-human elements of North Korean and other nations’ developmental regimes as actors and participants within them as much as humans and their technologies. The book enables readers to gain extensive insights into the aspirations and practices of fishing in North Korea and its neighbours, the navigation of difficult political and developmental situations and changing ecological realities in a time of environmental and climate crisis familiar to many across the globe.","Navy","Bath Spa University"

A Conservative MP since 1997 with a conservative background growing up a Vicar’s daughter and grammar school education, Mrs May’s sartorial choices have evolved to conform with an understanding of female MP’s as proxy men and to reflect British national dress as defined by tradition. However, within this conservative persona, a discordant note is struck by her choice of shoes. Not always neutral, in this article, her choice of fabric is examined as a form of ‘everyday resistance’. Compromised as these choices are, her choice of leopard print kitten heels is suggested as a form of subaltern resistance.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"Impact of ‘transition blind spots’ on Access to Higher Education Diploma students with a military background: why filling gaps in Information, Advice and Guidance matters.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/11543/","Macer, M","October 2018","This paper contributes to an under-researched area within the field of military-civilian transition. It explores innovatively the experiences of (mainly) ex-service personnel as they journey to and through ‘Access to Higher Education Diplomas’ (AHED), the majority having come from the lower ranks of the Army, to which many enlist with little or no formal qualifications.  Drawing upon empirical research, commissioned in response to anecdotal evidence which suggests a decline in the number of AHED students with a military background, the paper argues that gaps in Information, Advice and Guidance (IAG) on AHEDs contribute to what I have termed ‘transition blind spots’ in the trajectories of these Service Leavers (SL). By addressing the issues discussed in this paper, there is potential to mitigate impact from these ‘transition blind spots’ and facilitate the SL transition through the provision of fully-informed IAG on AHEDs. This paper concludes that this new concept might usefully be employed to identify and understand other challenges faced during military-civilian transition.","Navy","Bath Spa University"

One way to increase monitoring is through citizen science. ‘Citizen science’ is a term that we use in this chapter to describe the diverse approaches that involve people in monitoring in a voluntary capacity, thus including participatory monitoring in which people work collaboratively with scientists in developing monitoring. There is great unrealised potential for citizen science, especially in Asia and Africa. However, to fulfil this potential citizen science will need to meet local needs (for participants, communities and decision makers, including people's own use of the data and their motivations to participate) and support global needs for biodiversity monitoring (including the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets). Activities should be feasible (for participants to provide scientifically rigorous data) and useful (for data users, from local to global scales). We use examples from across the world to demonstrate how monitoring can engage different types of participants, through different technologies, to record different variables according to different sampling approaches. Overall, these examples show how citizen science has the potential to provide a step change in our ability to monitor biodiversity—and hence respond to threats at all scales from local to global.","Navy","Bath Spa University"

By suggesting a broader understanding of ‘the state’, the paper shows the variety of ways in which institutions within the state were, and remain, involved. Through spotlights on major turning points in the administrative framework, it further argues that nationalism has been more often mobilized to foster state preservation than the other way round and suggests to place nationalism alongside other motive forces to understand the rise and transformation of state involvement in preservation.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"Association and reassurance: local responses to the French Revolution in the Bath newspapers, 1789-1802.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/11571/","Grieves, K","October 2018","The people of the City of Bath and its surrounding areas were well served by newspapers in the last decade of the eighteenth century. These newspapers provided their readers with a digest of international and national news stories gleaned from the London press and, to a lesser extent, from other provincial newspapers. They carried advertisements for businesses and printed notices on behalf of various organisations. They dedicated column space to local news and announcements, and also provided a space for readers' opinions in the form of letters to the editor. This local content in the Bath newspapers reflected the concerns of the readership, which became particularly visible during the French Revolution.  Limited attention has yet been paid to local content in the provincial press, particularly with regard to its societal role. Indeed, many historians have dismissed the provincial press as amateurish and uniform. One notable exception is Hannah Barker who has argued that regional newspapers provide an insight into the local conditions in which they were created. Peter Clark has also recognised the pivotal role of provincial newspapers in facilitating the growth of an associational culture during the eighteenth century.  This dissertation provides a thematic case study on the role of the provincial press during a time of ideological and military conflict, drawing upon the local content of the Bath newspapers printed during this period. This is supplemented by newspapers printed in other urban centres  to provide a comparison with similar content in other provincial titles as well as demonstrating how other newspapers reported on Bath and its neighbourhood at that time. The themes that are explored include philanthropy, the presence of émigrés in the city, celebrations of royal anniversaries, the clash of radicals and loyalists, the county militia and the volunteer movement.  I argue that the main role of the Bath newspapers during the French Revolution was in promoting various forms of association in the city, which became increasingly inclusive over the period, particularly with regard to women and those of a lower social status. This increased participation in civil society laid the groundwork for later democratic reforms. At the same time, they painted a reassuring picture of a united, generous and well defended city at a troubling time.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"Introduction.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/9626/","Stenning, A; Walton, S","June 2017","Since the First World War, industrial warfare has harnessed the power of ‘nature’ to create ever-more efficient means of destroying human life through its use of chemical, biological and nuclear technology. At the same time, it has developed the potential to cause what has been termed ‘ecocide’, examples of which include the long-term impact of high-density herbicides in Vietnam, and the Kuwaiti oil fires. As in other areas of modern life, in warfare nature has been understood as: ‘either logistical problems to be overcome and defeated or opportunities to be exploited.’ Conflict in resource-deprived nations can lead to the mass-movement of refugees into environments that may not be able to support them. And yet, it was an investigation by the US military – in an attempt to control the environment – that led to the first research into climate change. Climate change itself has been regarded as an issue for ‘national security’, and a war that ‘we are fighting’.","Navy","Bath Spa University"

"Ecotypic variation in Lotus corniculatus L. and implications for grassland restoration: interaction of ecotypes with soil type and management, in relation to herbivory.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/7947/","Mortimer, E.J","July 2016","This research assesses the importance of using ecologically-similar rather than geographically-local seed in grassland restoration projects, with particular reference to herbivorous invertebrates, including pollinators. Seed from Lotus corniculatus L. (bird’s-foot trefoil) populations at nine sites across south-west England were collected to represent ecotypes potentially adapted to a range of soil types (calcareous loam, neutral loam and calcareous sand (referred to as ‘sand’)) and management regimes (grazed, cut with aftermath grazing (referred to as ‘cut’) and unmanaged). From October 2011 the ecotypes were planted within three different treatment soils (calcareous loam, neutral loam and calcareous sand (“sand”), and two management treatments (grazed [simulated] or unmanaged [neither cut or grazed]). Differences in plant morphology and phenology under these treatments were recorded at four-weekly intervals and immediately prior to harvest on 16th July 2012. Fresh and dry biomass were recorded and leaf-nitrogen and leaf-hydrogen cyanide (HCN) levels determined. Treatments were maintained and plants grown for a further 15 months [after harvest]. Bee preference for ecotypes grown under treatment combinations was also recorded during peak flowering periods of 2012 and 2013. Data were tested using Kruskall-wallis and ANOVA. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) was built to test all ecotype and treatment differences including interactions. A separate Non-linear Mixed Effects model (NLME) was created to investigate spatial autocorrelation between ecotype sites. The standard chosen in the models was Cockey Down (a calcareous loam, grazed ecotype) grown in matching treatments. The phenotypic traits retained were most pronounced in ecotypes from home-sites of sand soil type and cut management, which were considered to be the more stressed environments of the study, requiring rapid adaptation. By harvest, ecotypes from sand home-sites produced significantly greater number of stems per plant, greater leaflet number per main stem and lower HCN. Model results for sand ecotypes additionally identified delayed seed pod formation, increased hirsuteness and higher leaf-HCN compared to the standard. Significant differences found within ecotypes from cut home-sites included fewer stems per plant, fewer leaflets per main stem, more seeds per pod, greater leaf-HCN and shorter time to first flower. The model also found this ecotype to be less hirsute with fewer seed pods (in unmanaged treatment) than the standard. Ecotypic traits shown in plants from the less stressed home-sites included calcareous loam ecotypes having two clear flowering peaks in both years and highest leaf-HCN, and unmanaged ecotypes having lower leaf-HCN. Three significant interactions indicated additive character factor effects: neutral loam ecotypes grown in neutral loam treatment soil had earlier pod formation than the standard; and, sand ecotypes grown in sand treatment soil and unmanaged ecotypes receiving unmanaged treatment had greater flower number (over both years) than all other ecotypes, treatments and combinations. Results from the bee ecotype preference study showed no preference for ecotypes geographically close to the test foraging area. However significant differences were shown by bees in terms of ecotype preference, with avoidance of plants containing highest leaf-HCN. Plants grown in calcareous soil treatment were preferred which suggests nectar of plants are of most value to bees when grown in optimum [for L. corniculatus growth] soil. Ecotypic differences in herbivory defence [leaf-HCN and hirsuteness induced by home-site soil and management], would be of importance to receptor site invertebrate herbivores/pollinators. Pollinators could also find difficulties with the ecotypic differences in flowering asynchronicity. Both home-site soil type and management could also influence the viability of the plant population through reducing fecundity. Delayed seed pod formation in sand ecotypes (compared to the standard) indicates an adaptation to summer temperatures or low-nutrient availability. Calcareous loam ecotypes lack such adaptation and if introduced to a sand sites and could fail due to poorly timed germination, deep seed burial [from shifting sand] or poorly allocated energy. Cut ecotypes also produced significantly fewer seed pods (than the standard) with significantly greater seed numbers per pod suggesting an energy allocation adaptation to produce fewer, larger pods before defoliation rather than continuous pod formation throughout the season, a potentially critical adaptation for seed return. Findings from this study are of national relevance, and Natural England should adopt new recommendations on seed provenance in agri-environment schemes. Instead of recommending strictly geographically local seed, the management regime (particularly details of intensity and timing of management operations) should ideally be similar between the donor and receptor sites. Soil types, especially pH and clay/organic matter content should also be matched as far as possible as these were the greatest limiting factors within this study. Suitable donor sites may be local sites of similar habitat. If no such sites are available then recommendations from this study should be followed in seeking suitable sowing material. If seed suppliers are used, then they should provide greater detail on donor site conditions to aid land managers.","Navy","Bath Spa University"
"Rumor and ""common fame"": the impeachment of the Duke of Buckingham and public opinion in early Stuart England.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/7202/","Coast, D","February 2016","This article re-examines the parliamentary impeachment of the Duke of Buckingham, the royal favourite of King Charles I, by placing this event in the broader contexts of political culture and social change in early Stuart England. Buckingham’s enemies based the impeachment on “common fame,” claiming that his faults were a matter of public knowledge. Charles, however, believed that the charges were based on seditious rumors. The impeachment undercut an important element of elite rhetoric that associated rumor with the rebellious multitude, revealing ideological divisions over the nature of grievances and the legitimacy of popular speech. The article contextualizes the impeachment within 1620s underground literature that purported to present the views of the common people, arguing that there was a wider tendency to ventriloquize public opinion. When Buckingham's allies produced their own tracts featuring the persona of the “honest ploughman,” appeals to the authority of public opinion were clearly gaining in strength. By explaining this development in political culture with reference to the growth of a more politically reliable “middling sort”, the article contributes to debates about the relationship between social change and political conflict in early Stuart England.","Navy","Bath Spa University"

"Sylhetisation, dependence and ambivalence: a qualitative exploration of paan use amongst older Bangladeshi women in London.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/6274/","Mahendran, J","July 2015","This thesis introduces a novel and alternative way of understanding paan addiction among Bangladeshi women by exploring their lived experiences. There is growing medical evidence that paan, a mixture of betel leaf, areca nut, tobacco and white lime, is injurious to health, causing cancer, oral disease and addition (WHO, 2004). Paan use is prevalent and visible among the Bangladeshi community in East London. However, paan dependence is principally examined through the dominant medical model, which prioritises the scientific and pharmacological aspects. Research has yet to examine paan dependence from the user's perspective, which limits health and social care professionals from understanding the practice, the determinants of the habit and the elements contributing to its continued use. Understanding the user perspective would assist in designing and delivering appropriate and targeted interventions. There are no similar studies of this nature into paan use and therefore this study developed a theoretical framework by examining literature pertaining to migration, biographies and inequalities in health.  METHOD: An ethnographic study was conducted and data collected through extensive fieldwork followed by in-depth interviews with thirty Bangladeshi women in Tower Hamlets, East London, who have continuously used paan over a number of years. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling. Interview data was analysed thematically using grounded theory techniques (Glazer and Strauss, 1967) and then triangulated to compare and crosscheck the consistency of the research findings.  FINDINGS: Key research findings indicate that while health discourses have explained paan use simply as a result of physical addition to tobacco, exploring the biographical, historical and social context of paan use developed a deeper understanding of how the participants constituted the experience and meaning of paan addiction. Four key themes emerged - physical and psychological addiction, availability and social acceptance of paan chewing, lack of involvement in the wider social environment and 'Sylhetisation', (a concept introduced by this thesis to describe how the Bangladeshi community have created an environment similar to that of Sylhet). The main recommendation is that an understanding of the sociocultural aspects of paan use may help greatly in developing more culturally specific paan cessation strategies within tobacco policies.","Navy","Bath Spa University"

"Environment, politics and ideology in North Korea: landscape as political project.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/12954/","Winstanley-Chesters, R","March 2020","Environmental and developmental matters have long proved key to North Korea’s “revolutionary” industrial and economic strategies. They have equally been important to Pyongyang’s diplomatic and geo-political efforts both during the Warsaw Pact period and in our contemporary era following the collapse of its supportive and collaborative partners. However, while environmental issues have been very important to North Korea, academic analysis and commentary addressing this field of governmental and institutional functionality has been almost entirely lacking.  This book fills this analytical void. Taking a narrative view of developmental approach throughout the political and ideological history of North Korea, Winstanley-Chesters first considers its impact on its landscapes and topographies in general throughout the era of the Kim dynasty. Second, in light of recent academic analysis suggesting North Korea as a space of Charismatic politics, the book focuses on the specificity of individual developmental sectors and projects, such as those addressing forestry and hydrology, seeking to trace general trends into these more particular environmental fields.","Navy","Bath Spa University"

"A blessed asylum or a utopian vision : the viability of a Protestant nunnery in early nineteenth-century England.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/5158/","Collier, J","January 2015","In 1694, Mary Astell proposed the establishment of Protestant nunneries in England; in 1809, Helena Whitford reiterated the theme; yet, it was Lady Isabella King in 1816 who sought to put this radical idea into effect. A single, Irish, evangelically influenced gentlewoman, a younger daughter of the Earl of Kingston, she established the Ladies’ Association, a ‘conventual’ home for eighteen distressed gentlewomen at Bailbrook House in Bath in 1816, securing support for it from such influential figures as Queen Charlotte, William Wilberforce and Robert Southey. When Bailbrook House was sold in 1821, she relocated the Ladies’ Association to Clifton in Bristol, where its eventual failure in 1835 shattered her vision of establishing a national scheme of conventual homes that would benefit future generations of women. Limited attention has yet been paid by historians to the role elite women played in creating and managing philanthropic institutions in the early nineteenth century, particularly those aimed at assisting other women in an urban setting. Some historians of philanthropy, such as Frank Prochaska, have identified an ‘explosion’ of early nineteenth-century female activity; however, elite women’s charitable contributions have tended to be understood as rural, concentrating on family estates. Kim Reynolds, who has addressed Victorian elite women’s philanthropy in an urban setting, maintains it functioned simply as a strand of elite women’s work. This dissertation draws upon a previously unstudied collection of papers compiled and annotated by Lady Isabella King, which span the existence of the Ladies’ Association, in order to explore the nature of Lady Isabella’s involvement in this philanthropic venture and her understanding of her role. Thus it not only seeks to recover Lady Isabella as an important historical figure in the development of early nineteenth-century philanthropic ventures, something for which she was recognised by her contemporaries, but also to examine the structure of her unique experimental institution and cast some light on the sorts of women who became its residents. By doing so, it provides a case study in the development and practical application of a philanthropic ideal. It examines the ways that Lady Isabella, quite a conventional elite single woman, used her status, her location and her networks to create and maintain the institution for nearly twenty years. It provides a valuable opportunity to examine a number of the problems she faced in establishing and running the institution, given the social and gendered milieu in which she was operating, and the strategies she employed to achieve her ends. I argue that Lady Isabella’s elite status provided her with the wealth and access to influential social circles to make a difference, that her single status added independence to devote time to her cause and while she was initially beset with self-doubts about her competence to author and manage the project, she gradually gained confidence as she developed ways to implement and manage the institution. At the same time the groundbreaking nature of the Ladies’ Association, the consequent public criticism and a growing discordant atmosphere among the residents of the institution lead to its closure in 1835.","Navy","Bath Spa University"

"Who has been tampering with these pianos?: The surrealist writings of Montagu O’Reilly (Wayne Andrews).","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/1654/","Hugill, A","January 2014","This article makes a case for Wayne Andrews as a neglected and original voice in American surrealism. The article begins by examining his periodical La revue de l'élite (1930-33) (later La revue intime and Demain) as evidence of his early interest in European avant-gardism. Next, it offers close readings of the short stories he wrote under the nom de plume “Montagu O'Reilly.” Within overtly surrealist narratives, these stories conceal a series of encounters between a sickly European high culture, characterised by consumptive girls, imperilled aristocrats, failing pianos and a vigorous American materialism, represented by thrusting bankers, ostentatious socialites, gleaming technologies. They provide a novel twist on some of the familiar tropes of surrealism, but also reveal something of how its revolutionary vision was subtly undermined during its transatlantic passage.

"The ripple effects of CBDC-related news on Bitcoin returns: insights from the DCC-GARCH model.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15689/","Akin, I ; Khan, Z.M; Hameed, A; Satiroglu, H","September 2023","Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have emerged as a potential substitute for current payment methods, and, as such, major announcements, events and policy discussions regarding CBDCs have the potential to influence cryptocurrency returns. In light of this, the present study undertakes an in-depth analysis of the CoinMarketCap data between August 1, 2017 and April 1, 2022 by implementing the dynamic conditional correlation-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) model. The study reveals a noteworthy influence of news and events related to CBDCs on Bitcoin returns. Precisely, CBDC uncertainty index and CBDC attention index have resulted in significant fluctuations in Bitcoin returns, indicating that positive news can result in significant Bitcoin returns. The findings suggest that future expectations of investors regarding cryptocurrencies are shaped by CBDC-related news and events.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Worldviews about change: their structure and their implications for understanding responses to sustainability, technology, and political change.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15438/","Bain, P.G; Bongiorno, R; Tinson, K; Heanue, A; Gómez, Á; Guan, Y; Lebedeva, N; Kashima, E; González, R; Chen, S.X; Blumen, S; Kashima, Y","July 2023","People hold different perspectives about how they think the world is changing or should change. We examined five of these “worldviews” about change: Progress, Golden Age, Endless Cycle, Maintenance, and Balance. In Studies 1–4 (total N = 2733) we established reliable measures of each change worldview, and showed how these help explain when people will support or oppose social change in contexts spanning sustainability, technological innovations, and political elections. In mapping out these relationships we identify how the importance of different change worldviews varies across contexts, with Balance most critical for understanding support for sustainability, Progress/Golden Age important for understanding responses to innovations, and Golden Age uniquely important for preferring Trump/Republicans in the 2016 US election. These relationships were independent of prominent individual differences (e.g., values, political orientation for elections) or context-specific factors (e.g., self-reported innovativeness for responses to innovations). Study 5 (N = 2140) examined generalizability in 10 countries/regions spanning five continents, establishing that these worldviews exhibited metric invariance, but with country/region differences in how change worldviews were related to support for sustainability. These findings show that change worldviews can act as a general “lens” people use to help determine whether to support or oppose social change.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Going beyond established model systems of Alzheimer’s disease: companion animals provide novel insights into the neurobiology of aging.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15400/","de Sousa, A.A ; Rigby Dames, B.A; Graff, E.C; Mohamedelhassan, R; Vassilopoulos, T; Charvet, C.J","June 2023","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by brain plaques, tangles, and cognitive impairment. AD is one of the most common age-related dementias in humans. Progress in characterizing AD and other age-related disorders is hindered by a perceived dearth of animal models that naturally reproduce diseases observed in humans. Mice and nonhuman primates are model systems used to understand human diseases. Still, these model systems lack many of the biological characteristics of Alzheimer-like diseases (e.g., plaques, tangles) as they grow older. In contrast, companion animal models (cats and dogs) age in ways that resemble humans. Both companion animal models and humans show evidence of brain atrophy, plaques, and tangles, as well as cognitive decline with age. We embrace a One Health perspective, which recognizes that the health of humans is connected to those of animals, and we illustrate how such a perspective can work synergistically to enhance human and animal health. A comparative biology perspective is ideally suited to integrate insights across veterinary and human medical disciplines and solve long-standing problems in aging.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"From fossils to mind.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15324/","de Sousa, A.A ","June 2023","Fossil endocasts record features of brains from the past: size, shape, vasculature, and gyrification. These data, alongside experimental and comparative evidence, are needed to resolve questions about brain energetics, cognitive specializations, and developmental plasticity. Through the application of interdisciplinary techniques to the fossil record, paleoneurology has been leading major innovations. Neuroimaging is shedding light on fossil brain organization and behaviors. Inferences about the development and physiology of the brains of extinct species can be experimentally investigated through brain organoids and transgenic models based on ancient DNA. Phylogenetic comparative methods integrate data across species and associate genotypes to phenotypes, and brains to behaviors. Meanwhile, fossil and archeological discoveries continuously contribute new knowledge. Through cooperation, the scientific community can accelerate knowledge acquisition. Sharing digitized museum collections improves the availability of rare fossils and artifacts. Comparative neuroanatomical data are available through online databases, along with tools for their measurement and analysis. In the context of these advances, the paleoneurological record provides ample opportunity for future research. The biomedical and ecological sciences can benefit from paleoneurology's profound approach to understanding the mind as well as its novel research pipelines that correlate neuroanatomy to genes and behavior.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"The desert burns clean: the challenge of conveying accurate science through embodied characters in science fiction.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15367/","Kirby, B.K","June 2023","This thesis is comprised of two parts: a novel, The Desert Burns Clean, and a contextualizing exegesis. Together, these two elements allow me to explore the challenge of accurately portraying the facts of a complex scientific reality while still accessing the truth of the human body experience. To achieve this, I utilize a variety of technical craft strategies in my fiction, while examining and reflecting upon them in my contextualizing exegesis in ways that I hope will be of use to other writers and critics. Based on current scientific research, the novel is set in a future where optimal health—complete with long life—is available for those who can afford it through regular microbial inoculations begun at birth. In this fictional world, fertility rates have dropped, and epidemics have become common. Against this backdrop, I have created five protagonists who are diverse in terms of their genders as well as their cultural, educational, and racial backgrounds. They must work towards trusting each other to overcome the machinations of a wealthy and politically powerful owner of a fertility clinic who wants to exploit their bodies for her illicit research. The contextual component of my thesis examines the strategies I use to incorporate accurate scientific information in the novel through the embodied experiences of my characters. My first strategy is that of worldbuilding. Here, the scientific information is not overtly present in the text but provides the “natural laws” of the world and how the characters will experience it. With worldbuilding, an accurate foundation of current science is laid from which all other aspects of story will be grounded. Secondly, I explore four forms of exposition through which I relate scientific information overtly through my characters. Finally, I discuss the benefits, challenges, and limitations of conveying information through characters’ body experiences. We cannot escape the fact that information is processed in and through our bodies. Thus, fundamental to my argument and methodology is the premise that grounding information and knowledge in human body experience offers writers an important strategy for conveying complex scientific information accurately in a work of science fiction.","Ai","Bath Spa University"

Thus, this chapter is being addressed from that standpoint. That is, looking into the deeper levels of social reality where young people are embedded, in particular, students’ relationship with open and participatory tools in HE. I will explore how educators can offer pedagogical opportunities for open educational practices that enable students’ explorative and critical mindset, so that they transcend the blind acceptance of the socio-political structures within which they are embedded. In so doing, they can question apparatuses and structures that perpetuate mechanisms of surveillance capitalism (Zuboff, S, The age of surveillance capitalism: the fight for a human future at the new frontier of power. Profile Books, 2019). Hopefully, students will be able to shape an alternative world in which they reflexively engage with alternative and more holistic digital practices.","Ai","Bath Spa University"

Aging is the major risk factor for these neurodegenerative diseases. Researching the evolutionary and molecular underpinnings of aging helps to reveal elements of the typical aging process that leave individuals more vulnerable to neurodegenerative pathologies. Very little is known about the prevalence and susceptibility of neurodegenerative diseases in nonhuman species, as only a few individuals have been observed with these neuropathologies. However, several studies have investigated the evolution of lifespan, which is closely connected with brain size in mammals, and insights can be drawn from these to enrich our understanding of neurodegeneration. This chapter explores the relationship between the typical aging process and the events in neurodegeneration. First, we examined how age-related processes can increase susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases. Second, we assessed to what extent neurodegeneration is an accelerated form of aging. We found that while at the phenotypic level both neurodegenerative diseases and the typical aging process share some characteristics, at the molecular level they show some distinctions in their profiles, such as variation in genes and gene expression. Furthermore, neurodegeneration of the brain is associated with an earlier onset of cellular, molecular, and structural age-related changes. In conclusion, a more integrative view of the aging process, both from a molecular and an evolutionary perspective, may increase our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.","Ai","Bath Spa University"

Her proposal, nevertheless, could equally apply to the amateur craft groups, community organisations and independent businesspeople that the Arts and Humanities Research Council–funded projects Co-Producing CARE: Community Asset-based Research and Enterprise, and Maker-Centric: Building Place-based, Co-making Communities worked with in deprived inner-city areas in the British Midlands. Both projects were undertaken with Craftspace and other stakeholder organisations, worked collaboratively with community groups, employed co-production processes and combined hand-making with digital fabrication. The aim of each project was to prototype a method with communities that builds agencies (cultural, social, economic, skills-based) through making and could be applied by other groups. While the CARE method was concerned with the affordances of collaborative making, Maker-Centric looked at these through a heritage and placed-based lens.

A focus of this use was the availability of valued foods, especially melons of the !nara (Acanthosicyos horridus). Three photographed encounters provide focus for a narrative connecting memories about the northern Namib that stretch back to the first European colonial journeys into this remote area of north-west Namibia.

This risks introducing ‘noise’ in the results, often obscuring effects that might be detected in less inclusive clades. Here, we focus on a sample of endocranial volumes (endocasts) of 18 species of rabbits and hares (Lagomorpha: Leporidae), which are a discrete radiation of mammals with a suitably large range of body sizes. Using 60 individuals, we test five popular hypotheses on brain size and olfactory bulb evolution in mammals. We also address the pervasive issue of missing data, using multiple phylogenetic imputations as to conserve the full sample size for all analyses. Our analyses show that home range and burrowing behaviour are the only predictors of leporid brain size variation. Litter size, which is one of the most widely reported constraints on brain size, was unexpectedly not associated with brain size. However, a constraining effect may be masked by a strong association of litter size with temperature seasonality, warranting further study. Lastly, we show that unreasonable estimations of phylogenetic signal (Pagel’s lamba) warrant additional caution when using small sample sizes, such as ours, in comparative studies.","Ai","Bath Spa University"

From the literature, we note two general cognitive tendencies that emerge across all three stages: the effect of cognitive load and individual differences. Drawing on these tendencies, we recommend strategies, tools and future research that could improve performance in military domains – but, by extension, would also generalise to other high-stakes contexts. In so doing, we show the extent to which domain general properties of high order cognition are sufficient in explaining behaviours in domain specific contexts.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Anime in the UK: the history, cultural context, and evolution of UK anime fandom.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14677/","Holmes, L.M","March 2022","Organised anime fandom in the UK is relatively young, having originated in the early ’90s following the UK’s first recorded anime screening programme at a convention (McCarthy, 2018a) and, shortly thereafter, the success of Ōtomo Katsuhiro’s Akira (1988) and the launch of Manga Video. However, while it is tempting to take this as the absolute genesis of UK anime fandom, to do so is to decontextualise both anime and anime fandom in the UK – neither occurred in isolation, nor did either spring up overnight. In this thesis I examine the history and dynamics of anime fans and fandom in the UK, but rather than beginning with this obvious starting point, I work through the pre-history of fandom, identifying the localised, “culturally odourless” (Iwabuchi, 1998) titles screened on television or in the cinema that served to catch the attention of young people who would become fans. But more than that, I seek to contextualise anime fandom – and the ways in which the medium of anime was perceived by the British press and public – in terms of Anglo-Japanese diplomacy and the ways that the British have historically responded to Japanese art and culture since the late nineteenth century. I also explore the main sites of change in anime fandom – the Video Nasties panic of the ’90s, the mass popularity of Pokémon (1997-Present), the Academy Awards success of Spirited Away (2001), and the rise of the Internet – and, inspired by Azuma Hiroki (2001), I survey current UK anime fans to identify where generational lines can be drawn, how these generations differ, and what they have in common. Finally, I suggest possibilities for extended and intersectional study of UK anime fans and speculate about what the future may hold for anime fandom… and whether anime has succeeded in truly achieving mainstream status.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Authentic-lite rhetoric: the curation of historical interpretations in Hearts of Iron IV.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14679/","Pennington, M.J","March 2022","This thesis argues that 'Hearts of Iron IV' (HoIIV) presents curated historical interpretations about the origins of the Second World War. These claims are demonstrated through the concept of authentic-lite rhetoric; public-facing historical interpretations produced by computation and text. The thesis identifies HoIIV’s National Focus Trees (NFTs), diagrams that document the progression of history, as ‘engines of causality’ which simultaneously conceive of a recognisable past and function to statistically support the player. The thesis examines how territorial expansion, economic and industrial development, and political ideology are disseminated to the player through the NFTs of the German Reich, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom. The thesis illustrates how HoIIV’s curated expressions of history present the Second World War as an inevitable conflict. Through systemic and textual abstraction, the NFTs amplify political events, but overlook cultural and social phenomena. The thesis creates a framework for exploring the NFTs through external paratexts, utilising the HOI4 Wiki online encyclopedia as a dominant source base. HOI4 Wiki openly disseminates all computational and textual information associated to the NFTs. By consulting an external object of digital game culture, the thesis examines how the history of the late-1930s is curated by the NFTs and presents an innovative approach for understanding how both game system and text reinterpret history. In this methodology, the thesis demonstrates that historical game studies scholarship can be conducted without direct access to a digital game. Ultimately, the thesis determines that HoIIV’s NFTs present a fractious epoch where totalitarian regimes are more effective in waging war than democratic states. The NFTs characterise democracies as burdened by bureaucracy, while totalitarian nations are regimes of political, military, and industrial dynamism. Through these curated expressions of history, the developer-curators portray the mid-to-late 1930s as a linear passage towards an inevitable global conflict.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Meme - a novel & In search of digital gothic.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14720/","Teasdale, B","April 2022","This doctoral thesis comprises a novel, Meme, which I consider to be in the new genre of digital gothic, and a piece of contextualising research, In Search of Digital Gothic. Meme tells the story of Scarlett, a PhD student in Digital Anthropology who stumbles across the existence of an ancient folk tale that is so disturbing, frightening or dangerous that it has always been forbidden from being shared. Scarlett comes to believe that the tale was leaked onto the internet, and sets out to track it down. In doing so, she discovers it may have played a role in the death of her brother Nathan, whose suicide some years before has left her traumatised and unable to connect with the world around her.  In my contextualising research, I explain how I was drawn to the ""digital gothic"" as a way to express the sense that, beneath the perfect sheen of our twenty-first-century digitally mediated lives, there are troubling and ambiguous forces that border on the uncanny. The Gothic as a genre is a natural correlative or container for such ideas, and my project explores existing manifestations of the digital gothic in both prose fiction and multimedia works.  In Part II, ""Infectious Media"", I examine the behaviour of 'memes', and analyse their unsettling features as 'uncanny replicators' that display 'uncanny metalepsis'. I draw comparisons with Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), arguing that Dracula is in essence -a meme; and with the ghost stories of M.R. James, in particular ""The Mezzotint"" (1904), where multimedia objects repeatedly breach their protective frames.  Part Ill, ""Digital Masks, Digital Ghosts"", explores 'presence' in the digital age, with a focus on the haunting possibilities inherent in social media and communications, anonymity and trolling. I use the recent cinematic subgenre of webcam horror (Unfriended, Cam, Host) to examine the notion of the digital ghost.  Finally, in Part IV, ""Haunted Mazes"", I discuss the manifestation of 'uncanny time' and 'interactivity' in the digital gothic, utilising the metaphor of the maze or labyrinth. I use the Jacques Derrida/Mark Fisher concept of 'hauntology' as a frame to examine these themes in the M. R. James ghost story ""Mr Humphreys and his Inheritance"" (1911), and Charlie Brooker's interactive television episode, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch (2018).   Taken together, the novel and the contextual research offer an innovative creative­critical undertaking that nonetheless draws upon an existing tradition of literary work, and resonates meaningfully with the wider culture beyond it.","Ai","Bath Spa University"

To unravel the similarities between blind individuals and blind species, we review concepts of ""blindness"" and its behavioral correlates across a range of species. We explore the ancestral emergence of vision in vertebrates, and the loss of vision in blind species with reference to an evolution-based classification scheme. We applied phylogenetic comparative methods to a mammalian tree to explore the evolution of visual acuity using ancestral state estimations. Future research into the natural history of vision loss could help elucidate the function of vision and inspire innovations in how to address vision loss in humans.","Ai","Bath Spa University"

Ultrasonic mid-air haptic perception has solely been investigated for glabrous (hairless) skin, which has higher tactile sensitivity than hairy skin. In contrast, the VHI paradigm typically targets hairy skin without comparisons to glabrous skin. The aim of this article was to investigate illusory body ownership, the applicability of ultrasonic mid-air haptics, and perceived immersion in VR using the VHI. Fifty participants viewed a virtual hand being stroked by a feather synchronously and asynchronously with the ultrasonic stimulation applied to the glabrous skin on the palmar surface and the hairy skin on the dorsal surface of their hands. Questionnaire responses revealed that synchronous stimulation induced a stronger VHI than asynchronous stimulation. In synchronous conditions, the VHI was stronger for palmar stimulation than dorsal stimulation. The ultrasonic stimulation was also perceived as more intense on the palmar surface compared to the dorsal surface. Perceived immersion was not related to illusory body ownership per se but was enhanced by the provision of synchronous stimulation.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Online opera: an applied collision of opera and web creativity.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14406/","Scott, L.T.D","November 2021","This practice-based research explores the collision of opera and web creativity through the development and evaluation of a new 'online opera' called ""The Village"" (2015). Contrasting existing offerings that position the web as a means of disseminating more familiar representations of opera, ""The Village"" draws on concepts of participatory culture, digital storytelling and co-creativity to advance a culturally novel apprehension of online opera that treats the web as a unique creative space. This interpretation is intrinsically digital, unable to be realised through conventional forms of theatrical presentation, and transformative in its approach to the core elements of opera. ""The Village"" in additional serves as a vehicle to investigate how the phenomenon of 'liveness' - that is, a feeling of 'now-ness' experienced in live performance - may be reimagined in the context of an entirely mediated opera. A range of theoretical perspectives are drawn on to establish a set of liveness devices that attempt to evoke in visitors to ""The Village"" a sense of contemporaneity and shared experience. These include temporal alignment between virtual and real-world events and the facilitation of social interaction through a narrative mechanism called the 'Digital Chorus', amongst others. Evaluative activities critique the effectiveness of such devices, and offer means in which they may be modified to better construct 'the live'.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Project knole: an autocosmic approach to authoring resonant computational characters.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14392/","Sherman, R.P","November 2021","Project knole, consisting of this thesis and a mixed reality installation artwork centred around a computational simulation, is a practice-based response to the question of how a character in a work of computational narrative art might maintain their defining quality of dynamic agency within a system (arguably one of the key potentials of the form), while achieving the ‘resonant’ qualities of characters in more materially-static artforms. In all aspects of this project, I explore a new design philosophy for achieving this balance; between the authorship of a procedural computational system, and the ability of that system to ‘resonate’ with the imagination of an audience. This philosophy, which I term the ‘autocosmic’, seeks inspiration for the curation of audience response outside the obvious boundaries of artistic discipline, across the wider spectrum of human imaginative engagement; examples often drawn from mostly non-aesthetic domains. As well as defining the terms ‘resonance’ and ‘autocosmic’, and delineating my methodology more generally, this thesis demonstrates how the ‘autocosmic’ was employed within my creative work. In particular, it shows how some of the perennial problems of computational character development might be mediated by exploring other non-aesthetic examples of imaginative, narrative engagement with personified systems. In the context of this project, such examples come from the historio-cultural relationship between human beings and the environments they inhabit, outside of formal artistic practice. From this ‘autocosmic’ launchpad, I have developed an artwork that starts to explore how this rich cultural and biological lineage of human social engagement with systemic place can be applied fruitfully to the development of a ‘resonant’ computational character.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Evaluating the clinical feasibility of an artificial intelligence–powered, web-based clinical decision support system for the treatment of depression in adults: longitudinal feasibility study.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14939/","Popescu, C","September 2022","Background:-   Approximately two-thirds of patients with major depressive disorder do not achieve remission during their first treatment. There has been increasing interest in the use of digital, artificial intelligence–powered clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to assist physicians in their treatment selection and management, improving the personalization and use of best practices such as measurement-based care. Previous literature shows that for digital mental health tools to be successful, the tool must be easy for patients and physicians to use and feasible within existing clinical workflows.    Objective:-   This study aims to examine the feasibility of an artificial intelligence–powered CDSS, which combines the operationalized 2016 Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments guidelines with a neural network–based individualized treatment remission prediction.    Methods:-   Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was adapted to be completed entirely remotely. A total of 7 physicians recruited outpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria. Patients completed a minimum of one visit without the CDSS (baseline) and 2 subsequent visits where the CDSS was used by the physician (visits 1 and 2). The primary outcome of interest was change in appointment length after the introduction of the CDSS as a proxy for feasibility. Feasibility and acceptability data were collected through self-report questionnaires and semistructured interviews.    Results:-   Data were collected between January and November 2020. A total of 17 patients were enrolled in the study; of the 17 patients, 14 (82%) completed the study. There was no significant difference in appointment length between visits (introduction of the tool did not increase appointment length; F2,24=0.805; mean squared error 58.08; P=.46). In total, 92% (12/13) of patients and 71% (5/7) of physicians felt that the tool was easy to use; 62% (8/13) of patients and 71% (5/7) of physicians rated that they trusted the CDSS. Of the 13 patients, 6 (46%) felt that the patient-clinician relationship significantly or somewhat improved, whereas 7 (54%) felt that it did not change.    Conclusions:-   Our findings confirm that the integration of the tool does not significantly increase appointment length and suggest that the CDSS is easy to use and may have positive effects on the patient-physician relationship for some patients. The CDSS is feasible and ready for effectiveness studies.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Students beliefs about learning English as a foreign language in wartime: the experience of Damascus University from 2017 to 2020.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14376/","Abdul Hadi, R","October 2021","This research investigates the factors that have affected Damascus University students' attitudes towards learning English as a foreign language and have, as a consequence, led to their poor English exam results during the war in Syria. Given that learners' attitudes towards and progress in language learning are directly associated with their beliefs about language learning, this research argues that learners' beliefs are contextually conditioned and responsive to the surrounding environment and can as a result affect their attitudes towards and success in the target language. To this end, an explanatory sequential mixed-methods methodology combining three approaches within the theoretical framework of Dewey's (1938, 1916) concept of experience was employed using a modified version of Horwitz's (2012) Beliefs About Language Learning Inventory (BALLI 2.0) survey and utilising semi-structured interviews. The research has found that two major sets of factors, namely internal factors, including cognitive and affective constructs associated with the students, and external/objective factors relating to the learning context and the overall environment surrounding the students, have interacted with each other and contributed to creating contradictions in the students' language learning beliefs, which eventually influenced their attitudes and final exam results. The research has also found that some of the students' language learning beliefs were variable, responsive to context, and some others were stable, resisting change. Also, the students' motivation and strategy use were found to be context-driven. Theoretically, this research contributes to the field of language learning beliefs in that it emphasises the role of context in constructing and shaping learners' beliefs and experiences, including the interplay between learners and their context. It is the first study to investigate learners' beliefs about foreign language learning in wartime. It also contributes to the scant studies investigating Arab learners' beliefs about language learning. Methodologically, this research utilises three approaches to investigating language learning beliefs, normative, metacognitive and contextual, and is the first study to use the BALLI in the context of war. Findings from this research provide a basis for future studies, which can help in creating more studentcentred foreign language classes and language programmes that take into account students' beliefs and context and help in adjusting their attitudes to enhance their autonomy, particularly in turbulent contexts. Also, findings from this research can help in designing English language teaching programmes that are not limited to the linguistic content but could prepare the students to engage actively with the world outside their classrooms.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Seen/believed: a practice-based study of depiction
within the photograph.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14377/","Mahon, M","October 2021","This practice-based study with accompanying body of work, addresses the question of how recognition and illusion, as well as viewers’ expectations, influence the reading of a photograph. It arose from Barthes’ comment about the ‘real unreality’ of the photograph, interpreted as expressing the conundrum that while the contemporary photograph may be an object or on screen, what it illustrates is not wholly accurate to what was once in front of the lens. (Barthes, 1977, p. 44). The study is explained in this document, outlining the trajectory and rationale behind the research, it describes all the studio work and notes contextual links to related works by other artists. The studio work, particularly those pieces presented at exhibition, are at the heart of the project. They are the visual enactment, the resolution and the new knowledge integral to the enquiry. The study investigated the question of what is seen/believed within the contemporary photograph, used within art practice, accepting that this may be on screen or paper. The topic was subdivided into an enquiry of the assumptions surrounding the accuracy of a photograph, the implications of staging within the photograph and the phenomenology of the paper photograph. Throughout there was an emphasis on first-hand research and critical reflection, annotated in sketch books. Relevant theoretical texts, which became interrelated objects of thinking, were by Roland Barthes, Lucy Soutter and David Campany, amongst others.  Initially the studio practice engaged with given strategies and tactics used by established 20th / 21st century practitioners, notably James Casebere and Thomas Demand because of their use of models specifically made to photograph. Early works made during the study were ‘in the style of..’, progressing to works using deliberate staging, resulting in finished pieces with photographs and objects. The study also includes extended experimentation with early process photography, notably cyanotypes, to extend ideas of phenomenology.  The studio work, in particular ""The Mugshots"" (2018), as well as first-hand research, demonstrated that contemporaneously the notion of what might constitute a photograph has been embellished and eroded. The author discusses the personal credibility of the photograph as object, suggesting that this lingers from the analogue, endowing a form of tacit knowledge. The study observes that definitions of the photograph are no longer adequate. Perhaps 'photographic' as an adjective is preferable to 'photograph' as a noun. Therefore, as well as questioning the actual compared to what is presented within a photograph, the study became concerned with finding a more appropriate definition of what constitutes a photograph. The author concludes that a photograph exists on paper or a screen and is made by the reaction of light emitted from an object, onto chemicals or a processor. The insistence on ‘light emitted from an object’ makes it different to an image, which may appear to be a photograph. The concluding work in the study ""Follow Me Lights"" (2020) holds the findings and excitement of the whole study as well as the physical enactment of the new knowledge. By examining the camera’s response to the phenomenon of light, and the happenstance of a fault in the camera’s processor, it shows a smudge (analogue) beside visible pixels (digital). The work disrupts all ideas of true/real/ accurate because of the introduction of contradiction and uncertainty. The conclusion is that the viewer reads what is presented dependant on context and their own expectation. The study has come full circle and the photograph remains enigmatic, echoing Barthes.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Understanding individual perception and experience of fear during mandatory quarantine: lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/15226/","Ofori, D.W; Antwi, J","February 2023","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has manifested differently across the globe in terms of its sociocultural and economic impacts. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed guidelines for the effective implementation of local or national quarantine protocols to quickly detect people who have been exposed to COVID-19 and separate them from others during the disease’s incubation period. This paper examines how Ghanaians perceive and experience fear under quarantine in the various designated quarantine centres (Pentecost Community Centre and Pram-pram Convention Centre).  Drawing on the interpretive inquiry lens, data were collected through phone/Skype interviews with six individuals who had been quarantined with experience to share. Interpretative Phenomenology Approach (IPA) for data analysis was used to interpret the views and experience of participants under quarantine and how that affected their well-being. Using the WHO quarantine guidelines, our analyses focused on an individual’s experience of fear under quarantine, offering an insight into what characterises their fear as well as exploring events, coping strategies and the implementation of standard quarantine protocols in the country.  The results showed that the quarantine protocols aligned with the WHO guidelines, albeit with some exceptions; these omissions partly compounded the fear experienced by those who were quarantined in the various centres. The results help to reveal the specific events that led to fear. For example, the fear of being infected by others at the quarantine centres, the unknown duration of the quarantine, the potential loss of lives and the uncertainty of recovery. The participants managed their fearful experiences and tension at the quarantine centres by coming together to pray every morning, share the word of God and engage in jokes. This paper contributes to issues of distinct emotions and individual viewpoints under mandatory quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic in a specific country context.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Neuroplasticity and crossmodal connectivity in the normal, healthy brain.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13909/","Karim, A.K.M.R; Proulx, M.J; de Sousa, A.A ; Likova, L.T","April 2021","Objective: Neuroplasticity enables the brain to establish new crossmodal connections or reorganize old connections which are essential to perceiving a multisensorial world. The intent of this review is to identify and summarize the current developments in neuroplasticity and crossmodal connectivity, and deepen understanding of how crossmodal connectivity develops in the normal, healthy brain, highlighting novel perspectives about the principles that guide this connectivity. Method: To this end, a narrative review is carried out. The data documented in prior relevant studies in neuroscience, psychology, and other related fields available in a wide range of prominent electronic databases are critically assessed, synthesized, interpreted with qualitative rather than quantitative elements, and linked together to form new propositions and hypotheses about neuroplasticity and crossmodal connectivity. Results: Three major themes are identified. First, it appears that neuroplasticity operates by following eight fundamental principles and crossmodal integration operates by following three principles. Second, two different forms of crossmodal connectivity, namely, direct crossmodal connectivity and indirect crossmodal connectivity, are suggested to operate in both unisensory and multisensory perception. Third, three principles possibly guide the development of crossmodal connectivity into adulthood. These are labeled as the principle of innate crossmodality, the principle of evolution-driven “neuromodular” reorganization and the principle of multimodal experience. These principles are combined to develop a three-factor interaction model of crossmodal connectivity. Conclusions: The hypothesized principles and the proposed model together advance understanding of neuroplasticity, the nature of crossmodal connectivity, and how such connectivity develops in the normal, healthy brain.","Ai","Bath Spa University"

The aim of this study was to compare cross-sectional data collected from HSC staff in the UK at two time points during the COVID-19 pandemic: Phase 1 (May–July 2020) and Phase 2 (November 2020–January 2021). The HSC staff surveyed consisted of nurses, midwives, allied health professionals, social care workers and social workers from across the UK (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland). Multiple regressions were used to examine the effects of different coping strategies and demographic and work-related variables on participants’ wellbeing and quality of working life to see how and if the predictors changed over time. An additional multiple regression was used to directly examine the effects of time (Phase 1 vs. Phase 2) on the outcome variables. Findings suggested that both wellbeing and quality of working life deteriorated from Phase 1 to Phase 2. The results have the potential to inform interventions for HSC staff during future waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, other infectious outbreaks or even other circumstances putting long-term pressures on HSC systems.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Unsettling play: perceptions of Agonistic Games.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14042/","De Angeli, D; Finnegan, D.J; Scott, L; O'Neill, E","May 2021","In this article, we propose Agonistic Games (AGs) as a serious games subcategory that can stimulate critical reflection on topics of dark heritage through multiperspectivity and unsettling play. We first discuss the emerging topic of agonism in memory studies, and then how games can be used to support its objectives. We then discuss the development of two original AGs: Endless Blitz and Umschlagplatz ’43. We explore whether these two AGs were perceived as capable of stimulating critical reflection by collecting data from visitors to the exhibition “Krieg. Macht. Sinn” at the Ruhr Museum in Germany where the games were installed, and from participants in an online course describing the games. From analysing data collected, we outline four factors inhibiting the capacity of AGs to stimulate critical reflection (topic, context, design, and assumptions about games) and propose strategies for overcoming these inhibitors. Our findings are valuable to scholars, game researchers, and designers, strengthening the foundations for the design and development of future AGs.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Pathways linking biodiversity to human health: a conceptual framework.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14000/","Marselle, M.R","April 2021","Biodiversity is a cornerstone of human health and well-being. However, while evidence of the contributions of nature to human health is rapidly building, research into how biodiversity relates to human health remains limited in important respects. In particular, a better mechanistic understanding of the range of pathways through which biodiversity can influence human health is needed. These pathways relate to both psychological and social processes as well as biophysical processes. Building on evidence from across the natural, social and health sciences, we present a conceptual framework organizing the pathways linking biodiversity to human health. Four domains of pathways—both beneficial as well as harmful—link biodiversity with human health: (i) reducing harm (e.g. provision of medicines, decreasing exposure to air and noise pollution); (ii) restoring capacities (e.g. attention restoration, stress reduction); (iii) building capacities (e.g. promoting physical activity, transcendent experiences); and (iv) causing harm (e.g. dangerous wildlife, zoonotic diseases, allergens). We discuss how to test components of the biodiversity-health framework with available analytical approaches and existing datasets. In a world with accelerating declines in biodiversity, profound land-use change, and an increase in non-communicable and zoonotic diseases globally, greater understanding of these pathways can reinforce biodiversity conservation as a strategy for the promotion of health for both people and nature. We conclude by identifying research avenues and recommendations for policy and practice to foster biodiversity-focused public health actions.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Leaf breakdown rates as a functional indicator were influenced by an invasive non-native invertebrate in urban ponds.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13687/","Thornhill, I; Friberg, N; Batty, L; Thamia, V; Ledger, M.E","January 2021","Impacts on biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems are often overlooked in small waterbodies as they are not regularly monitored as part of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). These small systems are, however, often essential for freshwater biodiversity and are frequently characterized by high beta-diversity. In this study we examined shredder diversity and ecosystem functioning (leaf litter breakdown) as indicators of environmental stress along a gradient of urbanisation. The native isopod Asellus aquaticus and the non-native shrimp Crangonyx pseudogracilis (Amphipoda) were dominant species of the shredder communities in 26 study ponds. Variation in shredder community composition among ponds was explained by pond surface area (P < 0.05) and the coverage of impermeable surface within 500 m (P < 0.05), indicative of urban impact, which was strongly, and negatively correlated with shredder richness. Site mean total leaf breakdown was 0.0020 k d−1 (range 0.0003 – 0.0053), whilst breakdown rates owing to microbial and fungal activity were lower and averaged 0.0010 k d−1 (range 6.72−5 − 0.0036). Both total and microbial activity driven breakdown rates showed relatively weak relationships with the environmental gradient reflecting degrees of urbanization. A model-averaging procedure suggested that total litter breakdown rates could be attributed to activity of shredders with A. aquaticus and C. pseudogracilis contributing most, explaining 65% of the variance (R2 = 0.65, F = 13.7, P < 0.001), which both significantly and similarly predicted total leaf breakdown rates (P < 0.05). Total leaf breakdown rates were significantly correlated with the densities of both C. pseudogracilis (P < 0.001) and A. aquaticus (P < 0.001), however partial correlations indicated that the former showed the strongest association.  The process of urbanisation can have significant, and negative impacts upon freshwater ecosystems, including small water bodies such as ponds both regarding biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The findings of the current study suggest that ecosystem functioning indicators such as leaf litter decomposition should be paired with structural measures. This is because function sustained by tolerant invading species would not otherwise be detected, and their presence is increasingly likely due to climate change and urbanization.","Ai","Bath Spa University"

Secondly, I will discuss my recent video work 'Notes from the Subsurface'(2020), made during my research fellowship in the Earth and Life Sciences Departments at Bristol University. I will argue that the use of these fictional methods can help to enhance the criticality and potency of sci/art collaboration, allowing for a shared co-enquiry to emerge and for the artwork to maintain its criticality. Finally, I will consider ways for building on these projects to enhance future sci/art interdisciplinary practice and to help foster new models for collaboration.","Ai","Bath Spa University"

However, access to post-secondary education is still extremelly challenging, especially for scientific areas. The under representation of people with visual impairment in the evolution research community is connected with the vision-based communication of evolutionary biology knowledge and the accompanying lack of multisensory alternatives for learning.  Results:-    Here, we describe the development of an inclusive outreach activity based on a multisensory phylogeny representing 20 taxonomic groups. We provide a tool kit of materials and ideas that allow both the replication of this activity and the adaptation of others, to include people with visual impairment. Furthermore, we provide activity evaluation data, a discussion of the lessons learned and an inclusive description of all figures and visual data presented.  The presented baseline data show that people with visual impairment indeed have lack of access to education but are interested in and apt to understand evolutionary biology concepts and predict evolutionary change when education is inclusive.  Conclusions:-    We show that, with creative investment, basic evolutionary knowledge is perfectly possible to be transmitted through multisensory activities, which everyone can benefit from. Ultimately, we hope this case study will provide a baseline for future initiatives and a more inclusive outreach community.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Exploring stakeholder perspectives on contemporary return-to work strategies and practices for chronic pain sufferers.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14349/","Wegrzynek, P","October 2021","Psychologically and physically safe work is good for the health and well-being of most people including those living with pain. Chronic pain remains the second biggest reason for work absence, and is economically and psychologically costly to employees, employers, and governments. This thesis investigates the most effective strategies in promoting return to work (RTW) among employees with ongoing pain.  Two reviews (one systematic, one narrative) found no conclusive evidence to support any treatment approach, although stratified, multidisciplinary interventions with workplace­oriented elements are optimal. Semi-structured interviews with employees with chronic pain (study one), occupational health physicians (study two), occupational therapists and occupational health nurses (study three) were analysed using thematic analysis.  In study one, employees with chronic pain felt motivated towards RTW and adopted an 'active' role in the process. Social support played a pivotal role, although workers felt pressured to be '100% fit' upon returning. Employees felt expert in their pain experience, entitled to ownership of their care decision-making, and acted as knowledge conduits between stakeholders.  In study two, occupational health physicians were frustrated with current RTW processes, perceived overworked GPs as unwitting saboteurs of RTW processes, and blamed systemic issues within the NHS and reduced resources for the lack of access to multidisciplinary interventions. Study three revealed that medicalisation of chronic pain hinders RTW, and primary RTW outcomes should be driven by workers' meaningful activity. Health professionals in study three adopt a protective role with pain clients, similar to the mentoring role suggested in study two.  The thesis' theoretical framework, revised in the light of the empirical analyses, retains the biopsychosocial model of pain and the Job Demands-Resources model, and suggests that a successful RTW strategy for workers with chronic pain should be multidisciplinary, consider patients' active roles, their need for support, and adopt a flexible approach to compensation. Implications for practice include extending who does sick-listing and examining volunteering as an occupational outcome.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
"Stitched up in the Conversengine: using expressive processing and multimodal languages to create a character-driven interactive digital narrative.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14344/","Wilks, C","October 2021","My practice-based research, which this thesis supports, explores the question: How can a convincing interactive character, with apparent psychological depth, be modelled in a playable digital narrative that adapts to reader choice? To this end I am building my own platform, the 'Conversengine', for authoring and, in future, publishing and playing text-driven interactive narratives that rely on enactment rather than narration. Currently, the platform consists of the 'Convowriter', the authoring tool, which I am using to develop 'Stitched Up', an interactive psychological thriller.   Using the concept of the black box from second-order cybernetics with possible worlds and theory of mind from narratology, I show how combining these theories, mapping one onto another, provides a framework for not only thinking about the character-driven interactive narrative, but also a methodology for authoring one, in both natural language and computer code, and designing its richly responsive visual interface. This incorporates a unique emotional data visualisation system ('emoviz') to dynamically represent interactive fictional characters. This system is built upon the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance Emotional State Model (Russell and Mehrabian, 1977) and informed by existing psychological research into colour, shape and motion. I contend that abstract visualisations, coupled with the characters' text-based thoughts and/or speech, can eloquently express convincing mental and emotional behaviour. This provides the feedback in my cybernetic 'steering-a-course' game engine, which, whilst maintaining narrative coherence, allows the reader-player to steer their own course through the narrative.   Creating an interactive narrative of this kind, which simulates psychological rather than physical action, requires a different approach to game writing, development and design. In part two of this thesis, I explore how the distinction between story and narrative discourse has practical implications for the creation of interactive digital narratives. I discuss how using existing game engines and tools can be limiting, and how this led to building my own interactive narrative engine with its own expressive domain-specific language. I show how the combined features of the 'Conversengine' offer a new way of representing complex interactive characters with psychological depth.","Ai","Bath Spa University"

"A case study exploring the impact of parental deployment on the wellbeing of British Army children in the pre-school year.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/14044/","Normile, G","May 2021","This thesis explores the wellbeing of three to four-year-old British Army children experiencing a parental deployment during their pre-school year. Despite a recent increase in interest of the deployment-related experiences of school-aged service children, the deployment-related wellbeing of pre-school children has been under researched in the British context and they remain overlooked in terms of educational, social and Armed Forces policy.This study also seeks to clarify the use of the conceptually vague term wellbeing in the context of service children’s research through a consideration of the multiple discourses of wellbeing and an exploration of the component domains of wellbeing. Drawing upon both the bioecological model of development and cultural historical theory, the study explored how individual, social and environmental factors impact upon the different domains of pre-school children’s wellbeing during a parental deployment. A case study design focusing on ten children experiencing a parental deployment was employed within an Army Garrison in England.In each case, the deployed parent was the father.Interviews were conducted with the ten non-deployed mothers and fourteen pre-school practitioners working with the children. Six of the pre-school children also took part in the study via participatory research methods and interviews. Analysis of the data identified four distinct but interlinked domains of wellbeing that were impacted by the father’s deployment; psychological, physical, social and cognitive. These are discussed in relation to how they are influenced by factors of the individual child, their social relationships and factors relating to their environments. The thesis concludes by discussing the implications of this research for British educational, social and Armed Forces policy and practice in terms of supporting the wellbeing of pre-school children during times of a parental deployment.","Ai","Bath Spa University"

Recent evidence suggests that each human has signature patterns of eye movements like handwriting which depend on their sensitivity, allocation of attention and experience. Use of implicit knowledge of how earth's gravity influences object motion has been shown to aid dynamic perception. We used a projected ball-tracking task with a plain background offering no context cues to probe the effect of acquired experience about physical laws of gravitation on performance differences of 44 participants under a simulated gravity and an atypical (upward) antigravity condition. Performance measured by the unsigned difference between instantaneous eye and stimulus positions (RMSE) was consistently worse in the antigravity condition. In the vertical RMSE, participants took about 200 ms longer to improve to the best performance for antigravity compared to gravity trials. The antigravity condition produced a divergence of individual performance which was correlated with levels of questionnaire-based quantified traits of schizotypy but not control traits. Grouping participants by high or low traits revealed a negative relationship between schizotypy trait level and both initiation and maintenance of tracking, a result consistent with trait-related impoverished sensory prediction. The findings confirm for the first time that where cues enabling exact estimation of acceleration are unavailable, knowledge of gravity contributes to dynamic prediction improving motion processing. With acceleration expectations violated, we demonstrate that antigravity tracking could act as a multivariate diagnostic window into predictive brain function.","Ai","Bath Spa University"
