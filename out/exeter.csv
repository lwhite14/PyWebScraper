"Venture capital, credit, and FinTech start-up formation: A cross-country study ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/123428","Kolokas, D; Vanacker, T; Veredas, D; et al.","November 2020","Growing FinTech entrepreneurship is a recent global phenomenon. Drawing on the national innovation systems framework, we examine how countries’ venture capital (VC) and credit markets differently affect FinTech entrepreneurship across countries. We argue that with their established and globally diffused norms and practices, VC investors—but not banks—require a critical mass of FinTech entrepreneurship in a country to more positively influence FinTech entrepreneurship. Moreover, we argue that VC and credit markets are substitutes, especially in countries with more FinTech entrepreneurship. Using quantile regressions on data from 53 countries, we find support for our hypotheses.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Putting an End to Song: Penelope, Odysseus and the Teleologies of the Odyssey ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/39101","Hauser, E","October 2020","Book 1 of the Odyssey presents us with the first bard-figure of the poem, singing what in many ways is an analogue to the Odyssey with “the return of the Greeks”; yet when Penelope appears, it is to attempt to put an end to his song. I use this scene as a starting point to suggest that Penelope is deeply implicated in narrative endings in the Odyssey. Looking at the end or τέλος of the poem through a systematic study of its “closural allusions,” I argue that a teleological analysis of Penelope’s character in relation to endings may both resolve some of the issues in her interpretation thus far, and open up new avenues for the reading of the Odyssey as a poem informed by endings.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Influence of blockchain technology in SME internationalization: Evidence from high-tech SMEs in India ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/129062","Rakshit, S; Islam, N; Mondal, S; et al.","March 2022","This study examines the impact of blockchain technology (BCT) on small and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs) internationalization. Further, it examines how Amazon as a platform reframes the global partnership environment via the BCT network that enables Indian SMEs to operate globally. Data were collected from 291 employees at 43 high-tech SMEs in India. They revealed untapped interest in how Indian SMEs will use Amazon for global operations. Several factors, such as processes to strategize, synergize, and standardize, are described as needing to be addressed before SMEs can boost integrated business efficiency, especially with regards to marketing capacity, scale, scope, and financial performance. The study represents a critical theoretical contribution to Amazon-based global operations by developing the 3S Triangle Model, which could provide a basis for future business practice. Furthermore, the study defines and addresses the evolution of BCT that Amazon has used—and continues to use—as a global operations platform. At the convergence of BCT, Amazon, and global retail activities, we propose and advance an integrated model of BCT-driven global operations among SMEs that provides a holistic view of state-of-the-art practices and exciting avenues for future study.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"'Ten in a Bed': Literacy, Intermediality and the Potentials of Low-Tech ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/19743","Beswick, K","June 2016","Ten in Bed was a project led by participatory arts organisation Phakama, in partnership with Queen Mary University of London. Over an eight-week period we ran a series of intermedial arts workshops and staged a performance with under-5s and their families at a community centre in Bethnal Green, London. We attempted to enhance creative and communication skills, which are a key feature of critical literacy. In this article, I use Lars Elleström’s ‘modalities’ to parse the project’s material, perceptual and social aspects and to consider the ways in which the intermedial process operated affectively to develop critical literacy skills.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Institutional transition and the financing of high tech SMEs in China: a longitudinal perspective ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/9702","Xiao, Li; North, David","June 2011","This paper examines changes in Chinese high-tech SMEs' access to both bank and informal finance in response to the institutional changes relating to the private sector and financial transactions.Using a theoretical framework based on institutional theory, the paper distinguishes between changes at different institutional levels and between formal and informal institutional arrangements as they relate to the availability of business finance during the period covered by China's economic reforms. The empirical evidence provides a longitudinal perspective by drawing upon the findings from two rounds of face to face interviews with the owners of high-tech SMEs and finance providers in the Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi covering two sequential time periods: from the early 1990s to 2004 and then from 2004 to 2009. The findings show that the responses of high-tech SMEs and informal investors to the institutional changes have been more positive compared with those of banks. Consequently, access to informal sources of finance has grown, including to longer term equity finance, whereas that to bank finance has not significantly improved. The paper demonstrates that the effects of the overall institutional framework on the optimal selection of formal and informal arrangements to secure funding differ between types of finance provider and are not necessarily positively associated with the phases of the institutional transitions.","Tech","University of Exeter"

"Complexities in Inter-firm R&D Collaborative Partnerships in High-Tech Industries: Innovation and Financial Performances ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/35498","Amona, TD","January 2019","Governments in both advanced and emerging markets invest heavily into joint R&D projects to facilitate inter-firm collaboration and scientific productivity. As a science-based cluster, nanotechnology is a highly R&D-intensive field with very complex interdisciplinary features that enables multiple interactions between scientists from diverse cultural backgrounds working for multi-faceted organizations across public and private sectors and through internationally regulated borders. In this thesis, I examine the main determinants of the dimensions of inter-firm collaboration in high-tech industries particularly among nanotechnology R&D organisations across Europe. Also, I investigate the key factors that influence the innovation, financial and exit performance of nanotech companies during the commercialisation period and across 15 developed and developing countries, taking into consideration the involvement of venture capital (VC) firms. In order to methodically integrate the qualitative and quantitative features of my research study, I employed mixed method to analyse primary and secondary data collected via survey instruments and comprehensive databases; to gain valuable insights into the complexities around nanotech R&D organisations. The regression results show that a predictable legal system; a high level of tolerance for uncertainty; the proximity to key partners; a high level of export demand for high-tech products; and expansionary economic policies, leads to highly valuable and long-term relationships which produces optimal partnership size with an effective organizational structure. I find that a high financial status of nanotech firms equips R&D project managers with sufficient tangible and intangible resources to engage into complex collaborative partnerships which yield innovative performing outcomes. Also, I find that nanotech R&D firms that exit venture capital investments via IPO are more likely to have their head offices in a big city; and access foreign capital to expand manufacturing operations. I conclude that the successful commercialisation of nanotechnology industries across the globe has been due to the substantial R&D public expenditures and private investments into the application and proliferation of nanotechnologies in key converging scientific fields which require robust inter-firm collaborative partnerships to rapidly develop and promote several portfolios of high-tech products that continually satisfy consumer needs in disruptive ways and secure long-term profitability for nanotech R&D organisations.","Tech","University of Exeter"

Thus far, narratives of agriculture 4.0 have been predominately framed in terms of benefits to productivity and the environment with little attention placed on social sustainability. This is despite the fact that agriculture 4.0 has significant social implications, both potentially positive and negative. Our viewpoint highlights the need to incorporate social sustainability (or simply ‘people’) into technological trajectories and we outline a framework of multi-actor co-innovation to guide responsible socio-technical transitions. Through the greater inclusion of people in agricultural innovation systems guided by responsible innovation principles, we can increase the likelihood of this technology revolution achieving social sustainability alongside benefiting production and the environment.","Tech","University of Exeter"

"Rapid high-resolution mid-IR imaging for molecular spectral histopathological diagnosis of oesophageal cancers ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/36830","Hermes, M","April 2019","This thesis is written as part of Marie-Curie international training network called Mid-TECH. Mid-TECH is devoted to improve mid-infrared (MIR) technologies and consists of 15 PhD projects across European universities. This thesis aims to evaluate new technologies and concepts developed by the project partners for their applicability in a biomedical setting. The clinical problem to diagnose oesophageal cancers serves as an example case for this. The thesis consists of three projects all aimed to further the understanding of MIR hyperspectral imaging. The first project discussed in chapter 5 demonstrates the use of an new design of the United States Airforce resolution test chart. The new test chart is developed to evaluate spatial resolution of MIR hyperspectral imaging systems. The use of different materials is discussed and the new iteration of the thes chart is evaluated using a state of the art MIR imaging system. The second project discussed in chapter 6 evaluates the technical differences and their practical implications of discrete frequency MIR imaging systems compared to continuum source systems. A comparison of the two system types is drawn for imaging paraffin embedded sections of oesophageal tissue. Furthermore the effect of chemically removing the paraffin from the sample is compared to a mathematical correction algorithm. The system performance is compared based on their ability to differentiate healthy from cancerous tissue. The third project discussed in chapter 7 evaluates the potential of a new MIR detection scheme called upconversion in combination with a novel MIR laser source. It is a prove of concept study demonstrating that those two technologies can be deployed to do hyperspectral imaging in the MIR.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"An Examination of the determinants of entrepreneurship in Thai high technology start-ups ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/38831","Binnui, A","September 2019","This study advances understanding of the complexity of sustaining growth in high technology-based businesses. The study builds on the conceptual and applied insights on business growth from the entrepreneurship literatures to develop a model. The model is developed to investigate the impact of determinants subsumed under the three key-based factors, entrepreneurship, innovation and firm growth dynamics on the firms’ innovative entrepreneurial activities that might lead to enhanced economic growth This thesis uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to describe the determinants and test the relationships. The quantitative survey collected data from 521 young Thai start-ups. The qualitative study involved interviews with the CEO/owners of seven high-tech firms in Thailand. The quantitative and qualitative evidence from these firms led to a much stronger explanation of the performance of the high-tech sample. This thesis has significant theoretical and practical implications. From a theoretical viewpoint, this study provides detailed evaluation on the growth determinants from a developing country perspective. The results shown that the young high-technology firms in Thailand were similar to firms that had been examined in the literature with regard to their characteristics, innovation and firm growth dynamics but differed with regard to the utilisation of the key firm based factors subsumed under the three key-based factors, entrepreneurship, innovation and firm growth dynamics. From a practical viewpoint, these findings indicate that the competitiveness of young technology-based firms can be enhanced by developing critical capabilities to assist the right strategies for better performance. The thesis provides important new insights into this group of firms in a developing country. The analysis of the empirical and qualitative results showed the role and impacts of the determinants on the firms’ sustainable growth and highlighted the importance of the managerial ability to dynamically manipulate these key firm based determinants to sustain growth.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Initial Coin Offerings as a new method of raising funds: Risks, Challenges, and Policy Recommendation ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/133290","Yildiz, Y","June 2023","Abstract  An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a new method of finance raising for entrepreneurs underpinned with Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). ICOs have the potential to address some of the most critical priorities for financial sector development through reducing barriers for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in accessing finance and by expanding opportunities for consumer finance and increasing competition in financial services. The main objective of this thesis is to carry out a detailed examination of ICOs in order to answer the following questions: Why should ICOs be regulated, and what kinds of regulation should be used? The issues and challenges of ICOs have been examined in the light of current regulations and case law, including policy papers and reports published by relevant official legislative bodies regarding ICOs and cryptoassets. Based on the findings of this thesis, the proposal is not the replacement of traditional financial methods with ICOs; on the contrary, it is proposed that ICOs should be regulated as a new method within the financial ecosystem to facilitate access to finance and increase financial inclusion. The regulation of ICOs is not only a necessity for ensuring market integrity, but it can also provide a transparent, reliable, healthy, and protected investment environment for participants, prevent fraudulent activities, and address the risk of capital losses with respect to ICOs. In addition, not only are ICOs assessed from a broader legal perspective, but critical legal challenges related to ICOs, such as Smart Contracts, Code as Law, Securities Token Offerings, Non-Fungible Tokens or Tokenisation of Securities have also been examined legally in detail. From this perspective, the aim of this research is to examine ICOs comprehensively in terms of the possible risks, advantages and challenges, to pursue the possibility of regulating ICOs, and to recommend a proper policy for this innovative method in accordance with its unique structure. The aim of the part on policy recommendation is to find innovative solutions to overcome the limitations in terms of regulation and supervision. The focus of this study has been on discussions regarding regulatory theories as risk-based or outcome-based regulation, regulatory innovations that include regulatory sandboxes, innovation offices, and the role of Regulatory Technologies (RegTech) and Supervisory Technologies (SupTech) programs that aim to automate supervisory and compliance processes scrutinising the role for these kinds of innovations in future regulations.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"On the accuracy of aerosol photoacoustic spectrometer calibrations using absorption by ozone ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/33105","Davies, NW; Cotterell, MI; Fox, C; et al.","April 2018","In recent years, photoacoustic spectroscopy has emerged as an invaluable tool for the accurate measurement of light absorption by atmospheric aerosol. Photoacoustic instruments require calibration, which can be achieved by measuring the photoacoustic signal generated by known quantities of gaseous ozone. Recent work has questioned the validity of this approach at short visible wavelengths (404 nm), indicating systematic calibration errors of the order of a factor of 2. We revisit this result and test the validity of the ozone calibration method using a suite of multipass photoacoustic cells operating at wavelengths 405, 514 and 658 nm. Using aerosolised nigrosin with mobility-selected diameters in the range 250-425 nm, we demonstrate excellent agreement between measured and modelled ensemble absorption cross sections at all wavelengths, thus demonstrating the validity of the ozone-based calibration method for aerosol photoacoustic spectroscopy at visible wavelengths.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Challenges in geological scientific fieldwork at the Kaiserstuhl carbonatite, Germany ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/131231","Speiser, A; Smith, K; Wall, F; et al.","November 2018","This report describes the challenges experienced during the geological scientific fieldwork at the Kaiserstuhl, Germany. Although the general perception of the public regarding the project is positive, the Municipality of Vogtsburg would have allowed the proposed ca. 400 m deep core drilling only if the HiTech AlkCarb project had taken an insurance policy for any potential environmental and social damage for the longest possible period after the drilling. This caution was the result of damage to buildings in the local town of Staufen im Breisgau and induced seismicity near Basel during geothermal energy projects. As it was not possible to obtain such an insurance, the drilling programme had to be abandoned. A company with an official exploration licence would have had the right to drill, although the lack of social licence for drilling may make an exploration licence hard to obtain in the region at the moment. Moreover, if the drilling programme had been contracted by a German governmental institution, such as a university or the geological survey, the drilling could have been carried out, as governmental institutions in Germany are automatically insured through the state. However, the local university HiTech AlkCarb project partner declined to take over running the drilling contract, and this probably reflects the perceived reputational risk of taking part in any drilling in the region at the moment. It is a good lesson in how damage to social licence can affect permitting. The recommendations to the European Commission arising from this experience are: • To assign any drilling in research and innovation projects, in Germany, and probably elsewhere in Europe, to a Government organisation where possible. • To publicise good practice examples and subsurface research projects (such as UK GEOS and similar) that can help to regain public confidence.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"A high-tech, low-cost, Internet of Things surfboard fin for coastal citizen science, outreach, and education ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/129583","Bresnahan, P; Cyronak, T; Brewin, RJW; et al.","April 2022","Coastal populations and hazards are escalating simultaneously, leading to an increased importance of coastal ocean observations. Many well-established observational techniques are expensive, require complex technical training, and offer little to no public engagement. Smartfin, an oceanographic sensor–equipped surfboard fin and citizen science program, was designed to alleviate these issues. Smartfins are typically used by surfers and paddlers in surf zone and nearshore regions where they can help fill gaps between other observational assets. Smartfin user groups can provide data-rich time-series in confined regions. Smartfin comprises temperature, motion, and wet/dry sensing, GPS location, and cellular data transmission capabilities for the near-real-time monitoring of coastal physics and environmental parameters. Smartfin's temperature sensor has an accuracy of 0.05 °C relative to a calibrated Sea-Bird temperature sensor. Data products for quantifying ocean physics from the motion sensor and additional sensors for water quality monitoring are in development. Over 300 Smartfins have been distributed around the world and have been in use for up to five years. The technology has been proven to be a useful scientific research tool in the coastal ocean—especially for observing spatiotemporal variability, validating remotely sensed data, and characterizing surface water depth profiles when combined with other tools—and the project has yielded promising results in terms of formal and informal education and community engagement in coastal health issues with broad international reach. In this article, we describe the technology, the citizen science project design, and the results in terms of natural and social science analyses. We also discuss progress toward our outreach, education, and scientific goals.","Tech","University of Exeter"

"The rare earth elements: demand, global resources, and challenges for resourcing future generations ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/27214","Goodenough, KM; Wall, F; Merriman, D","April 2017","The rare earth elements (REE) have attracted much attention in recent years, being viewed as critical metals because of China’s domination of their supply chain. This is despite the fact that REE enrichments are known to exist in a wide range of settings, and have been the subject of much recent exploration. Although the REE are often referred to as a single group, in practice each individual element has a specific set of end-uses, and so demand varies between them. Future demand growth to 2026 is likely to be mainly linked to the use of NdFeB magnets, particularly in hybrid and electric vehicles and wind turbines, and in erbium-doped glass fiber for communications. Supply of lanthanum and cerium is forecast to exceed demand. There are several different types of natural (primary) REE resources, including those formed by high-temperature geological processes (carbonatites, alkaline rocks, vein and skarn deposits) and those formed by low-temperature processes (placers, laterites, bauxites and ion-adsorption clays). In this paper, we consider the balance of the individual REE in each deposit type and how that matches demand, and look at some of the issues associated with developing these deposits. This assessment and overview indicate that while each type of REE deposit has different advantages and disadvantages, light rare earth-enriched ion adsorption types appear to have the best match to future REE needs. Production of REE as by-products from, for example, bauxite or phosphate, is potentially the most rapid way to produce additional REE. There are still significant technical and economic challenges to be overcome to create substantial REE supply chains outside China.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Geometallurgical evaluation of metals recovery from Kupferschiefer ore ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/121790","Pazik, P","June 2020","Cobalt is the 33rd element in terms of prevalence in the Earth’s crust, with an average concentration around 20 ppm (Nordberg et al., 2015). Due to its heat resistance, strength and magnetic properties, cobalt has a wide variety of applications in which its use has advantages over other elements. Since 2014, cobalt has been identified as a strategic metal by the European Union. It is also classified as an E-tech element by the UK National Environmental Research Council (NERC), which indicates that this element is essential for technological development. Although almost all cobalt used in the EU is imported, the Polish Kupferschiefer deposit is recognised as the most significant potential source of cobalt in Europe. To date, cobalt is not recovered from this resource (Report on Critical Raw Materials for EU, 2014), a consequence of the relatively modest enrichment of cobalt. In this study, a geometallurgical analysis of ore extraction from the Kupferschiefer deposit was made. Emphasis was placed on identifying opportunities – and barriers – for by-product recovery of cobalt from the deposit.","Tech","University of Exeter"

"Distributed ledger technologies (blockchain) in capital markets: risk and governance ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/33301","Lee, J","May 2018","Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) have the potential to revolutionise securities trading and the capital market through removing reconciliation and other costs that are no longer needed with the trust and transparency that DLT brings. DLTs have been used to create virtual currencies (crypto-currencies), such as Bitcoin and Ether, and to create an alternative financial services system. DLTs are an innovation that can facilitate peer-to-peer trading, bringing about the democratisation of financial services markets. This promise is based on the assumption that the functionality of DLTs will result in two changes: decentralisation and disintermediation. To this end, the author investigates how DLT can be applied to the entire life cycle of securities trading – listing (issuing), trading, clearing, and settlement – currently operated by financial market infrastructure (FMI) providers. This paper attempts to answer the following questions: will DLT bring about the benefits it promises? Will decentralisation increase market risks? Will disintermediation create more obstacles to securities trading? In particular, this paper will assess securities trading on DLT networks against systemic risk, market conduct risk, and operational risk to the capital market and consider the appropriate regulations to enhance market integrity, operational safety and investor protection.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"In search of the forgotten rare earth ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/34997","Siegfried, P; Wall, F; Moore, K","November 2018","Scandium (Sc) has been called a ‘miracle metal’. When alloyed with aluminium, it produces super-strong but lightweight materials, just right for use in the next generation of aeroplane manufacture and other high-tech applications. By definition, Sc is a member of the 17-strong, rare earth element (REE) family. Like the other REEs, Sc isn’t actually rare in terms of distribution—it can be found throughout Earth’s crust and has a similar abundance to lead—but unlike lead, economic concentrations of Sc are very rare, making it one of the most expensive elements in the world. Indeed, concentrations of Sc are usually so low that Sc is often excluded from geological assessments of REE—it is the forgotten rare earth.  But this may be about to change. Several research groups are turning their attention to Sc, using new data from exploration projects to identify a number of promising sources that could be mined. Here we discuss the behaviour of Sc and the distribution of these deposits worldwide. We argue that with improved understanding of how Sc associates with clinopyroxene and how it concentrates within weathering and waste products, such as laterites and red muds, these newly identified deposits could create a virtuous circle of raw materials supply and new high-tech uses.","Tech","University of Exeter"

Recent progress in elastography techniques allows access to non-invasive measurement of cervical IVD in adults; the aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and reliability of shear wave elastography in healthy children lumbar IVD. METHODS: Elastography measurements were performed in 31 healthy children (6-17 years old), in the annulus fibrosus and in the transverse plane of L5-S1 or L4-L5 IVD. Reliability was determined by three experienced operators repeating measurements. RESULTS: Average shear wave speed in IVD was 2.9 ± 0.5 m/s; no significant correlations were observed with sex, age or body morphology. Intra-operator repeatability was 5.0 % while inter-operator reproducibility was 6.2 %. Intraclass correlation coefficient was higher than 0.9 for each operator. CONCLUSIONS: Feasibility and reliability of IVD shear wave elastography were demonstrated. The measurement protocol is compatible with clinical routine and the results show the method's potential to give an insight into spine deformity progression and early detection. KEY POINTS: • Intervertebral disc mechanical properties are key to spine biomechanics • Feasibility of shear wave elastography in children lumbar disc was assessed • Measurement was fast and reliable • Elastography could represent a novel biomarker for spine pathologies.","Tech","University of Exeter"

These theoretical conjectures are tested using a dataset of all tire producers worldwide between 1985 and 1996 that combines detailed firm data on establishment, patenting, and alliance activities. The results indicate that complementarity in terms of corporate and technological diversification strategies, as well as partner characteristics (e.g., size, age, and technological capabilities) drive exploitation alliances. Moreover, firms with similar product portfolios are more likely to engage in exploitative interactions. In contrast, exploration alliances exhibit strong partner similarity across all firm characteristics. Both corporate and technological diversification have positive effects on firms' propensity to engage in exploration, while technological distance has a negative nonlinear one.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Sorption and fractionation of rare earth element ions onto nanoscale zerovalent iron particles ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/32466","Crane, RA; Sapsford, DJ","March 2018","The removal behaviour of rare earth element (REE), (Sc, Y, La-Lu), ions onto nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) particles has been investigated. Batch sorption isotherms were conducted using REE-bearing acid mine drainage (AMD) and a range of different synthetic REE solutions, which were exposed to nZVI at 0.1–4.0 g/L. Maximum adsorption capacity of Yb and La was 410 and 61 mg/g respectively (1000 mg/L LaCl 3 and YbCl 3 starting concentration, initial pH = 4.5, T = 294 K), the highest currently reported in the literature. Aqueous REE removal to ultratrace concentrations ( < 1 µg/L, > 99.9% removal) was also recorded after 30 min (the first sampling interval) exposure of ≥0.5 g/L nZVI to 10 mg/L aqueous REE solutions (nitrate counterion). Similar rapidity and near-total removal ability was recorded for the exposure of nZVI to the AMD, however, a greater nZVI concentration was required, with the removal of all REEs (with the exception of La, Ce, Nd and Gd) to < 1 µg/L when exposed to nZVI at 4.0 g/L for 30 min. In all systems nZVI was selective for the removal of HREE ions in preference to LREE ions, with the mechanism determined using HRTEM-EDS and XPS analysis as via surface mediated precipitation. Overall the results demonstrate nZVI as exhibiting great promise as an effective and versatile agent for simultaneous REE ion recovery and fractionation.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Sea Based Container Culture (SBCC) hydrodynamic design assessment for European lobsters (Homarus gammarus) ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/23187","Halswell, P; Daniels, C; Johanning, L","August 2016","The presented work describes the hydrodynamic assessment studies of a much needed technical innovation of Sea Based Container Culture (SBCC) as part of a semi intensive, passive aquaculture culture system for farming the European lobster (Homarus gammarus). Factors that are known to influence growth and survival rates were obtained from previous literature, including flow rate, wave energy and motion characteristics; these factors defined performance criteria for SBCC containers. The internal flow velocities and external flow patterns for different SBCC container designs were measured and used to inform design decisions. Suitable graphical representations have been developed to assess SBCC containers on specific performance criteria. Oyster SBCC containers were found to provide stable motion characteristics but perform poorly against the lower velocity limit, indicating insufficient supply of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) to allow for optimal growth of European lobsters. Internal flow velocities were also measured on un-fouled and fouled SBCC containers; results showed SBCC 2 would not provide enough DO with 66% biofouling coverage (66% biofouling replicates one year deployment) and triggered a redesign. SBCC 1 at 90° yaw angle of attack demonstrated all round good performance against upper and lower velocity limits and motion characteristics; thus showed greatest promise for cultivation of European Lobster.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"The Effectiveness of Government Policies on Technology-based SMEs and Entrepreneurship:  A case study of the technology-based SMEs in Beijing, China ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/25475","Chen, Meiying","November 2016","The increasingly significant role played by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurship in national economies has attracted growing attention. Recent trends have increasingly emphasised the value of knowledge. The challenge within the 21st century is the importance of the productivity of service and knowledgeable workers, as well as strategic flexibility and innovation. It is suggested that high level of innovation, R&D and productivity are positively related. Technology-based SMEs are specifically selected as the object of this thesis since they exhibit most of the characteristics of the three terms, “SMEs”, “innovation” and “entrepreneurship”. SMEs may come across significant constraints because of their own limitations, such as financial constraints, human capital shortages, and weak market power. These constraints are even more serious for technology-based SMEs due to their industrial nature. As a consequence, technology-based SMEs tend to have a higher failure rate than non-tech SMEs and large firms. However, the benefits brought by them cannot be neglected. For example, the return of R&D on a social level is higher than the private level, which highlights the importance of technology-based SMEs for national development. Therefore, it motivates governments to increase support for technology-based SMEs.  This thesis aims to examine the effectiveness of government policies on technology-based SMEs and entrepreneurship in Beijing, China. Some researchers have studied and examined the policies, but mainly focussed on the description of policy frameworks and policy dynamics. There is a lack of studies examining the effectiveness of policies from the perspective of entrepreneurs in this context. This thesis fills this gap.    This thesis makes both a theoretical and methodological contribution to the entrepreneurship studies literature through the holistic case study approach. A mixed-method approach of document analysis, interview and a questionnaire are used to understand the interaction between policies and technology entrepreneurs. The key findings of this thesis are that policies have strong positive effects on the promotion of entrepreneurship and SMEs. But there are still some negative points when implementing policies, such as uneven filter criteria and supervision system between new and established firms.","Tech","University of Exeter"

"Prediction of automated sorter performance utilising a Monte Carlo simulation of feed characteristics ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/19337","Pascoe, Richard; Fitzpatrick, Robert S.; Garratt, Rose","March 2015","To evaluate the performance of an automated sorter typically requires testing of the material to be separated on a full-scale device.  In many cases limitations on the quantity of material available for testing, and the costs of the test programme, may limit the range of operating conditions examined.  In this paper we propose a method for prediction of automated sorter performance, based on material and machine characteristics, which can be used to evaluate how changes to these characteristics affect performance.  The distribution of particles at the point of identification is a key parameter in determining sorter efficiency.  A Monte Carlo simulation was used to predict the position of particles on a feed conveyor used to deliver particles to the identification zone.  The results produced show that this technique can be used to simulate the particle distribution achieved by an operating automated sorter (TiTech Combisense).    Sorter efficiency depends on firstly accurate identification of the target product (typically deflected) and secondly the precision of selective deflection, using compressed air jets or mechanical actuators.  A reduction of deflection efficiency is generally caused by the co-deflection of “non-target” particles resulting from their close proximity to particles being deflected.  In order to fine tune the sorter model data from automated sorting experiments were analysed to provide information on deflection efficiency over a wide range of operating conditions. The sorter model developed for the -10+6 mm size fraction was shown to provide a realistic prediction for coarser (-15+10 mm) particles.  The sorter model was used to demonstrate that sorter performance could be significantly improved by improved particle feed distribution.  When a high separation efficiency is required for a sorting application a 3 stage process was predicted to have a higher separation efficiency than a single stage process using the same number of sorters.","Tech","University of Exeter"

"Comparison of two closed-path cavity-based spectrometers for measuring air-water CO2 and CH4 fluxes by eddy covariance ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/36511","Yang, M; Prytherch, J; Kozlova, E; et al.","November 2016","In recent years several commercialised closed-path cavity-based spectroscopic instruments designed for eddy covariance flux measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and water vapour (H2O) have become available. Here we compare the performance of two leading models - the Picarro G2311-f and the Los Gatos Research (LGR) Fast Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (FGGA) at a coastal site. Both instruments can compute dry mixing ratios of CO2 and CH4 based on concurrently measured H2O, temperature, and pressure. Additionally, we used a high throughput Nafion dryer to physically remove H2O from the Picarro airstream. Observed air-sea CO2 and CH4 fluxes from these two analysers, averaging about 12 and 0.12 mmol m-2 day-1 respectively, agree within the measurement uncertainties. For the purpose of quantifying dry CO2 and CH4 fluxes downstream of a long inlet, the numerical H2O corrections appear to be reasonably effective and lead to results that are comparable to physical removal of H2O with a Nafion dryer in the mean. We estimate the high-frequency attenuation of fluxes in our closed-path set-up, which was relatively small (≤ 10 %) for CO2 and CH4 but very large for the more polar H2O. The Picarro showed significantly lower noise and flux detection limits than the LGR. The hourly flux detection limit for the Picarro was about 2 mmol m-2 day-1 for CO2 and 0.02 mmol m-2 day-1 for CH4. For the LGR these detection limits were about 8 and 0.05 mmol m-2 day-1. Using global maps of monthly mean air-sea CO2 flux as reference, we estimate that the Picarro and LGR can resolve hourly CO2 fluxes from roughly 40 and 4 % of the world's oceans respectively. Averaging over longer timescales would be required in regions with smaller fluxes. Hourly flux detection limits of CH4 from both instruments are generally higher than the expected emissions from the open ocean, though the signal to noise of this measurement may improve closer to the coast.","Tech","University of Exeter"

Leveraging large-scale pre-trained graph knowledge databases to support engineering design-related natural language processing (NLP) tasks has attracted a growing interest in the engineering design research community. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a survey of the state-of-the-art semantic networks for engineering design and propositions of future research to build and utilize large-scale semantic networks as knowledge bases to support engineering design research and practice. The survey shows that WordNet, ConceptNet and other semantic networks, which contain common-sense knowledge or are trained on non-engineering data sources, are primarily used by engineering design researchers to develop methods and tools. Meanwhile, there are emerging efforts in constructing engineering and technical-contextualized semantic network databases, such as B-Link and TechNet, through retrieving data from technical data sources and employing unsupervised machine learning approaches. On this basis, we recommend six strategic future research directions to advance the development and uses of large-scale semantic networks for artificial intelligence applications in engineering design.","Tech","University of Exeter"

"Smart Recovery of Cobalt as a By-Product of Primary Copper Extraction: Geometallurgical ore-type classification using FTIR spectroscopy ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/34774","Dehaine, Q; Tijsseling, L; Glass, HJ","April 2018","Cobalt is a transition metal whose physico-chemical properties make it a critical component in many tech applications, including high-strength alloys, magnets, rechargeable batteries used in electric cars, wind energy turbines, and energy storage systems. Cobalt is recovered as a by-product from extraction of nickel and/or copper ore. The largest cobalt output is derived from copper sediment-hosted deposits in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Efficient co-recovery of cobalt is challenging because the ratios of copper and cobalt within the deposit is variable. In addition, differences in mineralogy and texture are observed which imply that a fixed extraction process is not optimal for the entire deposit. In order to stabilise the mining value chain and optimize plant performance, comprehensive understanding of ore properties and geometallurgical factors which influence process performance is mandatory. Relevant ore properties depend on the processing options available (gravity, flotation, leaching) and the type of product considered (cobalt salt or metal). These properties can, in turn, be used to classify the resources by defining ore-types which are suited for a given processing route. To obtain insight into the spatial distribution of relevant properties and build a 3D geometallurgical model, it is necessary to develop techniques that have potential to measure properties rapidly and, preferably, within the mine. We have investigated the application of portable Fourier Transformed InfraRed (FTIR) to quantify the modal mineralogy of drillcore samples which are representative of the sulphide zone within a DRC Cu-Co deposit. Results were validated using QEMSCAN analysis. Prediction of gangue and target mineral grades was achieved using multivariate data analysis of the FTIR spectra through Partial Least Squares Regression. It is shown that the modal mineralogy obtained from FTIR can be used to classify ore types according to the type of copper-cobalt mineralization, copper-cobalt mineral grades, and gangue mineralogy. When the resulting geometallurgical model of the deposit is integrated into the mine planning process, the recovery of copper and cobalt can be optimized.","Tech","University of Exeter"

"Investigating marine citizenship and its role in creating good marine environmental health ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/126112","Buchan, PM","June 2021","The negative anthropogenic impacts upon the world ocean are accelerating. Marine citizenship has been proposed as a policy channel to work at an individual level of responsibility to improve marine environmental health and contribute to the achievement of a sustainable future. This interdisciplinary research reflects the principles of post-normal science, through its epistemologically pragmatic and pluralist approach to broadening our understanding of marine citizenship. Drawing on environmental psychology, human geography, environmental law, green political theory, and sociology, this research considers marine citizenship according to four key research questions: i) What is marine citizenship and who participates in it? ii) How are institutional policy frameworks of marine citizenship understood, interpreted and experienced by participants? iii) How do motivational and value-based factors influence marine citizenship choices? And iv) How do place-related factors influence the practice of marine citizenship? Mixed methods were used to bring together a range of data and maximise their thesis contribution. The research design consisted of an online survey of active marine citizens reached via three case studies: two community marine groups and one national citizen science project. This was followed by ethnographic observation of marine citizenship in practice and open-ended interview of purposively selected participants, to maximise insight into diversity of marine citizens and gain in-depth qualitative data. The results provide a number of novel insights into the conception and motivation of marine citizenship. In my research, prevailing interpretations of marine citizenship as a set of pro-environmental behaviours are extended by situating the concept within citizenship theory. Here I give additional focus to the understanding of marine citizenship as the right to construct and transform society’s relationship with the ocean, and how public participation in marine decision-making is perceived as being under-served by legislation and procedure. My data show that marine citizenship is influenced by a complex of interacting variables and that there is no one kind of person who becomes a marine citizen. Yet environmental identity, stimulation and conformity basic human values, climate change concern, place attachment and, in particular, place dependency are important factors for ‘thicker’ marine citizenship. The research uncovered a human affinity with the ocean through unique marine place attachment, which I call thalassophilia. These findings challenge normative approaches to pro-environmental behaviour, which frequently focus on environmental education, information, and awareness raising. Creating opportunities for marine experiences promotes attachment to the ocean and in turn ‘thicker’ marine citizenship. The results collectively point to a marine identity, formed through ocean connectedness and enabled by favourable socio-economic and policy conditions. When associated with good ocean health, marine identity can underpin and be reinforced by marine citizenship. Marine citizenship coincides with broader environmental and civic citizenship; therefore marine experience opportunities may contribute to wider acceptance of policy and public participation in the paradigmatic change now facing humans, as we attempt to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the coming years.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"The marine economy of the United Kingdom ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/120370","Stebbings, E; Papathanasopoulou, E; Hooper, T; et al.","March 2020","The marine and coastal environment is an important economic asset in the UK, and there is a need for greater information about marine economic activities for the purposes of marine management and policy. However, due to the difficulties of quantifying some marine sectors and separating them from terrestrial activities, the current size and structure of the marine economy is unknown. This paper defines a systematic approach to quantifying the UK marine economy, aiming to capture all activities in the market economy that occur within and depend upon UK marine and coastal environments, and estimates its contribution to the UK economy as a whole. The approach draws on previous research in this area and links sectors used in marine planning with the methodologies used in national accounts. The results suggest that the marine economy contributes double the amount of previous estimates to the UK economy. Changes in the structure of the marine economy, partly due to the expansion of offshore wind energy, may affect its economic contribution. The results also show that marine and coastal leisure and recreation sectors, which were previously thought to have a small economic contribution, are the second largest sector in the UK marine economy and account for the largest number of jobs. By disaggregating the economic sectors, the approach used here can underpin a marine natural capital approach, enabling economic activities to be linked with aspects of marine natural capital.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Managing marine turtles:  A study of marine turtle conservation science and policy. ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/3167","Richardson, PB","May 2011","Marine turtles are an ancient group of reptiles that have been used by humans as a source of protein for over 7,000 years. In recent decades, acknowledgement of the various threats to marine turtles, including the deleterious impact of historical and contemporary use on many populations, led the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to list all seven extant species of marine turtle on their Red List of Threatened Species. Consequently, marine turtles are often given protected status in the national legislation of countries around the world, despite the existence of ongoing use cultures in communities that live with marine turtles. Conservation strategies are challenged by the migratory nature of marine turtles, which have complex life histories typically involving the use of habitats in the jurisdictions of multiple sovereign states as well as the high seas. As a result, a suite of multi-lateral environmental agreements (MEAs) list marine turtles in the most highly protective categories. Thus, governments of sovereign states that have acceded to the various MEAs are committed to conservation strategies requiring national action and cooperative multi-lateral action, which can conflict with interests of communities with a tradition of marine turtle consumption. In this thesis I provide examples of how contemporary scientific research methods can elucidate the migratory behaviours of marine turtles, and can help define range of populations subject to national conservation action and use. I examine specific examples of how this information can inform national and multi-lateral conservation policies and strategies; how those policies and strategies interact and impact on traditional cultures of marine turtle use in the UK Overseas Territories in the Caribbean; and provide an example of the potential benefits of engaging stakeholders with contemporary research methods. This thesis highlights the utility of a multi-disciplinary approach to research underpinning marine turtle conservation and management, which acknowledges the limitations of MEAs and national government capacity, and which incorporates participation of those communities engaged in marine turtle consumption.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Constructive total loss: a critical and historical analysis ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/36781","Xu, M","April 2019","Constructive total loss is a concept that sits midway between partial loss and actual total loss. It entitles the assured to full indemnity where notice of abandonment has been duly served; otherwise he would recover no more than a partial loss, unless in certain circumstances, such a notice could be excused. Constructive total loss originated from the cases of capture, to rescue the plight of the assured where he could not claim for a loss under the policy until the ship was recaptured; and this was soon extended to cases of dispossession in other types and cases of damage. The application of the principle of constructive total loss, a doctrine peculiar to marine insurance, has addressed the intractable problems caused by sea perils, and has also balanced and protected the rights of both the assured and the underwriter. Considering the benefits of constructive total loss to the marine insurance market and the parties to the marine insurance policy, it is important to explore the possibility as to the application of constructive total loss to non-marine areas, especially industries in which large amounts of capital are often locked up, such as in the aviation industry. The purpose of this thesis is to trace the growth of the principle of constructive total loss, examining its application to hulls, cargo and freight, and then to consider whether the Marine Insurance Act 1906, a milestone in the marine insurance industry, is consistent with the earlier authorities, viz. how the Act echoes or alters the pre-statute cases and, how it works in the modern world. An application of constructive total loss coupled with a notice of abandonment, as generally set out, would not be properly applied to any indemnity contract other than that of marine insurance. However, regardless of the specific artificial terminology of ‘constructive total loss’, there is a trend for considerations of constructive total loss or a concept of commercial loss to be taken into account in ascertaining a total loss in non-marine cases. Concern that there is a need for its legal application in the non-marine area of insurance and prompted by developments in the insurance market, the issue as to whether constructive total loss has any part to play in the non-marine market is a remarkable and hotly-debated subject and will be comprehensively analysed here for the first time.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Environmental Damage Caused by Marine Litter: A Legal Discussion on Responsibility and its Allocation Among States ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/133311","Dan, HJ","June 2023","About two-thirds of the Earth is composed of oceans and is home to hundreds of millions of species of organisms. The oceans also absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide and play an essential role in mitigating climate change. In addition, the sea provides abundant resources, serves as the most critical transportation route for world trade and has significant value in terms of human economy and industry. As such, the ocean is closely related to our lives, and its importance is indescribable. However, the ocean, which is inextricably related to our lives, is greatly threatened by pollution, and one of the problems is pollution from marine litter.  Various marine organisms are physically affected by being entangled in or ingesting marine litter floating in the sea, and the invasion of alien species threatens the ecosystem through floating debris. Marine litter also affects marine industries such as shipping and tourism and has a serious impact on the human economy, society, and health through the sustainability and food chain of the marine environment. However, marine litter that negatively affects the marine environment and human life is becoming more serious.  Marine litter has a transboundary nature that moves to an area beyond its jurisdiction by currents, winds, and various natural phenomena. It also has the property of being oxidised and decomposed in the atmosphere and fragmented into fine pieces. It also moves through imports and exports of waste between countries. Waste transported to developing countries is often discharged into the ocean due to insufficient management capability. Therefore, marine litter is a pollutant that may differ between the person who initially generated it and the person who finally discharged it into the sea. In addition, marine litter is a pollutant composed of several polluters and victims, and in fact, it is an environmental issue in which we can all become polluters and victims. Moreover, the damage caused by marine litter often doesn't become immediately apparent. It may only become evident after a certain amount of time has passed and pollutants have accumulated. Therefore, identifying the causal relationship and measuring the damage caused by pollutants can be quite challenging.  Even though marine litter that has such a negative impact on the marine environment and human life is a pollutant that must be regulated, there is currently no legally binding treaty at the international level that directly regulates marine litter. In addition, there are many difficulties in determining responsibility for environmental damage caused by marine litter under the current responsibility regime in international environmental law.  Therefore, this thesis aims to present the responsibility and allocation of environmental damage caused by marine litter. To this end, this thesis suggests that it is necessary to adopt and apply international environmental principles to overcome the limitations of marine litter reduction, responsibility, and allocation. Moreover, this thesis will not only present a simple argument that marine litter should be reduced for environmental protection and the international community's attention is needed, but it will also constitute a piece of original research that suggests specific measures for the responsibility and allocation of marine litter.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Although reports by international – and national – organisations suggest there are economic benefits to Marine Spatial Planning this analysis has, to date, been aspatial. Employing an explorative Q methodology approach with ten participants, this paper seeks to address this spatial and distributive gap by exploring stakeholders (marine renewable energy, fishing industry, aquaculture and marine tourism) perceptions of the economic impacts of Marine Spatial Planning across varying (local to national) geographical scales in the UK. The paper develops a typology of three different perspectives on the economic impacts of Marine Spatial Planning: the optimistic ‘place-makers’; the sceptical ‘place-holders’; and the utilitarian ‘placeless’. Findings highlight that participants loading onto a specific ‘type’ cannot simply be explained by stakeholder categorisation. This research contributes to the coastal management literature by identifying differing perceptions on the ‘spatial economic impact’ of Marine Spatial Planning by economic actors utilising marine and coastal areas in the UK.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Although known to cause lethal or sub-lethal effects to vulnerable marine megafauna, population-level impacts of plastic pollution have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we compiled and evaluated information from peer-reviewed studies that reported deleterious individual-level effects of plastic pollution on air-breathing marine megafauna (i.e. seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles) worldwide, highlighting those that assessed potential population-level effects. Lethal and sub-lethal individual-level effects included drowning, starvation, gastrointestinal tract damage, malnutrition, physical injury, reduced mobility, and physiological stress, resulting in reduced energy acquisition and assimilation, compromised health, reproductive impairment, and mortality. We found 47 studies published between 1969 and 2020 that considered population-level effects of plastic entanglement (n = 26), ingestion (n = 19), or both (n = 2). Of these, 7 inferred population-level effects (n = 6, entanglement; n = 1, ingestion), whereas 19 lacked evidence for effects (n = 12, entanglement; n = 6, ingestion; n = 1, both). However, no study in the past 50 yr reported direct evidence of population-level effects. Despite increased interest in and awareness of the presence of plastic pollution throughout the world’s oceans, the extent and magnitude of demographic impacts on marine megafauna remains largely unassessed and therefore unknown, in contrast to well-documented effects on individuals. Addressing this major assessment gap will allow researchers and managers to compare relative effects of multiple threats—including plastic pollution—on marine megafauna populations, thus providing appropriate context for strategic conservation priority-setting.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Doing marine spatial zoning in coastal marine tropics: Palawan’s Environmental Critical Areas Network (ECAN) ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/131933","Madarcos, K; Fortnam, M; Gajardo, L; et al.","September 2022","Zoning is an important tool in marine spatial planning (MSP) for balancing the multi-uses of the marine environment. Whilst mainly developed conceptually and implemented in Europe and North America, marine zoning is becoming a popular tool for addressing diverse coastal marine issues in the tropics. However, we know little about how it is being implemented in practice in that context. In this study, we analysed the factors and strategies that enable and hinder the establishment of marine zoning in the low-income tropics through a case study of the 26-year history of the development of the Environmental Critical Areas Network (ECAN) in Palawan, Philippines. We employed two participatory methods: Innovation Histories to investigate how implementation barriers and opportunities change over time, and the Net-Map method to reveal the social relations and power distributions that enabled, blocked, and stalled its implementation. We found that MSP can be durable in these contexts when institutionalised in national law and adopted by local co-coordinative bodies, yet it remains an externally-driven agenda. Our study shows that the scaling up of zoning does not necessarily help resolve conflicts around marine and coastal space, and highlights the importance and influence of the political economy on MSP implementation and outcomes. We conclude that MSP's insensitivity to contextual power relations and politics raises concerns over social inclusivity, equity and justice. Moving forward, MSP implemented in the tropics needs to make conflicts, trade-offs and power distributions explicit at the outset through participatory decision-making that involves and empowers all stakeholders from the early stages of initiatives.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Risk Management in Ship Finance: A Marine Insurance Perspective ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/33735","Li, Chenxuan","November 2017","The long-standing concept of risk management in the financial sector has attracted more attention after the financial crisis of 2007–2008. In the context of ship finance, marine insurance has proven itself to be an effective tool to transfer certain shipping risks to insurers who are not directly involved in the ship finance projects. This thesis provides original suggestions concerning the role of marine insurance in ship finance, combining a financial perspective, an insurance perspective and a legal perspective. Marine insurance is a key risk management technique that fits into the general risk management process adopted by ship financiers. However, it is not necessarily the most appropriate technique in every particular case due to its limitations and costs. As a result, insurance gaps are identified to assist financiers in optimising the use of marine insurance and to help insurers to spot business opportunities. Marine insurance is a contract which is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the law. At the same time, marine insurance is a contract rather than a guarantee: if something goes wrong in the ship finance package and there is a marine policy, it should not be assumed that the policy represents money in the bank. Things can go wrong under the policy: apart from the legal risks relating to claims under the policy, the law itself may be a risk. In the context of ship finance, the risk transfer is not the only role of marine insurance. Other roles include, inter alia, reducing capital costs, improving the liquidity of shipowners and shipbuilders, and providing peace of mind for ship financiers. Nevertheless, such roles can only be created and sustained if the insurance contracts are carefully drafted and the legal risks are properly managed. The intention has been to state the law as it stands on October 28, 2017.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Marine litter, microplastics and marine megafauna ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/37172","Nelms, S","May 2019","Over the last sixty years, the development of synthetic and durable materials, namely plastic, coupled with a growing human population, has resulted in a rapid increase in the levels of anthropogenic debris in rivers, along coastlines and in the wider marine ecosystem. Currently, an estimated 4.8 to 12.7 million tons of plastic enter the oceans every year but this is expected to increase to between 9.6 and 25.4 million tons by 2025. As such, it is one of the most widely recognised pollution issues facing the planet due to its wide-ranging ecological and socio-economic implications. The main aims of this thesis were to i) examine citizen-science beach clean data to better understand the composition of anthropogenic litter deposited on British beaches by determining the most common items, materials, sources and pathways, and exploring the data for spatial patterns and temporal trends in litter density; ii) investigate an indirect pathway (trophic transfer) of microplastic (<5mm in size) ingestion in marine top predators by analysing scat (faeces) from captive grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) and the wild-caught fish they were fed upon; iii) explore the extent to which wild marine mammals ingest microplastics and consider the potential implications by examining the digestive tracts of 50 marine mammals from 10 species that stranded around the British coast; iv) develop a method of investigating dietary exposure of marine mammal top predators to microplastics, by combining scat-based molecular techniques (metabarcoding) with a microplastic isolation method. The research carried out for this thesis reveals that i) plastic is the main constituent of marine litter on British beaches and the majority of traceable items originate from land-based activities, such as public littering. The coasts of the southwest England and south Wales have the highest litter levels and certain items - small plastic fragments, plastic food packaging, wet wipes, polystyrene foam, balloons and large fishing net – are increasing; ii) trophic transfer is an indirect and under-studied, but potentially major, route of microplastic ingestion for marine top predators; iii) microplastics are ubiquitous within the digestive tracts of wild marine mammals stranded around the British coast but the overall low abundance suggests they may be egested; iv) the rate of microplastic ingestion by marine top predators may be related to the type of prey they consume but further work is needed to assess the impacts of this omnipresent pollutant.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Public perceptions of Oceans and Human Health: Key concerns and research priority preferences in Europe and Australia ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/129495","Davison, S","April 2022","Oceans and Human Health (OHH) is an emerging meta-discipline focusing on improving our understanding of the links between the marine environment and human health and wellbeing. However, there has been a lack of data investigating public perceptions of both the human health impacts from the marine environment, and public priorities for further OHH research. To explore these gaps, two large scale surveys were conducted as part of the current thesis; the pan-European Seas, Oceans and Public Health in Europe (SOPHIE) survey, collecting responses from 14 European countries with 14,167 respondents, and the Seas, Oceans and Public Health in Australia (SOPHIA) survey collecting a further 1,012 responses in Australia. Out of a range of potential threats, European and Australian respondents indicated that they were most concerned about the human health impacts of marine plastic pollution and expressed most support for research into better understanding the health implications of marine species protection. Further, given known heterogeneity among the public in terms of perceptions regarding other environmental issues (e.g. climate change), models were run to identify the individual-level characteristics predicting concern and research priority preferences. Quantifying attitudes, as well as understanding how individual-level differences shape concern and research preferences may enable policy makers and communicators to develop more targeted communications and initiatives aimed at reducing marine plastic pollution and tackling marine biodiversity loss.  * Some abstract data has been removed due to sensitivity.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Impacts of climate change on tourism and marine recreation ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/124575","Coles, T","January 2020","Tourism and marine recreation form a major component of the UK visitor economy, with the tourism sector alone worth £127 billion and accounting for 3.1 million jobs in 2017. Much of this activity takes place in coastal resorts and natural settings. While the nature and value of such activity and settings have been extensively researched, far less is known about the magnitude of possible impacts of climate change on them and the likely adaptations that will be necessary. Many likely effects recognised in 2013 remain broadly evident but have not been revisited in light of subsequent advances in climate science. The body of knowledge on ‘what is happening’ and ‘what may happen’ has not grown, and together this suggests a relative decline in the evidence base relating to tourism and marine recreation. Three knowledge gaps identified in 2013 (visitor preferences for conditions, vulnerability of coastal destinations, and the magnitude and timing of climate change impacts) have not been satisfactorily addressed in the interim. In 2019, the key challenges and emerging issues are more broadly based, namely: to move beyond the 2013 picture, in particular to consider the potential and effectiveness of current and planned approaches to adaptation; to appraise both vulnerabilities andopportunities for business more systematically; and to improve analytical precision by considering the effects ofclimate change on different types of tourism and marine recreation and the attendant combinations of activities, stakeholders and geographies at the local (i.e. destination) level.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Transformation through participation: Democratising the human-ocean relationship ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132520","Buchan, PM","December 2022","This chapter situates marine citizenship as a transdisciplinary tool for transforming the human-ocean relationship for sustainability. It considers marine citizens’ views on knowledge, and the role in particular of scientific and local place-based knowledge for marine management, and how knowledge and learning influence and are a part of marine citizenship. Marine citizens, it will be argued, intuitively integrate a range of knowledges and seek participation in ocean governance both through formal procedural decision-making processes and through informal community-building means. In this analysis, the post-normal science approach is invoked, extending the marine environmental peer community to include citizens, and incorporating knowledges and values from outside of academia, in order to create more effective, acceptable and legitimate solutions to marine issues. Viewing all people as having a right to act as a marine citizen asks the question of how accessible marine citizenship is as a political, individual, and collective act. The argument is made that there is an existing knowledge deficit about the right to environmental procedural participation which ocean literacy could address, and that reform is required to enable this democratisation of the human-ocean relationship.","Marine","University of Exeter"

"Integrating marine ecosystem services into macroeconomic modelling ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/124236","Stebbings, E","December 2020","The anticipated benefits of integrative economic frameworks, that link economic production with ecosystem impacts, have been well documented. However, due to the difficulties of separating the economic contribution of marine activities from those of terrestrial activities, the current size and structure of the marine economy is unknown. In addition, the capacity of natural capital assets to supply specific marine benefits is not comprehensively defined under current applications of the natural capital approach. Consequently, marine benefits have not been systematically linked with production in the economy, and the effect of causal relationships between the economy and marine natural capital assets have not been estimated. In response to these shortcomings, this thesis develops an integrative framework to combine macroeconomic systems with marine and coastal ecosystems under the natural capital approach in the UK. The framework combines marine natural capital assets and the environmental benefits they supply, with economic production. Firstly, the UK marine economy is systematically defined, using input-output tables for 2014. The contribution of all activities in the market economy that occur within, and depend upon, marine and coastal environments in the UK are analysed. Secondly, the way that benefits from natural capital are supplied is defined using a composite index. Characteristics of natural capital, and other forms of capital (i.e. financial, human, social, manufactured), that affect the supply of specific environmental benefits are analysed, and indicators for each characteristic are selected. Indicators are ranked and weighted, and benefit supply is represented as a composite index. Finally, the causal relationships between the economy and natural capital assets are identified and measured. Case studies from the UK marine and coastal environment are used to apply the framework using data from 2013 to 2018. The strengths of the integrative framework, and its shortcomings, are discussed in the context of the natural capital approach and its application to the marine environment.","Marine","University of Exeter"

One major contributor is industrial seismic surveys-a process typically undertaken to locate and estimate the quantity of oil and gas deposits beneath the seafloor-which, in recent years, has increased in magnitude and scope in some regions. Regulators permit this activity despite widespread uncertainties regarding the potential ecological impacts of seismic surveys and gaps in baseline information on some key species of conservation concern. Research to date suggests that impacts vary, from displacement to direct mortality, but these effects remain poorly understood for most species. Here, we summarize potential effects of seismic surveys, describe key knowledge gaps, and recommend broad-scale research priorities for 3 impacted taxonomic groups: fish, marine mammals, and sea turtles. We also suggest further technological advances, improved mitigation measures, and better policy and management structures to minimize the ecological impacts of seismic surveys in light of scientific uncertainty.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Marine turtles: a comprehensive review and an assessment of climate change-associated impacts in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/133018","Alameri, H","April 2023","Climate change threatens marine turtles that depend on beaches for nesting with temperature changes affecting embryonic development and sex determination. Sea level rise may destroy their nesting habitats, and warming temperatures may cause complete development failure and imbalanced sex ratios. It is critical, therefore, to understand the likely climate change impacts to ensure mitigation is undertaken. It is particularly useful to examine climate change impacts in areas already facing extreme environmental conditions. The northwestern Indian Ocean (NWIO) is a relatively understudied region regarding marine turtles. Key knowledge gaps helped shape the main aims of this thesis, and these are: 1. to understand the status of marine turtles in the NWIO region from published material and regional expert elicitation; 2. to analyze 20 years of available data on marine turtles in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; 3. to investigate nest temperatures in Abu Dhabi to estimate primary sex ratios and the likely impact of global climate change on population dynamics and conservation, and; 4. to estimate the level of nest inundation that might result from forecast sea level rises associated with climate change. My key findings were that: 1. Significant research and conservation efforts have focused on marine turtles across the NWIO region. I identified major threats, knowledge gaps, impediments to practical conservation, and strengths and opportunities towards creating a knowledge base for future research. 6 2. The long-term marine turtle conservation plan in Abu Dhabi Emirate covers nesting ecology, foraging, mortality investigations, and rehabilitation initiatives. The mean estimate of hawksbill turtle clutches per year was 220 while the foraging population of all species and all sizes found in the emirate is 5,550–7,488 individuals. The majority of mortality was due to drowning in abandoned nets. Further research, including additional in-water foraging studies, population structure, and comprehensive nesting trends, is vital. 3. Primary sex ratios of hawksbill hatchlings are prone to be highly female-biased (> 80 % female), and only nests in the first three weeks of the breeding season were likely to have produced male hatchlings. 4. Beaches at major nesting islands will be profoundly affected by inundation due to sea level rise, however, the core nesting areas will remain as potential nesting sites.

Marine species, though highly diverse, have been underrepresented so far in studies on chemosensory systems, and our knowledge mostly concerns the detection of airborne cues. A broader comparative approach is therefore desirable. Marine annelid worms with their rich behavioural repertoire represent attractive models for chemosensation. Here, we study the marine worm Platynereis dumerilii to provide the first comprehensive investigation of head chemosensory organ physiology in an annelid. By combining microfluidics and calcium imaging, we record neuronal activity in the entire head of early juveniles upon chemical stimulation. We find that Platynereis uses four types of organs to detect stimuli such as alcohols, esters, amino acids and sugars. Antennae are the main chemosensory organs, compared to the more differentially responding nuchal organs or palps. We report chemically evoked activity in possible downstream brain regions including the mushroom bodies (MBs), which are anatomically and molecularly similar to insect MBs. We conclude that chemosensation is a major sensory modality for marine annelids and propose early Platynereis juveniles as a model to study annelid chemosensory systems.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Valuing the health benefits of physical activities in the marine environment and their importance for marine spatial planning ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/18645","Spencer, Anne; Papathanasopoulou1, E; White, MP; et al.","November 2015","The marine environment provides a number of services which contribute to human well-being including the provision of food, regulation of climate and the provision of settings for cultural gains. To ensure these services continue to be provided, effective management is required and is being strategically implemented through the development of marine spatial plans. These plans require an understanding of the costs and benefits associated with alternative marine uses and how they contribute to human well-being. One benefit which is often difficult to quantify is the health benefit of engaging with the marine environment. To address this, the research develops an approach which can estimate the contribution aquatic physical activities makes to quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in monetary and non-monetary terms. Using data from the Health Survey for England, the research estimates that physical activities undertaken in aquatic environments at a national level provides a total gain of 24,853 QALYs. A conservative estimate of the monetary value of a QALY gain of this magnitude is £176 million. This approach provides estimates of health benefits which can be used in more comprehensive impact assessments, such as cost-benefit analysis to compare alternative marine spatial plans.

"Improving marine viral metagenomics through long read sequencing ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/128995","Warwick-Dugdale, J","March 2022","As arch manipulators of their host communities’, marine phages (viruses of bacteria) are key players in global biogeochemical cycles. Phage-mediated host lysis is a critical component of nutrient cycles and structures host communities. Horizontal gene transfer and co-evolution alter host-substrate interactions. Phages even ‘hijack’ their hosts, modifying host function to maximise virus production, or to improve host fitness for survival of the infected cell. Unfortunately investigation of marine viruses is hampered by the low proportion of hosts in culture and the resulting dearth of model host-virus systems. As phages lack a universal marker gene for PCR-based survey, metagenomic approaches have become the standard approach for assessments of viral community structure. However, viral ‘populations’ (equivalent: species) which are highly microdiverse (i.e. diverse at single nucleotide level) and/or replete with hypervariable regions (i.e. extremely variable regions within viral populations) fail to assemble from short-read metagenomic datasets. The central aim of this thesis was to leverage long-read sequencing technology for better characterisation of marine viral community diversity and structure. Here, I present ‘VirION’ (Viral, long-read metagenomics via MinION sequencing), a hybrid, short- and long-read sequencing and informatics workflow. After validation with mock viral communities, VirION was applied to both coastal (Western English Channel) and Open Ocean (Sargasso Sea) samples. The results here show that VirION captured: I). Many globally abundant and ubiquitous viruses missing from short-read metagenomic assemblies; II) Viral genomes that were more microdiverse and hypervariable-region rich than those in short-read assemblies; III) Hypervariable regions containing niche-defining genes of host origin, plus genes likely involved in host-virus interactions and host-hijacking; IV) Single-virus resolution in variations of viral hypervariable regions. Although this approach did not improve host-prediction, the identification of many previously ‘invisible’ viruses, including their host-virus interaction hotspots, improved characterisation of marine dsDNA phage communities, and should be used to guide future investigations of viral ecosystem function. Further development of VirION for the capture of cell-associated-, ssDNA and RNA viruses could provide a powerful tool for environmental monitoring whose scope goes beyond marine systems.","Marine","University of Exeter"

In this paper we develop an interdisciplinary and inclusive conceptualisation of marine citizenship. We use mixed methods to study the views and experiences of active marine citizens in the United Kingdom to broaden understandings of marine citizens’ characterisation of marine citizenship, and their perceptions of its importance in policy- and decision-making. Our study shows that marine citizenship entails more than individual pro-environmental behaviours, and includes public-facing and socially collective political actions. We contextualise the role of knowledge, finding more complexity than normative knowledge-deficit approaches permit. We illustrate the importance of a rights-based framing of marine citizenship which incorporates political and civic rights to participate in the transformation of the human-ocean relationship for sustainability. Recognising this more inclusive approach to marine citizenship, we propose an expanded definition to support further exploration of the multiple dimensions and complexities of marine citizenship and to enhance its benefits for marine policy and management.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Stakeholder perceptions of a coastal marine protected area ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/31780","Clarke, B; Thurstan, R; Yates, K","March 2016","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an increasingly utilised marine and coastal management tool, with rates of designation rising steeply over the last twenty years. MPAs are most commonly designated for biological conservation objectives and the management is thus focused primarily on meeting conservation goals, with associated monitoring programs gathering data on a narrow suite of biological indicators. However, MPAs also have a wide range of potential social and economic impacts and the ability to meet the goals of an MPA is highly influenced by the often unmonitored perceptions and buy-in of local stakeholders. Here we examine a range of stakeholder perceptions concerning a coastal MPA in South Australia. We conducted semi-structured interviews with individuals engaged in the MPA's planning and designation process, as well as those involved with its ongoing management. We explored their understanding of the purpose of the MPA, whether they thought the MPA was successful and the future management challenges the MPA might face. In particular, we focused on eliciting from stakeholders indicators they thought should be used to monitor the ongoing performance of the MPA. Perceptions varied between stakeholder groups, however, the majority of respondents highlighted the importance of socioeconomic factors in the ongoing performance of the MPA. The vast majority of them suggested both biological and socio-economic indicators that should be incorporated into monitoring programs. Our findings highlight the need for MPA planning and management, when defining goals and developing monitoring programs, to be mindful to incorporate social and economic, as well as, biological indicators.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Developmental Toxicity of Microplastic Leachates on Marine Larvae ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/121177","Rendell-Bhatti, F","May 2020","Marine plastic pollution is now considered a diverse contaminant suite, differing in product origin, polymer composition, size, morphology, colour, additives and environmental co-contaminants. The environmental hazards associated with marine plastic pollution have been widely documented, however much of the existing research has yet to document developmental abnormalities observed when biota develop in plastic contaminated systems. The effect of microplastic leachate exposure on two marine echinoderms early developmental stages were investigated. Psammechinus milaris and Paracentrotus lividus embryonic and larval cultures were exposed to leachates derived from industrial or environmental exposed plastic pellets to investigate the effect of polymer additives and environmental contaminants. Toxicity was evaluated morphologically using images of live embryos and larvae, along with immunostaining of key developmental tissue groups to determine the extent of impact on a physiological level. This body of work suggests that leachates from pellets exposed to environmental contaminates (biobead and pre-production nurdle pellets) and highly plasticised industrial pellets (polyvinyl chloride) elicit severe, consistent and treatment-specific phenotypes in P. lividus embryonic and larval developmental stages, with impacts on morphogenic processes. Key differences in larvae morphology were documented between plastic types and environmental exposure. Industrial polyvinyl chloride pellets elicited the most pronounced abnormalities from the wild type at 24 hours post-fertilisation. However, leachates from un-plasticised industrial polyethylene pellets showed little differences from the wildtype with regards to developmental timing and abnormalities. Leachates from environmental sourced pellets elicited the most severe developmental delays and abnormalities at 48 hours post-fertilisation. Preliminary chemical analysis was also performed on industrial and beached pellet leachates, to investigate compound composition and to determine possible contributors to the developmental defects. To summarise, the findings suggest industrial and environmental microplastic leachate exposure elicits morphological malformations and specific abnormalities in neural, cilia and muscle tissues groups in both embryonic and larval stages of marine larvae of P. lividus. However, more research and investigation are needed to draw conclusive data.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Marine turtles are large marine vertebrates with complex life histories and highly mobile behaviour that may make them particularly vulnerable to its impacts. The main goals of this thesis were to i) evaluate the potential implications of the presence of plastic pollution in the environment to marine turtles by reviewing current literature ii) provide a global summary of the issue of entanglement in this taxon, utilising a global network of experts iii) explore the drivers of key interactions between marine turtles and plastic ingestion and develop novel additions classification methodologies to explore selective ingestion of plastics iv) develop a methodology for investigating and isolating the presence of microplastic ingestion in marine turtle gut content and v) examine plastic pollution on a key habitat for marine turtles e.g. nesting beaches. Major findings of the thesis include i) the issue of entanglement with plastic debris, the majority in ghost fishing gear, is both an under-reported and under-researched threat ii) a clear display of strong diet-related ingestion towards plastic debris that resemble natural food items, utilising a case study of green turtles in Northern Cyprus iii) a method development that allowed the identification and isolation of a suite synthetic particles in gut content residue samples, providing evidence of ingestion of synthetic debris at the microscopic size class iv) a more comprehensive viewpoint on plastic concentrations on nesting beaches, in the form of 3D sampling to investigate subsurface plastic densities, showing microplastics present down to turtle nesting depth of both loggerhead and green turtles in Northern Cyprus. In conclusion, this thesis forms the most detailed and comprehensive investigation to date on the impacts of this pollutant on the taxon of marine turtles; contributing to knowledge into macro and microplastic ingestion, entanglement and key habitats through method development and integration of marine turtle feeding ecology and developmental biology.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Here I present a body of work investigating the distribution and movement of microplastics through the marine ecosystems via transportation and transformation pathways. First, I look at litter items of beaches of the Cornish coast, demonstrating that 41% of litter was plastics fragments unattributable to source and that this litter was continually re-stocked such that it was always present despite cleaning efforts. Then I took to the seas to conduct sea surface trawls in the North East Atlantic to investigate the floating proportion of marine plastic debris. Microplastics were found in every sample, yet were highly variable in concentration over geographic space ranging from 0.038 to 0.45 particles m-3. Counter to the prevailing trends, plastic fragments (84 μm – 21.8 mm) were the dominant shape (63%), with fewer fibres present. The likelihood of encounter and therefore risk of plastic to plankton was calculated and it was found that for every 1 plastic particle, there were between 500 and 1000 plankton, suggesting very low risk of biological uptake for this region. Plastics are not just found on the sea surface and are increasingly found in benthic sediments and biota. I tested whether marine snows would act as a transport mechanism of plastics from the surface to the seafloor. I demonstrate that under experimental conditions a range of plastic particle sizes, shapes, and polymer types, all readily incorporated into marine snows. This incorporation into marine snows both overcame the buoyancy of floating particles but also increased the sinking rate of dense particles. Buoyant polyethylene went from floating as a free particle to sinking at 818 m day–1","Marine","University of Exeter"

In natural systems, coastlines would migrate landwards, but because most of the world's human population occupies the coast, anthropogenic structures (such as sea walls or buildings) have been constructed to defend the shore and prevent loss of property. This can result in a net reduction in beach area, a phenomenon known as ""coastal squeeze"", which will reduce beach availability for species such as marine turtles. As of yet, no global assessment of potential future coastal squeeze risk at marine turtle nesting beaches has been conducted. We used Google Earth satellite imagery to enumerate the proportion of beaches over the global nesting range of marine turtles that are backed by hard anthropogenic coastal development (HACD). Mediterranean and North American nesting beaches had the most HACD, while the Australian and African beaches had the least. Loggerhead and Kemp's ridley turtle nesting beaches had the most HACD, and flatback and green turtles the least. Future management approaches should prioritise the conservation of beaches with low HACD to mitigate future coastal squeeze.","Marine","University of Exeter"

However, factors describing the supply of benefits, and their links with economic sectors, are not well defined.  This study develops a novel framework that investigates how the combination of different forms of capital (natural, financial, social, manufactured or human) provide a potential supply of benefits, and how changes in quality or extent of natural capital affects supply. Factors affecting the delivery of benefits are analysed, and indicators for each factor are selected. Indicators are ranked and weighted, and benefit supply is represented as a novel, composite index. The composite supply index is then linked as an input to a related economic sector.  This framework is applied for the first time to four benefits from the marine environment in the UK: seafood, offshore wind energy, wildlife watching and water sports. The approach is compatible with national accounts, natural capital accounts, and established ecosystem service classifications. This study shows how linking economic sectors with benefits can provide new evidence in support of marine management.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Specific case studies from a tidal energy site and a wave energy site are used to demonstrate how increased environmental monitoring can improve marine operations and resource assessment procedures. In particular, the outcomes demonstrate areas in which real time measurements can increase working limits for marine operations, and spatial data sets can improve both baseline and monitoring of environmental impacts. Applying the methods described here has the potential to reduce costs for marine operations, increase the accuracy of resource assessments and associated site design, and support more sensitive methods for environmental assessment. These are measures that would reduce uncertainty, and increase stakeholder confidence in the adequate environmental monitoring of marine energy projects.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Under continuing climate change, marine species and communities are predicted to change their distribution to follow preferred thermal conditions. However, availability of suitable habitats and depths will limit opportunities for many species, especially those with physiological and ecological dependence on benthic habitats and demersal communities. This thesis begins in Chapter 1 by exploring existing research recording how climate change has affected marine species, especially those in the Northeast Atlantic, followed by a summary of how future marine warming is predicted to change species distributions, abundances and associated harvesting opportunities. In Chapter 2, the influence of relatively fine-scale environmental variation on European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) growth in the North Sea is analysed. Detailed analysis of spatially segregated plaice sub-groups shows that accepted growth responses to temperature variation are not always seen in heavily exploited fish that don’t reach their full age and size potential. Chapter 3 presents current, and predicts future, distribution of key commercial fish species in the North Sea. Standardised survey data are used to develop, test and predict species abundances using generalised additive models (GAMs) coupled with climate projections to 2050. The models predict that future distributions of demersal (bottom-dwelling) fish will be strongly constrained by availability of preferred habitat at suitable depth, unless species are able to acclimate or adapt to tolerate warmer conditions or move to previously uninhabitable locations. Chapter 4 presents analysis on a newly compiled fisheries survey dataset, spanning from the southern end of Spain to the northern coast of Norway, and standardises the data using least square mean estimates of abundance. Principal coordinate analysis suggests that surface temperature is the main driver of fish assemblages, alongside salinity, depth and nitrate. Under future warming scenarios, we predict that whole fish assemblages will shift northwards and eastwards by 2050 and increasingly by 2100. Chapter 5 reports on an analysis spanning the past century of marine global warming showing that abundance increases have been more prominent in marine species studied towards the poleward extent of their ranges, with abundance declines more prominent at the equatorward extent of ranges. This evidence of omnipresent large-scale changes in abundance of marine species is consistent with warming over the last century, suggesting that adaptation has not provided a buffer against the negative effects of warmer conditions at the equatorward extent of species ranges. Together this body of research shows restrictions on distributions for many species over recent decades. However, species studied at their extreme range margins and predictions for the future show species tracking their preferred thermal range. Therefore, projected sea temperature increases of up to 1.5°C over pre-industrial levels to 2050 and 2100 will likely drive latitudinal abundance shifts in marine species. Not all species are predicted to shift at the same rate likely resulting in mismatches between more mobile species that are able to track thermal preferences and those that rely on suitable benthic and demersal habitats and communities to thrive. This has repercussions for both wider ecological functioning and commercial opportunities, especially across the heavily exploited Northeast Atlantic and for species already showing adaptive responses to fishing pressure.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"It’s not just a Blue Economy moment… ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/26919","Morrissey, KM","March 2017","Winder and Le Heron (2017) advocate for geographers to engage directly and critically with the Blue Economy and to remove the ‘disciplinary framings’ from which the notion of the Blue Economy has emerged. While endorsing Winder and Le Heron’s call for human geography to engage with debates about the Blue Economy, I argue that the lack of critical engagement within the geographical community with respect to the Blue Economy has not been imposed by disciplinary framings. Instead I ask Winder and Le Heron to clarify how a social and cultural critique of the Blue Economy will expand the current knowledge base of our oceans and seas. I also ask whether a critique of extensive literature within economics, planning and governance on the ocean resource have been the building blocks for the critical analysis of the Blue Economy provided by Winder and Le Heron.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Carbon Capture and Storage and the Marine Environment: Impact assessment and assurance monitoring ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132242","Blackford, J","January 2023","Underground storage of CO2 as part of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) provides an option for significant reduction of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel power generation and other industrial processes as well as facilitating direct air capture. Although CCS will mitigate climate change, international regulations and societal expectations require that storage integrity is assured and environmental issues of deployment are considered, in particular related to the unplanned release of CO2. Globally many storage sites are located offshore within continental shelves, necessitating both a marine environmental impact assessment and an appropriate offshore monitoring strategy coupled with appropriate communication to enhance public understanding. This thesis by papers contains a body of work addressing both impact and monitoring challenges, primarily mediated using modelling approaches but also describing a novel real-world CO2 release experiment. The experiment revealed the previously unconsidered complexity of CO2 flow through and reactivity within sediments and behaviour in the water column. This work established the challenges associated with monitoring and detection informing further research programmes focused on increasing the technology readiness levels of sensors and developing monitoring strategies. As a result of the body of work presented here it is possible to constrain potential impacts, relative to leakage rates and conclude that only large-scale catastrophic leaks would have the capacity to inflict significant environmental damage. This work also identifies a potentially cost efficient and highly sensitive detection/assurance methodology, based on an understanding of leakage dynamics and natural variability of the marine system.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"“That most useful body of men”: the Operational Doctrine and Identity of the British Marine Corps, 1755-1802 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/117786","Zerbe, Britt Wyatt","September 2010","The Corps of Marines 1755-1802 (after 1802, Royal Marines) was the smallest of the three military services of the late eighteenth century British Armed Nation.  Because of this, their history has largely been marginalised - or if dealt with, only in broad three hundred year studies.  However, their importance has been largely underestimated.  With the rise in the late eighteenth century of a more coherent ‘Blue-Water Strategy’, classified later by some historians as a uniquely ‘British Way in Warfare’, there was a need to have an operational organisation from which to implement Britain’s grand strategy.  The two other contemporary military organizations (Army and Navy) were too large, had internal resistance to, or simply had one-dimensional geographic identification which prevented the full pure operational implementation of British amphibious power.  With the dawn of the Seven Years War the government gave this operational priority to the Navy, which began in earnest with the formation of the British Marine Corps.  The Navy, and Marines, were able to do this by constructing an operational doctrine and identity for its new Marine Corps.  With the forty-seven year construction of its operational doctrine and identity, the Marines not only assisted in the implementation of British grand strategy, but also were pivotal in the protection of the empire. This dissertation is separated into two distinct parts.  The first part outlines the skeleton of the Marines; their past formations, administration and manpower construct.  The second part outlines the trials and tribulations of construction and institutionalisation of the Marine Corps within the British nation of the late-eighteenth century.  This part reveals the non-combat usage, operational development and imperial rapid reaction force aspects of the Marines.  Marines were to carry out many protection and security related duties on land and at sea.  Because of this they were given direct access to weapons which in the unfortunate event of mutiny might be used against the men.  Naval and amphibious combat were the main justifications for why the Marine Corps existed to begin with.  Marines were to develop their own special ‘targeted’ suppression fire and a reliance on the bayonet for both of these operations.  Importantly Empire; its maintenance, expansion, and protection was an essential element of the Marines existence.   Marines were to become an imperial rapid reaction force that could be sent anywhere a naval ship was and used to suppress disorders.  Identity was the tool of three powers (Public, Admiralty and Marine Corps) in their construction of this body of men.  Marines’ identity allowed them to be relied upon for a multitude of duties, including the basic protection of order on ship.   By understanding all of these areas not only will it expand historical scholarship on how the British state constructed and implemented its policy decisions, but also how an organisation creates and validates its own purpose of existence.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Given that instrumental measurements of the oceans go back no further than a few decades, the only way in which we can assess the long-term baseline variability that characterizes the pre-perturbation equilibrium state of the marine environment is by the use of proxy records contained in stratified or layered natural archives such as corals, fish otoliths and bivalve mollusc shells. In this chapter we will look at the ways in which the environmental signals recorded in the shells of bivalve molluscs can be used to shed light on marine variability both in the present and over past centuries and millennia, and specifically how they can be used to study marine climate, the marine environment and the economic and cultural history of the relationship between humans and the oceans. The chapter is divided into two parts: section one describes the morphological, geochemical and crystallographic techniques that are used to obtain information from the shells, while section two covers the use of bivalve shells in a wide range of applications, including ecosystem services, environmental monitoring, archaeology, climate reconstruction, and climate modeling.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Investigating conflict between threatened marine megavertebrates and Mediterranean small-scale fisheries ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/36636","Snape, R","March 2019","Most fish stocks are being extracted at unsustainable rates and through bycatch, many marine megavertebrate species have unfavourable conservation status. The sheer number and diversity of small-scale fishing vessels worldwide presents a challenge to monitoring and research, therefore compared to industrialised fisheries, little is known about their activities or their sustainability. This thesis addresses this information gap by examining motorised polyvalent vessels <12 m length in the Mediterranean, which make up over 80 % of the fleet. We take North Cyprus as a case example to scrutinise interactions with marine turtles and dolphins. Marine turtle mortalities were found to be common (of the order of 1000 turtles caught annually; 60 % mortality), with trammel nets targeting Siganidae likely the greatest source of mortality. During the nesting season, breeding loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) were poorly protected from fishing pressure by a proposed Marine Protected Area, while both green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead turtles under-used areas within the reserve. After nesting in Cyprus, loggerhead turtles used foraging areas across the eastern Mediterranean, where they were impacted by a range of fisheries with small-scale fisheries likely leading to the mortality of three study animals. Dolphins frequented 28 % of set nets and small numbers were present in fishing areas year-round. Although infrequent, dolphin bycatch was considered to have population level impacts. A pinger was trialled but had no effect on interactions. Dolphin depredation cost fishers thousands of euro annually, while landings were estimated to be far beyond those previously reported. A tool was developed to provide spatiotemporal activity data on small-scale fisheries and this tool was used to demonstrate potential conflict between seabirds, sea turtles and protected habitats in MPAs and in a Marine IBA. The results presented using anthropological surveys, strand monitoring, onboard observation, telemetry, vessel tracking and acoustic monitoring, will be useful in developing fisheries policy for North Cyprus and in directing Marine Spatial Planning. Novel techniques developed will be relevant in addressing fisheries interactions with marine megavertebrates in small-scale fisheries globally.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Microplastic ingestion ubiquitous in marine turtles ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/35328","Duncan, EM; Broderick, AC; Fuller, WJ; et al.","December 2018","Despite concerns regarding the environmental impacts of microplastics, knowledge of the incidence and levels of synthetic particles in large marine vertebrates is lacking. Here, we utilize an optimized enzymatic digestion methodology, previously developed for zooplankton, to explore whether synthetic particles could be isolated from marine turtle ingesta. We report the presence of synthetic particles in every turtle subjected to investigation (n = 102) which included individuals from all seven species of marine turtle, sampled from three ocean basins (Atlantic [ATL]: n = 30, four species; Mediterranean (MED): n = 56, two species; Pacific (PAC): n = 16, five species). Most particles (n = 811) were fibres (ATL: 77.1% MED: 85.3% PAC: 64.8%) with blue and black being the dominant colours. In lesser quantities were fragments (ATL: 22.9%: MED: 14.7% PAC: 20.2%) and microbeads (4.8%; PAC only; to our knowledge the first isolation of microbeads from marine megavertebrates). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of a subsample of particles (n = 169) showed a range of synthetic materials such as elastomers (MED: 61.2%; PAC: 3.4%), thermoplastics (ATL: 36.8%: MED: 20.7% PAC: 27.7%) and synthetic regenerated cellulosic fibres (SRCF; ATL: 63.2%: MED: 5.8% PAC: 68.9%). Synthetic particles being isolated from species occupying different trophic levels suggest the possibility of multiple ingestion pathways. These include exposure from polluted seawater and sediments and/or additional trophic transfer from contaminated prey/forage items. We assess the likelihood that microplastic ingestion presents a significant conservation problem at current levels compared to other anthropogenic threats.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Global review of shark and ray entanglement in anthropogenic marine debris ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/38111","Parton, KJ; Galloway, TS; Godley, BJ","July 2019","Numerous marine taxa become entangled in anthropogenic marine debris, including cartilaginous fishes (class: Chondrichthyes, e.g. elasmobranchs [sharks, skates and rays], holocephalans [chimaeras]). Here we review research that has been conducted on the susceptibility of these taxa to entanglement in marine debris by conducting a systematic literature review complemented by novel data collection from the social media site Twitter. Our literature review yielded 47 published elasmobranch entanglement events (N = 557 animals) in 26 scientific papers, with 16 different families and 34 species in all 3 major ocean basins affected. The most common entangling objects were ghost fishing gear (74% of animals) followed by polypropylene strapping bands (11% of animals), with other entangling materials such as circular plastic debris, polythene bags and rubber tyres comprising 1% of total entangled animals. Most cases were from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans (49 and 46%, respectively), with a bias towards the USA (44% of animals), the UK (30% of animals) and South Africa (10% of animals). While investigating Twitter, we found 74 cases of elasmobranch entanglement, representing 14 families and 26 species. On Twitter, ghost fishing gear was again the most common entangling material (94.9% of animals), with the majority of entanglement records originating from the Atlantic Ocean (89.4% of total entangled animals). Entanglement in marine debris is symptomatic of a degraded marine environment and is a clear animal welfare issue. Our evidence suggests, however, that this issue is likely a far lesser threat to this taxon than direct or indirect take in marine fisheries. We highlight a relative paucity of scientific data on this subject and recommend a standardisation of reporting in an attempt to accurately quantify elasmobranch entanglement risks and locate interaction hotspots.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"The War at Sea: Trafalgar and Beyond ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/126284","Davey, JP","December 2022","This chapter argues that the conflict at sea was an important and frequently overlooked part of the Napoleonic Wars. Focusing primarily on the Royal Navy and French maritime forces, but also mentioning the navies of Spain, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and United States, it outlines the manifold ways in which maritime warfare shaped wider events on land, and helped determine the conflict’s final outcome. It demonstrates that French attempts to invade Britain were successfully rebuffed by the Royal Navy, ensuring that Britain remained in the conflict. The chapter then offers a more modern take on the commonly misunderstood Battle of Trafalgar, arguing that it was far from decisive and did little to change the course of the war. The naval conflict continued in earnest after 1805, and the war of trade became all-consuming, particularly after the inception of ‘Napoleon’s Continental system’. Here the navy offered a stubborn resistance to the French Emperor’s objectives, helping to encourage illicit trade with the European continent while also expanding Britain’s empire and mercantilist reach elsewhere in the globe. Finally, it demonstrates that maritime support was crucial to the land war, not least Wellington’s Peninsula campaign.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Serving the State: empire, expertise and the British hemp crisis, 1800-1801 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/32689","Davey, JP","March 2018","This article investigates a governmental committee set up in 1800 to address a long-standing problem faced by the British state: how to procure a reliable and cost-effective supply of hemp. This resource, on which the Royal Navy and mercantile marine relied, could be procured only from the Russian territories of northern Europe, a dependence that had proved precarious and increasingly unreliable in the latter decades of the eighteenth century. In 1800, amid a great European war, the supply of hemp was permanently stopped by the Russian tsar, and the British government formed a committee charged with finding new sources of this material, debating which regions should be invested in and encouraging future cultivation. The investigation that followed was truly global in its scope, focusing overwhelmingly on the resources of the British Empire, as botany, agriculture and the global acquisition of resources became issues of governmental concern. The investigation also forced the British state to look beyond its own departments, as numerous civilian, mercantile and agricultural experts were brought in to give evidence and offer suggestions. Studying this committee presents an opportunity to analyse how the state worked to solve problems and how it considered various (and often competing) notions of expertise and authority, as various individuals were called in to serve. Additionally, it demonstrates how people inside and outside government conceived of the broader utility and purpose of the British Empire at the turn of the nineteenth century.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"To the Nadir and Back: The Executive Branch of the Royal Navy 1918-1939 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/4451","Farquharson-Roberts, Michael Atholl","October 2012","The Royal Navy, and especially its leadership, is perceived to have performed poorly in the First World War and its officers have been described as being automatons who only came alive when directed by superiors. By contrast in the Second World War the Royal Navy and its officers are seen as having ‘done well,’ displaying flair and initiative. There does not appear to have been any attempt to look in any detail at what, if anything, changed in the twenty years between the wars to explain the perceived improvement. This thesis critically examines the executive branch of the Royal Navy, and contends that the navy adapted and modified the training of its officers to meet whatever was required of them; when they were required to passively obey orders as in the Grand Fleet of the First World War, they had been trained for that eventuality, when to show initiative likewise.   During the 1920s the officer corps was mismanaged and morale and motivation suffered badly. The influence of the Admiralty civil service, the repository of institutional memory, which managed junior officers’ careers, was conservative and resistant to change. Changes in training both before and after the mutiny at Invergordon (September 1931) brought the officer corps up to date and set it on track for its outstanding performance in the next war, in particular recognising that leadership was not an innate class based ability, but had to be taught and developed. However, the navy had since the latter part of the nineteenth century changed the emphasis of officer’s career paths; specialist training was seen as the ‘route to the top’ and command was downgraded as a necessary part of an officer’s career development. It was only during the latter part of Second World War that having exercised command at sea was recognised as being an important part of an officer’s experience.   The thesis also addresses the ‘RNVR myth’ that the Royal Navy was only able to prosecute the Second World War successfully because of an influx of well educated temporary officers and that they were the major driving force.   This thesis has been largely based on primary sources, including personnel records which have not been studied before and have been examined in such a way as to allow statistical analysis.","Navy","University of Exeter"

"Changes and challenges: The Royal Navy's China Station and Britain's East Asian empire during the 1920s ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/37423","Heaslip, M","June 2019","Examining Britain’s position in 1920s East Asia at a point amid changes in the international balance of power, this thesis bridges the gap between the existing imperial and naval accounts of a key transition point in global history. In doing so, it focuses upon the foremost organisation involved in maintaining and supporting the peripheral regions of imperial influence, the Royal Navy’s China Station. The thesis provides an important new segment to help in explaining the wider story of the slow decline of British imperial and naval dominance in the 1920s. Foremost among the findings is an emphasis on how heavily inter-related Britain’s strategies for China and Japan were during the decade. Indeed, China was expected by the Admiralty to play a pivotal role in any future relationship between the British Empire and the increasingly expansionist Japan, which adds a significant new angle to existing discussion of Britain’s far eastern defence strategy. Providing fresh insights into how those grand strategies were implemented in practice, the thesis shows how naval officers serving in the region willingly and repeatedly deviated from official policy on a day-to-day basis in order to assist their counterparts from friendly powers. Likewise, the evolving threats posed by state and sub-state actors in China are shown to have led to the deployment of vast Royal Navy task force to Shanghai in 1927, which is now generally overlooked and misunderstood. That event marked the last time Britain was able to confidently display its global naval dominance to the world. Among the more controversial findings, the thesis reveals how the Admiralty secretly circumvented the Washington Treaty by developing military aviation capabilities at Hong Kong under the guise of imperial policing. In doing so it provides the first clear evidence that alongside Germany and Japan, Britain was also actively contravening the post-1918 disarmament treaties it had only recently signed. Away from preparations for another major conflict, the thesis also provides a fresh examination of the contrasting accounts of two violent clashes involving Britain in 1920s China. In doing so, the thesis shows that it is possible to establish a more balanced understanding of events such as the Nanjing and Wanxian incidents, despite the highly polarised accounts of what happened. Finally, the human side of the story is explored, during which the thesis discusses changing attitudes towards and use of Victorian gunboat diplomacy. Moreover, the stresses of commanding gunboats in such isolated circumstances are shown to have pushed some young officers beyond breaking point, with disastrous consequences for themselves and others. Archival material that is entirely new to histories of the Royal Navy has been used throughout the thesis, adding crucial details such as the important role of Treaty Port volunteer corps in influencing warship deployments. Likewise, by delving deep into the naval archives, the thesis helps to move the imperial histories beyond the wall of steel and blue uniforms to consider the Royal Navy as a complex entity containing a diverse set of individuals. In combination the thesis provides the first detailed examination of the Royal Navy’s everyday work maintaining the British Empire in East Asia against the wider backdrop of the transformative changes in world geopolitics.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Vikings and victories: sea stories from ‘The seafarer’ to Skyfall and the future of British maritime culture ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/16695","Gibson, Marion","May 2015","In 2011 Nick Harvey, Communication and Campaigns manager for Seafarers UK,  wrote an article for the Maritime Foundation deploring what he called ‘alarming ignorance of our island nation’s dependence on the sea’: ‘Our nationwide survey revealed that general maritime knowledge amongst the public at large is severely lacking, and ‘sea blindness’ is a huge problem’, he stated. Knowledge of Britain’s past and present seafarers appeared patchy and a character from American film was identified by some as Britain’s greatest seaman. But why might Britain have become ‘sea-blind’, as the survey results suggest? Building on Harvey’s claim that the fictional Jack Sparrow has replaced Alfred the Great and Nelson as a national maritime icon, this article seeks to demonstrate the close connection between literary culture, the politics of identity and the fortunes of the British seafaring tradition, especially its navy. The representation of seafarers in a literary trend is seen to be an accurate indicator of the nation’s attitude to maritime activities at any given time. Bringing together interdisciplinary perspectives, the article suggests that the impact of literary and filmic depictions is more important than has been recognised: opinion formers are likely to be influenced by such depictions rather than or alongside overt arguments about hardware or policy.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"The birth of naval history: audience and objectivity in British eighteenth-century historical writing ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/126231","Davey, J","September 2021","During the early decades of the eighteenth century the first general naval histories were published in Britain. Individuals from a range of backgrounds claimed ownership of this new and burgeoning subject, all professing to have produced the most reliable and accurate histories of the navy. Their competing publications provoked considerable debate, with authors drawn into fighting a war of words in the national press. These disputes raised important questions about the study of the past. Who should write naval history? How should it be written? Who was it written for? This article places naval history in the broader context of British politics, society and culture, investigating three works of naval history published between 1720 and 1735. It analyses their authorship and intended audience, suggesting that the production of these works was a symptom of a society quickly becoming enamoured with its naval past, and keen to record and disseminate this history. In addition, this article will explore the debates over objectivity, expertise and authority that were central to discussions over who should write naval history. In doing so, it contributes to a broader historiography that considers the development of the historical profession in the early eighteenth century.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"The Invasion Question: Admiralty plans to defend the British Isles, 1888-1918 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/13581","Morgan-Owen, David Gethin","July 2013","This thesis presents a new analysis of British naval policy before and during the First World War which challenges both orthodox and revisionist interpretations of the period and highlights a highly significant yet much neglected facet of Admiralty planning. It argues that safeguarding the British Isles from invasion was one of the Admiralty’s prime concerns between 1888 and 1918 and that these defensive considerations played a hitherto unappreciated role in shaping British naval strategy. By exploiting source material generally overlooked by previous writers, it demonstrates that, contrary to popular historical belief, Britain’s naval leadership planned extensively to ensure the inviolability of the British coastline during this period. Before 1900, these plans were characterized by relying upon an extensive flotilla of small vessels, supported by a small number of old armoured warships, to secure the position in the Channel and North Sea, while the Navy’s most modern warships focused upon the main French Fleet in the Mediterranean. The Admiralty’s willingness to rely primarily upon flotilla craft for home defence ended after 1900, however, when German displaced France as Britain’s primary naval rival. Germany posed a very different threat to Britain than had previously been the case with France, since it possessed a merchant marine large enough to transport a significant military force without major disruption to the normal operation of its commerce and had her naval forces concentrated in northern waters. Despite the paucity of German planning for the invasion of the United Kingdom, the Admiralty became haunted by the possibility of a ‘surprise’ German invasion attempt, launched before the outset of war and escorted by a strong German Fleet. The Admiralty identified the danger of a surprise German raid or invasion by early 1907 and formed a series of highly secretive plans to deploy the Navy’s most modern armoured warships into the North Sea at the outset of war to meet this danger. These plans were updated constantly between 1910 and 1918 as perceptions of the German threat developed. The nature and extent of these plans has highly significant implications for our understanding of naval policy throughout the period, and for our appreciation of the role of sea power during the First World War.","Navy","University of Exeter"

This article analyses the nature of naval ballads, and investigates their potential political, social and cultural roles. It also studies the language of these ballads, to show how they shaped ideas about the navy, and in turn assess their role in naval recruitment. By considering the social–cultural milieu in which decisions about volunteering took place, it argues that patriotism, duty and identity played an important role in encouraging men to join the navy.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"A Social History of Midshipmen and Quarterdeck Boys in the Royal Navy, 1761-1831. ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/109573","Cavell, Samantha","February 2010","Many senior officers in the Royal Navy of late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries saw the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars as a time of dramatic social change within the officer corps. Naval and civilian commentators alike expressed concern that the virtue of birth had replaced the virtue of merit when it came to the selection of officer recruits, and that the change adversely affected discipline and subordination. This thesis seeks to test the accuracy of these observations, and modern interpretations of them, by determining when and why changes in the social make-up of the corps of “young gentlemen” took place, and the effects of those changes on naval professionalism.  This study asserts that social developments in the navy’s officer corps are most transparent at the entry level. Data on the social backgrounds of more than 4500 midshipmen and quarterdeck boys, from 1761 to 1831, shows that the presence of the social elites among officer aspirants was directly affected by states of war and peace and the popularity of a naval career for well-born sons. While contemporaries saw a growing elitism among officer recruits between 1793 and 1815, the data suggests that the scions of peers and the landed gentry were more prevalent in the peacetime service of 1771 and again after 1815, when the weight of social and political connections again became determining factors in the selection of officer trainees. The cultural changes that influenced the popularity of a naval career for young “honorables” between the Seven Years’ War and Parliamentary Reform highlight the social and political pressures that were exerted on recruiting captains and the Admiralty. Together they help to explain developments in the social make-up of the navy’s future-officer corps and the relationship between the naval microcosm and British society at large.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"The Chilean Naval Mutiny of 1931 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/118008","Tromben Corbalán, Carlos René Manuel","August 2010","On 1st September 1931, the most serious mutiny affecting the Chilean Navy in nearly two centuries of existence broke out. The various books and articles which have examined this subject have used as their sources the local press and the participants´ own stories. Just in a few cases, historians have had access to official documents, because they were seldom published or access was restricted until now. This has led to gross factual mistakes in the existing historiography, leading to questionable interpretations and to the creation of legends still alive in Chile and elsewhere. This thesis discusses these topics. The Chilean Navy has in its archives a collection of 35 volumes (about 9,200 pages) of Courts Martial official documents and proceedings never studied by historians. The author used these sources under a special authorization for academic purposes.  The following theories of the causes of the mutiny commonly expounded by contemporaries and subsequent historians have been researched: a.	Participation of Marxist groups in the origin of the mutiny and exploitation of it.  b.	Participation of the two Chilean populist political groups in the movement’s generation (headed by the former presidents Arturo Alessandri and Carlos Ibáñez)  c.	Army and Navy officers’ participation in politics during 1924 to 1931 and the consequence in the behaviour of the mutineers. Examination has also been made of connections with the mutiny on board HMS Lucia in Devonport in January 1931 which occurred while the Chilean battleship Latorre was being refitted at that port. Months later and being anchored in the port of Coquimbo, Chile, serious mutiny or revolt started on board Latorre and spread to other naval units as well as other Navy’s, Army’s and Air Force’s shore establishments.

"The Navy in the English Civil War ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/4078","Lea-O'Mahoney, Michael James","September 2011","This thesis is concerned chiefly with the military role of sea power during the English Civil War. Parliament’s seizure of the Royal Navy in 1642 is examined in detail, with a discussion of the factors which led to the King’s loss of the fleet and the consequences thereafter. It is concluded that Charles I was outmanoeuvred politically, whilst Parliament’s choice to command the fleet, the Earl of Warwick, far surpassed him in popularity with the common seamen. The thesis then considers the advantages which control of the Navy provided for Parliament throughout the war, determining that the fleet’s protection of London, its ability to supply besieged outposts and its logistical support to Parliamentarian land forces was instrumental in preventing a Royalist victory. Furthermore, it is concluded that Warwick’s astute leadership went some way towards offsetting Parliament’s sporadic neglect of the Navy.  	The thesis demonstrates, however, that Parliament failed to establish the unchallenged command of the seas around the British Isles. This was because of the Royalists’ widespread privateering operations, aided in large part by the King’s capture of key ports in 1643, such as Dartmouth and Bristol. The Navy was able to block many, but not all, of the King’s arms shipments from abroad, thus permitting Charles to supply his armies in England. Close attention is paid to the Royalist shipping which landed reinforcements from Ireland in 1643-44.  	The King’s defeat in the First Civil War is then discussed, with the New Model Army, and greater resources, cited as the key factors behind Parliament’s victory, with recognition that the Navy provided essential support. Finally, the revolt of the fleet in 1648 is examined. It is concluded that the increasing radicalism of Parliament alienated a substantial section of the Navy, but that the Royalists failed to capitalise on their new-found maritime strength.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Ship-shape: materializing leadership in the British Royal Navy ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/17011","Hawkins, Beverley","April 2015","In this article I contribute to posthumanist, actor-network influenced theories of leadership, drawing empirically on qualitative data collected at a Royal Navy shore establishment in Great Britain. I demonstrate how a fluid network of hybridized relationships between people and things affords shifting and multiple possibilities for making leadership matter. As configurations of actants evolve these affordances are altered, and the blackboxing processes hiding the material actants co-generating leadership effects are uncovered. A detailed explication of the politicised affordances within actor networks contributes to knowledge about how hybridized relationships co-enable possibilities for action that bring to life, reinforce, and call into question the human-centred, gendered, colonialist web of assumptions and practices through which Royal Naval personnel understand and enact leadership.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"British Admiralty Control and Naval Power in the Indian Ocean (1793-1815) ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/3919","Day, John Frederick","April 2012","This thesis aims to explain how British naval power was sustained in the Indian Ocean during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. To improve efficiency and economy, the Admiralty had to reorganise the management of shore support services, as well as to rationalise the bases available to the navy to meet the enemy it faced. The basic proposal of this thesis is that British naval power was projected overseas by the Admiralty's effective reconciliation of two competing demands, the naval demand for strategic deployment and the domestic demand for reform.    The thesis argues that British naval power in the Indian Ocean was increased by the acquisition of the Cape of Good Hope and Trincomalee and the naval bases built at these locations. The removal of the navy from complete dependence on the East India Company for support services was part of a long term policy of increasing Admiralty control of facilities in the east. In 1793 Bombay was the main naval base but Madras quickly became another hub supporting naval activities in the east. Other locations were considered. Calcutta was used and investigations were made into developing Penang as a navy base before Trincomalee became part of Britain’s long-term naval infrastructure. At the Cape a separate naval command was given responsibility for part of the Indian Ocean. Following the capture of Mauritius in 1810 this island was used temporarily as a forward support base.  Admiralty control of the naval support services delivered to the squadrons at the Cape and in the East Indies was dramatically improved by the appointment overseas of resident commissioners from 1809. This resulted from the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission of Naval Revision, first suggested by the Commissioners on Fees in 1788. Resident commissioners ensured Admiralty instructions and policies were implemented and executed, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced costs.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Selection and Early Career Education of Executive Officers in the Royal Navy c1902-1939 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/10701","Romans, Elinor Frances","March 2012","This thesis is concerned with the selection and early career education of executive branch officers in the Royal Navy c1902-1939. The thesis attempts to place naval selection and educational policy in context by demonstrating how it was affected by changing naval requirements, external political interference and contemporary educational reform. It also explores the impact of the First World War and the Invergordon mutiny upon officer education. The thesis discusses the selection of potential executive officers, exploring what methods were used, why they were used and how they were developed over time. It discusses the increasing openness of the officer corps of the Royal Navy to boys of talent, irrespective of their background; and shows that this trend was driven by political demand, fuelled by the increasing number of well educated lower middle class boys, and welcomed by many in the Royal Navy. The thesis demonstrates that the Fisher-Selborne Scheme of officer education combined existing naval practice with recent educational developments to produce a unique and innovatory educational system. It shows how many of the assumptions on which the scheme was founded were subsequently proven to be wrong, and demonstrates its gradual dismantling through the inter-war years.  The thesis considers the development of the Special Entry scheme, initially in response to a shortage of junior officers but later as a means of broadening entry to the officer corps. It contrasts the fortunes of the two schemes in the inter-war period, in which the educational side of the Special Entry scheme was largely unaltered. Overall the thesis seeks to place the development of the Royal Navy’s systems for the selection and early career education of executive officers in context by exploring how and why they were developed and their response to the changing fortunes and shape of the Royal Navy.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"‘Stokers-the lowest of the low?'
A Social History of Royal Navy Stokers 1850–1950 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/13844","Chamberlain, Tony","March 2013","‘Stokers-the lowest of the low?' A Social History of Royal Navy Stokers 1850–1950 The introduction of steam propulsion during the early nineteenth century presented the Royal Navy with two interlinked challenges. In the first, steam propulsion had to overcome the sceptics and the challenges of technical development until it proved a reliable and superior alternative to sail. The second was a challenge to the social infrastructure of the Navy which struggled to integrate increasingly large numbers of engine room personnel into a traditional close knit naval hierarchy dominated by seamen. The engineers’ struggle for commissioned status and equality with the executive branch is well documented, as is the history of the engine room artificers’ branch. By comparison, where naval and historical custom has promoted and celebrated the ideal of the Royal Naval ‘bluejacket’ or seaman, its stokers have become subjects of censure while their story has been largely ignored and corrupted by prejudice and myths. Tradition dictates that stokers are portrayed as coarse, uneducated men with a reputation for being trouble makers. As a result, they were judged to have the worst discipline record on the lower-deck. Because of the physical nature of their work and the filth and detritus from the coal they worked with they were also commonly believed to originate from the lowest classes of contemporary society. Yet without stokers no ship could leave harbour let alone engage the enemy. Every item of machinery and equipment onboard a ship relied on the steam produced by stokers. But far from being seen as equals or given any credit for their endeavours in the miniature hell of the stokehole, stokers became social outcasts. No other branch of men in the Navy has been subjected to such longstanding and deep seated censure. The negative stereotypes which surround stokers continue to perpetuate a disservice to a much overlooked and maligned branch of men. In order to determine the reasons why stokers attracted such negative sympathies this thesis will separate the facts from the myths and offer a new perspective on the men condemned by history as ‘the lowest of the low.’","Navy","University of Exeter"
"The Laird Rams: Warships in Transition 1862-1885 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/24286","English, Andrew Ramsey","April 2016","The Laird rams, built from 1862-1865, reflected concepts of naval power in transition from the broadside of multiple guns, to the rotating turret with only a few very heavy pieces of ordnance.  These two ironclads were experiments built around the two new offensive concepts for armoured warships at that time: the ram and the turret.  These sister armourclads were a collection of innovative designs and compromises packed into smaller spaces.  A result of the design leap forward was they suffered from too much, too soon, in too limited a hull area.  The turret ships were designed and built rapidly for a Confederate Navy desperate for effective warships.  As a result of this urgency, the pair of twin turreted armoured rams began as experimental warships and continued in that mode for the next thirty five years.  They were armoured ships built in secrecy, then floated on the Mersey under the gaze of international scrutiny and suddenly purchased by Britain to avoid a war with the United States.  Once purchased, they were largely forgotten.  Historians rarely mention these two sister ironclads and if mentioned at all, they are given short shrift.  Built with funds obtained in part through the Confederate Erlanger loan, these ironclads were constructed at Lairds shipyard in Birkenhead and represented an advanced concept of ironclad construction through new proposals involving turrets, the ram, heavy guns and tripod masts on an armoured ship, as advocated by Captain Cowper Coles, R.N.  They proved too much of a leap in one design but when their roles caught up to the revised designs, the ships were modified to meet new requirements.  After several mission and design changes they then performed to standard. This belated success occurred when the concept of the ideal armoured warship was in flux throughout the middle Victorian years.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Elite Discourse on the Political Economy of the Royal Navy and British Naval Sea Power: New Public Management Theory as  Modernisation - Back to the Future ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/15369","Granfield, Mark Howard","January 2014","At the beginning of the twenty-first century a burgeoning global private military sector is increasingly involved in areas of defence and security that, up until recently, were popularly thought of as being within the monopolistic preserve of the nation state. Finding itself at the vanguard of profound political and economic change, today’s Royal Navy is increasingly reliant on relationships with the private sector that only thirty years ago would have seemed unimaginable to many commentators. As naval shipbuilding, dockyard refitting, logistics, training, and even warship ownership and manning, move from a unitary state to an increasingly self-organising private sector bounded by a differentiated and decentered polity, this thesis is concerned with boundaries of elite discourse on legitimacy in the political economy of Royal Navy and British naval sea power and their implications for New Public Management theory. At its core, the study presents original research into the attitudes of fifty elite opinion formers directly concerned with the discourse of Royal Navy modernisation and profiles their ideational boundaries concerning the political economy of force and violence.   The thesis makes an original contribution to knowledge by presenting empirically and framing theoretically the ways in which elite naval attitudes to the political economy of legitimated force have changed and are evolving. The research is important because it challenges what many commentators have come to believe to be an a priori function of the nation state, namely, the monopoly use of force, with the actual views of those opinion formers who currently hold positions of power and influence in and around one of its core ‘ideal type’ institutions: the Royal Navy. The research is also significant because in attempting to clarify the conceptual boundaries of this elite discourse, it also presents a powerful critique of New Public Management with reference to the problematic dimensions of time, economic complexity and socio-political power.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"The Mid-Eighteenth Century Navy from the Perspective of Captain Thomas Burnett and his Peers ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/120046","McLeod, Anne Byrne","October 2010","This thesis explores the concerns of mid-eighteenth century naval captains through the careers of Captain Thomas Burnett and the cohort of thirty five officers who were posted captain in 1757 soon after the start of the Seven Years' War. A subsidiary cohort, that of the 129 lieutenants who were, like Burnett, first commissioned in 1744 is used as a control against which to measure the statistical worth of the smaller cohort. Examination of the day to day concerns of the captains has been made possible through the rich and varied resource of their letters to the Admiralty, which have hitherto been little used as a source by historians. Despite the formality of these letters not merely the concerns but also the personalities and characters of the writers are vividly conveyed. After tracing the career of Thomas Burnett this thesis examines the 1757 cohort and its progression to the rank of master and commander. At this point the correspondence with the Admiralty begins. The influences, 'interest' and formative experiences behind their appointments are considered. The duties of the mid-eighteenth century captain are outlined, as their relationship with the Admiralty is analysed and the extent to which they were kept under strict Admiralty control by precedent and financial scrutiny is demonstrated. All aspects of manning are shown to dominate the daily concerns of captains. The extent to which 'interest' or chance gave them the opportunity to display their professional expertise and increase their standing within the active naval corps is weighed. Tracking this cohort beyond the war into the years of peace and subsequent wars has revealed the extent to which the timing of being made post captain was crucial and that 'interest' was more significant than merit in accelerating and promoting active careers.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Thinking outside the gundeck: maritime history, the royal navy, and the outbreak of British civil war, 1625-1642 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/14921","Blakemore, Richard J.","January 2014","Maritime history seems to be suffering an identity crisis, rising in popularity but unsure of its place within historical scholarship and divided in approach. Seafarers, as a consequence, have remained marginal within mainstream history. This article argues that only by integrating the study of maritime topics into wider historical debates can maritime history overcome these doubts, taking as a case study the role of seafarers and the navy in British politics during 1625−42. First examining previous interpretations offered by scholars, largely based on a conception of seafarers as politically and socially isolated from developments ashore, the article then reassesses the available evidence for popular political activity within the maritime community. It argues that seafarers were deeply involved in the political and religious divisions that drove Britain into civil war in 1642; and, more broadly, that scholars should recognize the importance of both local and global approaches to maritime history – that they should think outside the gundeck.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"The Health of British Seamen in the West Indies, 1770 - 1806 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/3918","Convertito, Coriann","August 2011","This thesis examines the impact of disease and mortality on the Royal Navy in the West Indies from 1770 to 1806.  It also investigates the navy’s medical branch which was established to manage the care of sick seamen.  Using an interdisciplinary approach, this thesis produces a cohesive understanding of how disease and mortality affected the navy’s presence in the West Indies and the ways in which the navy attempted to mitigate their impact.  This thesis explores various aspects of naval medicine including the history of the Sick and Hurt Board, the diseases which distressed seamen, the medicines distributed by the navy, the key personnel who were integral in generating changes to the medical system and the development of hospital facilities. Largely based on Admiralty records including correspondence and minutes from the Sick and Hurt Board, ships’ muster books and surgeons’ journals, this thesis investigates the most prevalent diseases in the West Indies and the prescribed treatments advocated by the navy.  It then examines how these diseases and treatments affected seamen on board ships in that region through a quantitative analysis; then focuses on a number of the integral naval personnel who ushered in sweeping changes to naval medicine; and explores the navy’s increasing desire to transition from hired sick quarters to purpose-built naval hospitals on various West Indies islands.  It concludes with a case study of the development of Antigua naval hospital which demonstrates the effectiveness of these facilities in convalescing sick seamen. Through a quantitative analysis of ships’ muster books, this thesis argues that the levels of sickness and mortality in the navy in the West Indies during the late eighteenth century are largely exaggerated in historical studies while also discrediting the myth that those islands were the ‘white man’s graveyard’ for many naval personnel.  By surveying over 100,000 seamen on board ships in that region, sickness and mortality figures emerge which indicate that, on average, less than 4 per cent of seamen were on the sick list at any given time and only a small percentage died, meaning that the majority remained on active duty.  This thesis then argues that many of the changes to the navy’s medical system that facilitated such low percentages were primarily instigated by surgeons, physicians and captains who identified beneficial medicines and championed their general distribution among the entire fleet.  By looking at these aspects of naval medicine through a multidisciplinary lens rather than a purely administrative one, it is possible to understand the true state of health of British seamen in the West Indies during the last quarter of the eighteenth century.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"“That most useful body of men”: the Operational Doctrine and Identity of the British Marine Corps, 1755-1802 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/117786","Zerbe, Britt Wyatt","September 2010","The Corps of Marines 1755-1802 (after 1802, Royal Marines) was the smallest of the three military services of the late eighteenth century British Armed Nation.  Because of this, their history has largely been marginalised - or if dealt with, only in broad three hundred year studies.  However, their importance has been largely underestimated.  With the rise in the late eighteenth century of a more coherent ‘Blue-Water Strategy’, classified later by some historians as a uniquely ‘British Way in Warfare’, there was a need to have an operational organisation from which to implement Britain’s grand strategy.  The two other contemporary military organizations (Army and Navy) were too large, had internal resistance to, or simply had one-dimensional geographic identification which prevented the full pure operational implementation of British amphibious power.  With the dawn of the Seven Years War the government gave this operational priority to the Navy, which began in earnest with the formation of the British Marine Corps.  The Navy, and Marines, were able to do this by constructing an operational doctrine and identity for its new Marine Corps.  With the forty-seven year construction of its operational doctrine and identity, the Marines not only assisted in the implementation of British grand strategy, but also were pivotal in the protection of the empire. This dissertation is separated into two distinct parts.  The first part outlines the skeleton of the Marines; their past formations, administration and manpower construct.  The second part outlines the trials and tribulations of construction and institutionalisation of the Marine Corps within the British nation of the late-eighteenth century.  This part reveals the non-combat usage, operational development and imperial rapid reaction force aspects of the Marines.  Marines were to carry out many protection and security related duties on land and at sea.  Because of this they were given direct access to weapons which in the unfortunate event of mutiny might be used against the men.  Naval and amphibious combat were the main justifications for why the Marine Corps existed to begin with.  Marines were to develop their own special ‘targeted’ suppression fire and a reliance on the bayonet for both of these operations.  Importantly Empire; its maintenance, expansion, and protection was an essential element of the Marines existence.   Marines were to become an imperial rapid reaction force that could be sent anywhere a naval ship was and used to suppress disorders.  Identity was the tool of three powers (Public, Admiralty and Marine Corps) in their construction of this body of men.  Marines’ identity allowed them to be relied upon for a multitude of duties, including the basic protection of order on ship.   By understanding all of these areas not only will it expand historical scholarship on how the British state constructed and implemented its policy decisions, but also how an organisation creates and validates its own purpose of existence.","Navy","University of Exeter"

"Admiral Peter Rainier and the Command of the East Indies Station 1794-1805 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/3028","Ward, Peter","September 2010","Admiral Peter Rainier and the Command of the East Indies Station 1794-1805.      Peter Rainier was the longest serving commander on the East Indies station by some margin, and the longest serving commander of any of the navy’s stations in the long Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.   This thesis illustrates the issues that needed to be addressed on this station and considers how successfully Rainier dealt with them. It will also suggest that he remains so little known amongst the pantheon of British admirals of the Napoleonic era because the traditional measure of value of a naval commander is success in battle. Although Rainier had a reputation as a fighting captain, as a commander in chief he saw action only in combined operations. Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that skill other than fighting battles is important. Rainier’s thorough knowledge of the station, his capacity to work with people over whom he had no authority, his ability to protect a rapidly expanding and wealth creating trade, and his administrative and financial professionalism, enabled him to play an important, if secondary, part in the establishment of the Second British Empire which, arguably, had a far greater impact on British history than all but the most seminal battle.  The East Indies Station had a number of unique elements that heavily influenced the actions of its commander in chief. The two-way communication process between Rainier and the Admiralty could take a whole year. Its thirty million plus square mile area meant that communication and logistics within the station needed long term planning. It was still relatively unfamiliar to British navigators, and charting it was still in progress.   The relationship between the admiral and the East India Company, the official government of British India, could make or break the success of both the navy and the Company. With his diplomatic skills and wide experience of the station, Rainier worked with its officials and army commanders to defend current British possessions in the East Indies and India, to extend them to such an extent that, by his return to Britain, they were the foundation of the second British Empire. During this period the centre of power on the station moved eastwards as the value of trade with China overtook that with India – Rainier had to take this into account when allocating his resources. The constraints on navigation and timing caused by the narrow channels in the East Indies and by the weather made it easier for enemy vessels to know by which route the British trade would travel. Rainier had to cover potential threats off Macao, through the Straits of Bali, Banda, Sunda and Malacca, in the Bay of Bengal, off Madras, around Ceylon and between Bombay and the Persian Gulf. When possible he had to cover the French naval base at Mauritius.  With a limited number of vessels,  of which some were always in need of repair, Rainier was often on the defensive. Acquisition of new colonies opened new trading routes which, together with his commitment to trade protection, led to a steady, if often unregulated, expansion in British trade. His attention to detail and his management skills also allowed him to establish an efficient logistics, victualling and financial operation.   What Rainier achieved has to be seen in the context of the complexity of his station and the role of the East India Company. Then it stands far above the level of its absolute achievement. This thesis shows that Rainier’s organization and man management skills, unruffled nature, sound strategic judgement made him a “Safe Pair of Hands”, ideal for such a detached but important command.","Navy","University of Exeter"

"British personnel in the Dutch navy, 1642-1697 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/67714","Little, Andrew Ross","May 2008","An international maritime labour market study, the thesis focuses on the Dutch naval labour market, analysing wartime Zeeland admiralty crews.  The research is based primarily on unique naval pay sources.  Analysis of crew compositions has not been made on this scale in the period before.  The 1667 Dutch Medway Raid is the starting point, where a few British played a leading role – amongst many others reported on the Dutch side.  Pepys and Marvell primarily blamed their joining the enemy on the lure of superior Dutch payment.  The thesis asks how many British there were really, how they came to be in Dutch service, and whether this involvement occurred, as indicated, at other times too.   Part One is thematic and explores the background mechanisms of the maritime environment in detail, determining causation.  First, the two naval recruitment systems are compared and completely reassessed in the light of state intervention in the trade sphere.  Two new sets of ‘control’ data – naval wages and foreign shipping – are amongst the incentives and routes determined.  British expatriate communities are examined as conduits for the supply of naval labour and civilian support.  British personnel are compared and contrasted with other foreigners, against the background of Anglo-Dutch interlinkage and political transition from neutrality through conflict to alliance.  Part Two is chronological, covering four major wars in three chapters.  Micro-case studies assembled from the scattered record streams enable analysis of the crews of particular officers and ships.  Seamen were an occupation that made them a very little known group: the thesis examines the different career types of British personnel of many different ranks, shedding light on their everyday lives.  The thesis shows that British personnel were an integral part of Dutch crews throughout the period, even when the two nations were fighting each other.  The basic need of subsistence labour for employment took precedence over allegiance to nation/ideology, demonstrating limitations in state power and the continual interdependence forced on the maritime powers through the realities of the labour market.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"The Expansion of British Naval Hydrographic Administration, 1808-1829 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/116990","Webb, Adrian James","June 2010","The period from 1808 to 1829, largely neglected by those historians who have looked at the Hydrographic Office, was the crucial formative period for expansion that laid the solid foundations which later Hydrographers could then exploit. The context, achievements and failures of the Admiralty’s hydrographic function, including surveying, chart production, supply, sales and its contribution to the Navy and the scientific world, as an all encompassing beast has been overlooked; the Admiralty placed the responsibility for those tasks on the shoulders of its Hydrographer. Subsequently he determined the success or failure of the office, using his initiative to expand and develop opportunities benefiting the Admiralty, as well as managing a valuable resource of geographical intelligence, fostering links with scientists and the international hydrographic community. The Hydrographer also found himself creating his own policies, serving as Secretary to the Board of Longitude, being a consultant on navigational matters, taking responsibility for the acquisition, supply and maintenance of chronometers for the Navy, as well as being a focal point for issues concerning pay, promotion and manning for surveying specialists. The period from 1808 to 1829 saw many changes, which gave rise to numerous opportunities for expansion. The Admiralty Board and William, Duke of Clarence (as the last Lord High Admiral), both had a direct influence in the way the office expanded, which saw innovation and experimental work become part of the Hydrographer’s routine, especially after the Peace of 1815. But expansion required funding and at a time when internal economy appeared to the be the main objective within the Admiralty, Captain Thomas Hurd managed not only to establish a 100% increase in surveying capacity but laid the foundation for a distinct specialist and professional core of survey officers. His successor, Captain William Parry, despite his absences, overhauled working practices in the office, set standards for surveyors to follow and continued to expand the number of survey ships in commission. Subsequently Captain Francis Beaufort was left the most highly efficient hydrographic office since its foundation in 1795.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Disenchantment and Re-enchantment in the work of William Golding ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/126590","Osborne, B","July 2021","This thesis argues that one of William Golding’s primary motivations in writing his fiction was to reawaken in his readers a sense of the world’s strangeness and mystery. The prevailing view among critics is that the atrocities committed during the Second World War made Golding into a pessimist. Consequently, his novels have been read as allegories of the human condition, with scant regard paid to his daring use of figurative language in his descriptive writing. I argue instead that Golding’s experiences in the navy gave him a renewed appreciation of the natural world’s beauties and terrors, and this fed directly into both his fictional and non-fictional writings. I formulate an analytic framework as an aid to understanding the changes and continuities between the first five novels which Golding published. It shows how his principal characters go through three distinct stages of development: first, the stage of enchantment, a state of dependence and belief in the supernatural; then the stage of disenchantment, a state marked by disillusionment and alienation; finally, the stage of re-enchantment, in which the capacity for wonder is reawakened through an epiphanic vision. This approach to the novels builds off the literary and philosophical context of disenchantment: namely, the view that advances in science and technology have stripped the natural world of its mystery and have stultified the creative imagination. My thesis charts the development of Golding’s early fiction and demonstrates how he became increasingly interested in probing the wellsprings of creativity, which he believed to be connected to a feminine principle in nature. This thesis presents an original assessment of Golding’s work, one which draws on unpublished archival materials and which pays greater attention to his complex use of metaphor, motif, and rhetorical schemes.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Oman's Maritime Doctrine ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/3653","Aljabri, Khamis Salim Sulaiman","June 2012","ABSTRACT The economic and security significance of maritime and political interests around the world has altered with the changing international security environment, as has the importance of secure sea routes to meet global demand. Oman increasingly relies on the sea for maritime trade and exploitation of marine resources, but without a common maritime policy and strategy to align its commercial and maritime interests, its offshore resources will remain under-developed. Oman’s primary interest is to ensure national maritime security by maintaining an effective navy and other agencies to guard its sea areas, and protect its maritime trade. However, it still lacks a formal maritime doctrine to underpin its policies This study argues that a maritime doctrine will assist Oman to utilise its maritime power and protect its national interests. In the absence of archive material, this study has drawn upon personal interviews with maritime experts and practitioners, and reviewed and analyzed a wide range of official publications and secondary sources on maritime policy and doctrine. It highlights the relationship between economic growth and maritime trade in Oman, examines the role of Oman’s shipping industry and related activities, and compares the experiences and expertise of several nations that have established maritime doctrine.  Oman’s need for a maritime doctrine in order to protect its national interests and sovereignty is pressing. It should connect and coordinate its maritime power, military strategy, policies, and standing operating procedures through a single maritime doctrine that will provide the basis for mutual understanding between units of the Sultan’s Armed Forces, related government agencies, and national policy-makers, ensuring operational familiarity and efficiency.

"Securing the Gender Order: Homosexuality and the British Armed Forces ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/3529","Bulmer, Sarah Elizabeth","September 2011","This thesis explores why gender hierarchy remains resilient and entrenched in contemporary political life, despite efforts to challenge and transform it. I approach this question by focussing on the reproduction of gendered subjects, which I argue is integral to the reproduction of what I term ‘gender orders’. This reproduction is interrogated through an analysis of the reproduction of homosexuality in the contemporary British armed forces. A review of the literature in feminist International Relations (IR) shows feminists have engaged with poststructural thought to develop sophisticated analyses of the subject as an effect of power. I argue that there might be further resources in post structural thought which could be mobilised to expose the incompleteness and failure of all attempts to reproduce subjectivity which might open up new ways to intervene and subvert gender.  Drawing on the thought of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Judith Butler I develop a critical methodology for analysing the reproduction of gendered subjects in the contemporary British armed forces. I argue that the military gender order is traditionally sustained through the segregation of women and the exclusion of homosexuals. As such it is pervasively heteronormative. For this reason I argue that the potential ‘integration’ of homosexuals did pose a significant threat to the gender order. However I will argue the threat posed by the integration of LGBT personnel has been neutralised by a series of responses which ‘re-inscribe’ them into the gender order, although these responses are always unstable.  I demonstrate that gender often fails to guarantee the intelligibility it promises, and attempts to order gender necessarily break down. However I will argue that this cannot be exploited instrumentally in order to subvert gender because the gender order is better characterised as being in perpetual crisis, and any attempt to reproduce gender differently will also be unstable and prone to crisis. Consequently critique then becomes a relentless call to question, undermine and deconstruct all attempts to secure political orders, with no guarantees. Ultimately the thesis demonstrates that gender orders are complex, mobile and resilient and argues that modes of feminist critique need to be similarly mobile and responsive to a constantly shifting discursive terrain.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Physical testing of a non-linear active damper developed for offshore renewable energy ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/127468","Khalid, F; Thies, P; Newsam, D; et al.","September 2021","The ambitions of large-scale offshore renewable energy deployment can only be realised if technological and logistical challenges are resolved to reduce the levelised cost of energy. The effective station keeping during device lifetime is a significant challenge that can be addressed through innovation in mooring systems. To increase confidence in the performance of the innovative components and systems prior to field deployment, lab based physical testing must be conducted. The Intelligent Mooring System (IMS) is an innovative non-linear component that is designed to provide active control over the load response of the mooring system to reduce peak loads. To improve the seaworthiness of the system, design changes were made and the resulting IMS is composed of a braided Dyneema sleeve housing an internal accumulator. This paper characterises the static and dynamic load response of the improved design through physical tests conducted at the Dynamic Marine Component test facility. Results indicate that the initial internal pressure is the primary driver of the IMS stiffness profile relative to the water/air ratio. A comparison between the quasi-static and dynamic stiffness characterisation shows that quasi-static stiffness provides a good first-estimate for individual configurations. While the Dyneema fibre displays a hysteretic behaviour for loading and unloading, it improves the strength of the IMS by 47% compared to the previous Vectran build. The presented stiffness curves of the IMS can be used in conjunction with available offshore renewable energy system models to demonstrate the effectiveness of including the IMS in the mooring system to reduce peak loads. Future work includes the field demonstration of a scaled prototype at the U.S. Navy Wave Energy Test Site in Hawaii.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Apatite texture and composition in the Tonglushan porphyry-related skarn system, eastern China: implications for mineral exploration ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/133245","Zhang, F; Williamson, BJ; Broom-Fendley, S","May 2023","The composition of ‘indicator’ minerals is thought to provide a guide to the potential of magmatic arc systems to form porphyry Cu deposits, but whether this is also the case for endoskarn- and exoskarn-dominated systems remains unclear, despite their importance as a source of Cu, Fe and Au. In a first step to address this, we compare the texture, cathodoluminescence (CL) colour and composition of apatite between relatively fresh quartz monzodiorite (QMD) and porphyry-type-, endoskarn- and Fe-(Cu)-mineralised exoskarn components of the Tonglushan porphyry-skarn system of the Daye ore district, China. In the relatively fresh QMD, apatite luminesces yellow-green due to elevated Mn contents. However, where affected by potassic-sodic alteration, it shows green–blue CL thought to reflect partial removal of Mn and an associated increase in REE. Apatite in the endoskarn is more pervasively replaced and veined, and shows mid-blue luminescence due to relatively low Mn, Mg and Cl. The exoskarns contain apatite with variable grain shapes and navy blue-violet or bright to dark blue CL colours, caused by low Mn and elevated Ce, and with only small patches of pale yellow-green CL. Apatite is near absent in the limestone wall rocks and xenoliths and, therefore, where present in the exoskarns is interpreted to have precipitated from the same fluids as the Fe-(Cu) mineralization.  Apatite CL colour and chemistry is indicative of the different styles of alteration and mineralisation in the Tonglushan system and provides insights into the composition of skarn-forming fluids. Our results offer a potentially effective method for utilising apatite as a porphyry and skarn deposit indicator mineral in a range of exploration materials including regolith and stream sediments.","Navy","University of Exeter"

The observation that task experts in many domains exhibit more efficient control of eye gaze than novices has led to the development of gaze training interventions that teach these behaviours. We aimed to extend this literature by i) examining the relative benefits of feed-forward (observing an expert’s eye movements) versus feed-back (observing your own eye movements) training, and ii) automating this training within virtual reality. Serving personnel from the British Army and Royal Navy were randomised to either feed-forward or feed-back training within a virtual reality simulation of a room search and clearance task. Eye movement metrics – including visual search, saccade direction, and entropy – were recorded to quantify the efficiency of visual search behaviours. Feed-forward and feed-back eye movement training produced distinct learning benefits, but both accelerated the development of efficient gaze behaviours. However, we found no evidence that these more efficient search behaviours transferred to better decision making in the room clearance task. Our results suggest integrating eye movement training principles within virtual reality training simulations may be effective, but further work is needed to understand the learning mechanisms.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Ideas about the Economic Advantages of Colonial Maritime War and their Impact on British Politics and Naval Policy, 1701-1729 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/104516","Satsuma, Shinsuke","March 2010","In early modern England (after 1707, Britain), there was an argument that war at sea, especially war in Spanish America, was an ideal means of warfare for England. This argument, whose origin can be traced back to the glorious memory of Elizabethan maritime war, revived at the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession.   This thesis examines this pro-maritime war argument, by focusing on its connection with its supposed economic advantages, and investigates its impact on British politics and naval policy during the war, and changes after the war.   It reveals that this argument received support from politicians of different political stances because of its alleged economic advantages; colonial maritime war was expected to damage enemy financial resources while enriching Britain, and help to recover the Spanish American market where French merchants were making a rapid advance. At the same time, it makes clear that different political affiliations of the supporters created two types of pro-maritime arguments with different political functions.   The thesis also shows that the supporters of colonial maritime war in the government as well as in the opposition tried to implement pro-maritime war policy by naval operations such as capture of Spanish silver fleets and colonial expeditions, and by legislation such as the American Act of 1708. However, their attempts were frustrated by diplomatic considerations, incapacity of naval administration, and by conflicting interests between several groups concerned in the West Indian colonies and Spanish American trade.  After the South Sea expedition planned by the South Sea Company in 1712 did not materialise due to similar difficulties, the government focused on protection of the Spanish American trade, and refrained from taking aggressive action against Spanish colonies partly because of considerations for the interests of the company which started the Asiento trade. On the other hand, by the late 1720s the opposition, which championed the interests of private merchants, gradually came to advocate pro-maritime war policy, which eventually led up to propaganda campaigns against the Walpole ministry in the period of the War of Jenkins’s Ear.","Navy","University of Exeter"

Do they respond primarily to substantive signals in technology announcements, such as AI capabilities, or do rhetorical signals also play a significant role? Adopting signalling theory as a theoretical lens, we conceptualise announcements of AI capabilities as substantive signals and linguistic elements in the announcements pertaining to organisational time horizon and risk- reward considerations as rhetorical signals. Departing from the typical focus on bijective relationships, we consider holistic, complex configurations of interdependent factors using the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) methodology. Notably, announcements pertaining to AI capabilities are not necessarily associated with positive market reactions; in fact, when all three types of AI are included in announcements without explicit consideration of risks, shareholders react negatively. We find that shareholder response is based on joint evaluation of substantive and rhetorical signals, and that these signals interact in a complex way to produce positive and negative market reactions. These findings motivate several propositions for market reactions to IT announcements, providing implications for both theory and practice.","Ai","University of Exeter"

AI enthusiasts forecast that such technologies could improve societal well-being, increase productivity and even provide solutions for global climate and health crises. AI could also help fight human rights abuses. Nonetheless, AI presents a variety of challenges that can profoundly affect the respect for and protection of human rights. • Recently, a profusion of initiatives from a variety of actors spanning from the technology industry to international and regional organizations, academia and civil society, have focused on establishing ethical frameworks for the design and implementation of AI solutions. While these valuable initiatives propose to identify core ethical principles applicable to AI, ethics is only one aspect to be taken into consideration. International Human Rights Law (IHRL) is equally, if not more important. • Stakeholders from the private and public sectors, international organizations and civil society should move beyond the calls for more regulation of AI. Regulation is certainly needed, in particular concerning data protection and privacy. Nonetheless, new models of governance, placed alongside regulatory frameworks and existing human rights instruments, are also needed. This research brief identifies two additional avenues to regulation: public procurement and standardization.","Ai","University of Exeter"

"Access to finance for Artificial Intelligence regulation in the financial services industry ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/120686","Lee, J","November 2020","This paper discusses the design of the legal and regulatory framework for using artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services markets to enhance access to finance (financial inclusion). The author argues that the development of AI should continue to adhere to the regulatory objectives of market safety, consumer protection, and market integrity. However, to ensure equality and fairness, access to finance should be made a clear policy choice. In Part I, the paper discusses how AI can lead to systemic risks and market manipulation on trading platforms. For example, by examining the use of algorithms for trading on the capital market, the author outlines the regulatory objectives and the possible methods of regulation for peerto- peer platforms. In Part II, it discusses how the use of AI to provide consumers with investment advice, such as financial advice provided from robo-advisers, can close the investment advisory gap and provide consumers access to finance. The current regime does not provide adequate protection to financial consumers in this regard. In Part III, the paper focusses how AI can be used as a form of RegTech to streamline compliance processes, thereby increasing competition in financial markets and providing a benefit to consumers. However, this use may be in conflict with privacy, data protection, and ethical concerns. The author makes policy recommendations and suggests some directions for governance in the use of AI in financial services to enhance access to finance. The findings of this paper are relevant to research on the future governance of artificial intelligence in financial services, public policy innovation, and urban development.","Ai","University of Exeter"

"Submission to the UK IPO: Artificial Intelligence and Performers' rights ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/123963","Pavis, M","November 2020","This submission assesses the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems on performers’ rights under UK law, provided by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.   AI systems have introduced ground-breaking changes to the practice of performance synthetisation. Performance synthetisation refers to the manipulation of a performance or performer’s likeness. Performance synthetisation powered by AI (or AI-made performance synthetisation) utilises live or recorded performances protected by performers’ rights as source material.   The Act does not protect performers and other stakeholders against AI-made performance synthetisation because the application of its provisions to this type of activity is unclear. Performers and other stakeholders are thus left exposed by the current intellectual property (IP) framework. This sector of the creative economy is ill-equipped to adapt to the changes brought by AI systems to their industry.  Performance synthetisation created using AI systems raises novel legal questions on the subsistence and infringement framework for performers’ rights. Some of these questions are unique to performers’ rights (as opposed to copyright or other related rights).  AI-made performance synthetisation challenges our intellectual property framework insofar as it is capable of reproducing performances without generating a ‘recording’ or a ‘copy’ of a recording. This technical distinction between the reproduction of a performance, the recording of a performance and the reproduction (or copy) of that recording is important. The Act does not grant protection against unauthorized reproductions of a performance. Instead, the Act controls the recording of a performance, and the copy of that recording.  The current scope of the Act means that performers and other relevant stakeholders are left unprotected against the unauthorised synthetisation of their performances. Without the legal recognition of these rights, performers are also unable to form contracts to authorise the synthetisation of their performance or likeness. As a result, performers are unable to commercialise the synthetisation of their own performance effectively. The legal recognition of these rights is therefore paramount to supporting performers and other relevant stakeholders in adapting to the changes that AI systems will bring to their industry.  For these reasons, UK policy-makers should review the impact of AI systems on performers’ rights, particularly in relation to performance synthetisation. Any review should aim to improve the legal protections for performers and others invested in the making of performances. This reform closes an existing gap in UK law. This reform is the opportunity to establish the UK as a forward-thinking global leader on the legal protection of performers.  This submission was written by Dr Mathilde Pavis (University of Exeter, UK) in response to the call for views on Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property issued by UK Intellectual Property in September 2020.","Ai","University of Exeter"

A specific challenge that remains underexplored is the lack of clear and distinct definitions of the concepts used in and/or produced by these algorithms, and how their real world meaning is translated into machine language and vice versa, how their output is understood by the end user. This ""semantic"" black box adds to the ""mathematical"" black box present in many AI systems in which the underlying ""reasoning"" process is often opaque. In this way, whereas it is often claimed that the use of AI in medical applications will deliver ""objective"" information, the true relevance or meaning to the end-user is frequently obscured. This is highly problematic as AI devices are used not only for diagnostic and decision support by healthcare professionals, but also can be used to deliver information to patients, for example to create visual aids for use in shared decision-making. This paper provides an examination of the range and extent of this problem and its implications, on the basis of cases from the field of intensive care nephrology. We explore how the problematic terminology used in human communication about the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of concepts of intensive care nephrology becomes a much more complicated affair when deployed in the form of algorithmic automation, with implications extending throughout clinical care, affecting norms and practices long considered fundamental to good clinical care.","Ai","University of Exeter"

The work explores six case studies, consisting of different performative experiences of the last decade (2010- 2020) that featured synthetic voice design. It focusses on the political and social impact of synthetic voices, starting from yet challenging the concepts of voice in the machine and voice of the machine. The synthetic voices explored are often playing the role of simulated artificial intelligences, therefore this thesis expands its questions towards technology at large. The analysis of the case studies follows new materialist and posthumanist premises, yet it tries to confute the patriarchal and neoliberal approach towards technological development through feminist and de-colonial approaches, developing a taxonomy for synthetic voices in performance. Chapter 1 introduces terms and explains the taxonomy. Chapter 2 looks at familiar representations of fictional AI. Chapter 3 introduces headphone theatre exploring immersive practices. Chapters 4 and 5 engage with chatbots. Chapter 6 goes in depth exploring Human and Artificial Intelligence interaction, whereas chapter 7 moves slightly towards music production and live art. The body of the thesis includes the work of Pipeline Theatre, Rimini Protokoll, Annie Dorsen, Begüm Erciyas, and Holly Herndon. The analysis is informed by posthumanism, feminism, and performance studies, starting from my own practice as sound designer and singer, looking at aesthetics of reproduction, audience engagement, and voice composition. This thesis has been designed to inspire and provoke practitioners and scholars to explore synthetic voices further, question predominant biases of binarism and acknowledge their importance in redefining technology.","Ai","University of Exeter"

Under periodic heating of the spin system, the relaxation depends on the thickness of the F layer and on the frequency of the thermal source ω. When the thickness of the F layer is much greater than the phonon-magnon scattering length, the magnon temperature dependence on the frequency has two features related to specific characteristic times of the system. One of them determines the dependence in the low-frequency regime and is related to the average phonon escape time from the F layer to the substrate τes. In turn, the high-frequency behavior is determined by the magnon-phonon collisions time τmp. From the latter, the time of phonon-magnon collisions τpm can be found. In contrast, the response of effectively thin F layers is characterized by just one feature, which is determined by the time τmp. Thus, based on the obtained theoretical results, the times τes,τmp, and τpm can be deduced from experiments on the parametric excitation of spin waves by electromagnetic radiation modulated at frequency ω.","Ai","University of Exeter"

We consider several points on this landscape, for example where the coupling between the two coupled two-level systems is dominated by coherent, incoherent, unsymmetrical, and even unidirectional interactions. Traversing the coupling terrain leads to remarkable features in the populations of the pair, correlations, and optical spectra. Most notably, the famous Mollow triplet spectrum for a single atom may be superseded for a pair by a Mollow quintuplet (or even by a spectral singlet) and the setup allows for population trapping to arise, all depending upon the precise nature of the coupling between the two-level systems.","Ai","University of Exeter"

Massive data are being acquired from a fast growing number of IoT devices. Efficient data processing is a necessity to meet diversified and stringent requirements of many emerging IoT applications. Due to the constrained computation and storage resources, IoT devices have resorted to the powerful cloud computing to process their data. However, centralised and remote cloud computing may introduce unacceptable communication delay since its physical location is far away from IoT devices. Edge cloud has been introduced to overcome this issue by moving the cloud in closer proximity to IoT devices. The orchestration and cooperation between the cloud and the edge provides a crucial computing architecture for IoT applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool to enable the intelligent orchestration in this architecture. This paper first introduces such a kind of computing architecture from the perspective of IoT applications. It then investigates the state-of-the-art proposals on AI-powered cloud-edge orchestration for the IoT. Finally, a list of potential research challenges and open issues is provided and discussed, which can provide useful resources for carrying out future research in this area.","Ai","University of Exeter"

The article argues that AI has the potential to support humanitarian actors as they implement a paradigm shift from reactive to anticipatory approaches to humanitarian action. However, it recommends that the existing risks, including those relating to algorithmic bias and data privacy concerns, must be addressed as a priority if AI is to be put at the service of humanitarian action and not to be deployed at the expense of humanitarianism. In doing so, the article contributes to the current debates on whether it is possible to harness the potential of AI for responsible use in humanitarian action.","Ai","University of Exeter"
"Explainability in medicine in an era of AI-based clinical decision support systems ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/131542","Pierce, RL; Van Biesen, W; Van Cauwenberge, D; et al.","September 2022","The combination of ""Big Data"" and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is frequently promoted as having the potential to deliver valuable health benefits when applied to medical decision-making. However, the responsible adoption of AI-based clinical decision support systems faces several challenges at both the individual and societal level. One of the features that has given rise to particular concern is the issue of explainability, since, if the way an algorithm arrived at a particular output is not known (or knowable) to a physician, this may lead to multiple challenges, including an inability to evaluate the merits of the output. This ""opacity"" problem has led to questions about whether physicians are justified in relying on the algorithmic output, with some scholars insisting on the centrality of explainability, while others see no reason to require of AI that which is not required of physicians. We consider that there is merit in both views but find that greater nuance is necessary in order to elucidate the underlying function of explainability in clinical practice and, therefore, its relevance in the context of AI for clinical use. In this paper, we explore explainability by examining what it requires in clinical medicine and draw a distinction between the function of explainability for the current patient versus the future patient. This distinction has implications for what explainability requires in the short and long term. We highlight the role of transparency in explainability, and identify semantic transparency as fundamental to the issue of explainability itself. We argue that, in day-to-day clinical practice, accuracy is sufficient as an ""epistemic warrant"" for clinical decision-making, and that the most compelling reason for requiring explainability in the sense of scientific or causal explanation is the potential for improving future care by building a more robust model of the world. We identify the goal of clinical decision-making as being to deliver the best possible outcome as often as possible, and find-that accuracy is sufficient justification for intervention for today's patient, as long as efforts to uncover scientific explanations continue to improve healthcare for future patients.","Ai","University of Exeter"
"AI and Blockchain Empowered Metaverse for Web 3.0: Vision, Architecture, and Future Directions ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132425","Zhang, X; Min, G; Li, T; et al.","June 2023","As one of the most prominent parts of the Internet, World Wide Web (WWW) has achieved great success and penetrated every area of our lives. However, the current WWW still suffers from inefficiency, growing concerns about user privacy and data ownership, and poor Quality of Experience. Therefore, we propose a promising architecture for the next-generation WWW, Web 3.0, which is underpinned by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain-empowered Metaverse (AIB-Metaverse). Fueled by native AI, Web 3.0 based on AIB-Metaverse can provide users with a personalized experience and enable smart decisionmaking with high efficiency. Backed by Blockchain, the AIB-Metaverse-based Web 3.0 is decentralized, which can help users regain full control of data and protect the ownership of generated data while preserving privacy. Furthermore, this new architecture can provide a ubiquitous immersive experience to users during real-time interaction with digital avatars in the Metaverse. To verify the effectiveness of AI in Web 3.0, we propose an AI-based approach for Metaverse video delivery, which can significantly enhance the quality of immersive experience perceived by users in Web 3.0. In addition, we pinpoint the challenges faced by the proposed AIB-Metaverse-based Web 3.0 and highlight pertinent research directions in the future.","Ai","University of Exeter"
"Platform urbanism and the Chinese smart city: the co-production and territorialisation of Hangzhou City Brain ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/123301","Caprotti, F; Liu, D","November 2020","We analyse an urban platform (Alibaba’s City Brain) to show how smart city development is evolving in urban China. In order to do so, we base our analysis on two strands of literature: that on platform urbanism, and on the experimental city. The paper identifies two processes that are shared across both bodies of work on platform urbanism and experimental cities: relational co-production and territorialisation. These processes can also be applied to the case of City Brain as both a platform and an urban experiment. We conclude by reflecting on the significance of urban platforms on the co-production of data-enabled urban governance; local urban context; and citizenship.","Ai","University of Exeter"
"Taking Words Literally: Cratylism in the Post-Truth Age ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132838","Pragier, D","April 2023","Since 2016, the term “post-truth” has become ubiquitous in news-reporting as a catch-all for the present age: a time of seemingly unprecedented mistrust over public truth, and the deliberate weaponisation of this uncertainty. While the consequences of this state are widely discussed, for example during political election campaigns and global health crises such as COVID-19, a clear understanding of its systemic causes is more tenuous. Consequentially, the post-truth state may even be viewed as a distinctly contemporary phenomenon, for which there is no historical precedent. This thesis rejects such a notion. In its two chapters, ‘truth’ and ‘reality’ are explored as expressions of language and, ultimately, as constructs, ideas which have existed in philosophical and spiritual texts for thousands of years. The study begins with Plato’s Cratylus, and traces a path through history to the 20th century and into the post-truth age. It considers scholars and ideas including Genette’s fallen language, Wittgenstein’s beetle in a box, Benjamin’s sphere of art, Heidegger’s origins of art, Cassirer’s myth of the state, Boorstin’s image state, and Baudrillard’s hyperreality. By doing so, this thesis refutes the notion that the post-truth age exists in isolation by presenting it as the logical development of long-standing debates as to the natures of reality, art, and truth. Further, it considers the ongoing role of writer, across media and form, in investigating these natures, using their works as sites of exercise. As a result of this study, two key conclusions are drawn: (1) our current language system is no longer able to adequately describe its surrounding world; (2) societal misunderstandings as to the nature (or existence) of “objective truth” and “objective reality”, intensified by ever-expanding media systems, will inevitably lead to consequences synonymous with those of “post-truth”. If society wishes to alleviate such consequences of the post-truth age, this thesis suggests that these two root causes must first be addressed.","Ai","University of Exeter"

John Pollard, a ship’s Captain from Newlyn, a prisoner of war in France from 1794-95, kept a journal for a large portion of his time in captivity. Similarly, Captain James Quick was held captive from 1810-14. He wrote a series of letters to his wife in St Mawes detailing his life as a prisoner and his attempts to learn French. Both sources detail links and networks within Cornwall, and the extent to which the men were well-informed as to events within France.","Ai","University of Exeter"
"Satellite observations of cloud regime development: the role of aerosol processes ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/31951","Gryspeerdt, E; Stier, P; Partridge, DG","February 2014","Many different interactions between aerosols and clouds have been postulated, based on correlations between satellite retrieved aerosol and cloud properties. Previous studies highlighted the importance of meteorological covariations to the observed correlations. In this work, we make use of multiple temporally-spaced satellite retrievals to observe the development of cloud regimes. The observation of cloud regime development allows us to account for the influences of cloud fraction (CF) and meteorological factors on the aerosol retrieval. By accounting for the aerosol index (AI)-CF relationship, we reduce the influence of meteorological correlations compared to “snapshot” studies, finding that simple correlations overestimate any aerosol effect on CF by at least a factor of two. We find an increased occurrence of transitions into the stratocumulus regime over ocean with increases in MODIS AI, consistent with the hypothesis that aerosols increase stratocumulus persistence. We also observe an increase in transitions into the deep convective regime over land, consistent with the aerosol invigoration hypothesis. We find changes in the transitions from the shallow cumulus regime in different aerosol environments. The strength of these changes is strongly dependent on Low Troposphere Static Stability and 10 m windspeed, but less so on other meteorological factors. Whilst we have reduced the error due to meteorological and CF effects on the aerosol retrieval, meteorological covariation with the cloud and aerosol properties is harder to remove, so these results likely represent an upper bound on the effect of aerosols on cloud development and CF.","Ai","University of Exeter"

"Thermal evolution and quiescent emission of transiently accreting neutron stars ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/38328","Potekhin, AY; Chugunov, AI; Chabrier, G","September 2019","We study long-term thermal evolution of neutron stars in soft X-ray transients (SXTs), taking the deep crustal heating into account consistently with the changes of the composition of the crust. We collect observational estimates of average accretion rates and thermal luminosities of such neutron stars and compare the theory with observations. We perform simulations of thermal evolution of accreting neutron stars, considering the gradual replacement of the original nonaccreted crust by the reprocessed accreted matter, the neutrino and photon energy losses, and the deep crustal heating due to nuclear reactions in the accreted crust. We test and compare results for different modern theoretical models. We update a compilation of the observational estimates of the thermal luminosities in quiescence and average accretion rates in the SXTs and compare the observational estimates with the theoretical results. Long-term thermal evolution of transiently accreting neutron stars is nonmonotonic. The quasi-equilibrium temperature in quiescence reaches a minimum and then increases toward the final steady state. The quasi-equilibrium thermal luminosity of a neutron star in an SXT can be substantially lower at the minimum than in the final state. This enlarges the range of possibilities for theoretical interpretation of observations of such neutron stars. The updates of the theory and observations leave unchanged the previous conclusions that the direct Urca process operates in relatively cold neutron stars and that an accreted heat-blanketing envelope is likely present in relatively hot neutron stars in the SXTs in quiescence. The results of the comparison of theory with observations favor suppression of the triplet pairing type of nucleon superfluidity in the neutron-star matter.","Ai","University of Exeter"
"Quasichiral interactions between quantum emitters at the nanoscale ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/124213","Downing, CA; Carreño, JCL; Laussy, FP; et al.","February 2019","We present a combined classical and quantum electrodynamics description of the coupling between two circularly polarized quantum emitters held above a metal surface supporting surface plasmons. Depending on their position and their natural frequency, the emitter-emitter interactions evolve from being reciprocal to nonreciprocal, which makes the system a highly tunable platform for chiral coupling at the nanoscale. By relaxing the stringent material and geometrical constraints for chirality, we explore the interplay between coherent and dissipative coupling mechanisms in the system. Thus, we reveal a quasichiral regime in which its quantum optical properties are governed by its subradiant state, giving rise to extremely sharp spectral features and strong photon correlations.","Ai","University of Exeter"
"Public Consultation on Proposed Revisions to Norway’s Gene Technology Act: An Analysis of the Consultation Framing, Stakeholder Concerns, and the Integration of Non-Safety Considerations ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/128797","Kjeldaas, S; Antonsen, T; Hartley, S; et al.","July 2021","In Norway, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are regulated through the Gene Technology Act of 1993, which has received international attention for its inclusion of non-safety considerations. In 2017, the Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board triggered a process to revise the Act that included a public consultation and resulted in the “Proposal for relaxation.” Using post-structuralist discourse analysis, we critically analyze the premises and processes through which the proposal for relaxation was developed—including the public consultation—to understand the range of stakeholder concerns and how these concerns shaped the final proposal. We find that the proposal does not include all concerns equally. The Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board’s privileging of technological matters and its preference for tier-based regulation skewed the proposal in a way that reduced broader societal concerns to technological definitions and marginalized discussion of the social, cultural, and ethical issues raised by new gene technologies. To prevent such narrowing of stakeholder concerns in the future, we propose Latour’s model for political economy as a tool to gauge the openness of consultations for biotechnology regulation.","Ai","University of Exeter"
"Investigation of leaching behaviour of pre-concentrated copper ore using ammonium chloride solution ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/121548","Ambo, AI; Glass, H","May 2020","Investigation of the leaching behaviour of near infrared sensor-based pre-concentrated and classified copper ore samples in ammonium chloride solution was studied to understand the trend in copper extraction. The mineralogical and chemical content of the ore was evaluated using QEMSCAN® and ICMPMS techniques. The effects of leaching parameters such as NH4Cl concentration, particle size, temperature, solid-to-liquid ratio and stirring speed on the leaching were determined. Results mineralogical analysis indicated that the copper bearing mineral in the ore is Chrysocolla with the product containing more copper content than the middling and waste. The middling ranked very high in hematite content than the other fractions while the waste contained significant quartz indicating higher gangue content than the product and middling. Copper extraction and elemental analysis of residue suggested that the rate of copper recovery in the product fraction was more significant than the middling which is in line with the mineralogical and NIR classification of the ore samples. The leaching parameters studied revealed that increasing temperature and NH4Cl concentration with decreasing particle sizes and solid-to-liquid ratio led to increase in the rate of copper extraction up to 86.4 % and 67.3 % in the product and middling groups, respectively. Kinetic analysis revealed the activation energy to be 48.3 kJmol-1 and 71.3k Jmol-1 , this suggests the dependence of the leaching process on surface chemical reaction.","Ai","University of Exeter"

Two realistic methods for creating a temperature gradient in such a heterostructure are considered: by heating the N layer by an electric current and by placing the N/F bilayer between massive dielectrics with different temperatures. The electron temperature Te in the N layer and the magnon temperature Tm in the F layer are calculated. The difference in these temperatures determines the voltage VISHE on the N layer in the Seebeck spin effect regime. The dependence of VISHE on the bath temperature and on the thickness of the N and F layers is compared with the available experimental data.","Ai","University of Exeter"

We apply this test to thermodynamics and derive a set of LeggettGarg inequalities for the statistics of fluctuating work done on a quantum system unitarily driven in time. It is shown that these inequalities can be violated in a driven two-level system, thereby demonstrating that there exists no general macrorealistic description of quantum work. These violations are shown to emerge within the standard Two-Projective-Measurement scheme as well as for alternative definitions of fluctuating work that are based on weak measurement. Our results elucidate the influences of temporal correlations on work extraction in the quantum regime and highlight a key difference between quantum and classical thermodynamics.","Ai","University of Exeter"
"Social pain and social gain in the adolescent brain: A common neural circuitry underlying both positive and negative social evaluation ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/25111","Dalgleish, T; Walsh, N; Mobbs, D; et al.","February 2017","Social interaction inherently involves the subjective evaluation of cues salient to social inclusion and exclusion. Testifying to the importance of such social cues, parts of the neural system dedicated to the detection of physical pain, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI), have been shown to be equally sensitive to the detection of social pain experienced after social exclusion. However, recent work suggests that this dACC-AI matrix may index any socially pertinent information. We directly tested the hypothesis that the dACC-AI would respond to cues of both inclusion and exclusion, using a novel social feedback fMRI paradigm in a population-derived sample of adolescents. We show that the dACC and left AI are commonly activated by feedback cues of inclusion and exclusion. Our findings suggest that theoretical accounts of the dACC-AI network as a neural alarm system restricted within the social domain to the processing of signals of exclusion require significant revision.","Ai","University of Exeter"

Methods We established the Nursing and Artificial Intelligence Leadership (NAIL) Collaborative, comprising interdisciplinary experts in AI development, biomedical ethics, AI in primary care, AI legal aspects, philosophy of AI in health, nursing practice, implementation science, leaders in health informatics practice and international health informatics groups, a representative of patients and the public, and the Chair of the ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health. The NAIL Collaborative convened at a 3‐day invitational think tank in autumn 2019. Activities included a pre‐event survey, expert presentations and working sessions to identify priority areas for action, opportunities and recommendations to address these. In this paper, we summarize the key discussion points and notes from the aforementioned activities.  Implications for nursing Nursing's limited current engagement with discourses on AI and health posts a risk that the profession is not part of the conversations that have potentially significant impacts on nursing practice.  Conclusion There are numerous gaps and a timely need for the nursing profession to be among the leaders and drivers of conversations around AI in health systems.  Impact We outline crucial gaps where focused effort is required for nursing to take a leadership role in shaping AI use in health systems. Three priorities were identified that need to be addressed in the near future: (a) Nurses must understand the relationship between the data they collect and AI technologies they use; (b) Nurses need to be meaningfully involved in all stages of AI: from development to implementation; and (c) There is a substantial untapped and an unexplored potential for nursing to contribute to the development of AI technologies for global health and humanitarian efforts.","Ai","University of Exeter"

"Links between satellite-retrieved aerosol and precipitation ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/31886","Gryspeerdt, E; Stier, P; Partridge, DG","September 2014","Many theories have been proposed detailing how aerosols might impact precipitation, predicting both increases and decreases depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions and aerosol type. In convective clouds, increased aerosol concentrations have been speculated to invigorate convective activity. Previous studies have shown large increases in precipitation with increasing aerosol optical depth, concluding an aerosol effect on precipitation. Our analysis reveals that these studies may have been influenced by cloud effects on the retrieved aerosol, as well as by meteorological covariations.   We use a regime-based approach to separate out different cloud regimes, allowing for the study of aerosol–cloud interactions in individual cloud regimes. We account for the influence of cloud properties on the aerosol retrieval and make use of the diurnal sampling of the TRMM satellite and the TRMM merged precipitation product to investigate the precipitation development.   We find that whilst there is little effect on precipitation at the time of the aerosol retrieval, in the 6 h after the aerosol retrieval, there is an increase in precipitation from cloud in high-aerosol environments, consistent with the invigoration hypothesis. Increases in lightning flash count with increased aerosol are also observed in this period. The invigoration effect appears to be dependent on the cloud-top temperature, with clouds with tops colder than 0 °C showing increases in precipitation at times after the retrieval, as well as increases in wet scavenging. Warm clouds show little change in precipitation development with increasing aerosol, suggesting ice processes are important for the invigoration of precipitation.","Ai","University of Exeter"
