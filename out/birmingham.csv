Using Jessop’s concept of the spatial imaginary, we explore key foundational geographies, trace the emergence of the ‘Silicon Roundabout’ and Tech City concepts between 2008 and 2014, then discuss Tech City’s governance and progress, highlighting both day-to-day challenges and more basic tensions. We contrast this experience with that of ‘Here East’, a new regeneration space across the city in the Olympic Park.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

Using thousands of price quotes from a popular price-comparison website, we find that market fundamentals, such as the number of sellers, median price, share of convenient prices and level of seller stability, are important factors for explaining price stickiness and price dispersion. We demonstrate that calculations of price inflation require conditioning not only on CPU quality, but also on market fundamentals to ensure that CPU attributes are priced correctly. Failing to do so can result in an understatement of CPU price deflation in the sample period.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

Rebranded Tech City, it is the focus of huge public and government attention. National and local policy makers wish to accelerate the local area's development: such cluster policies are back in vogue as part of a reawakened interest in industrial policy. Surprisingly little is known about Tech City's firms or the wider ecosystem, however, and cluster programmes have a high failure rate. We perform a detailed mixed-methods analysis, combining rich enterprise-level data with semistructured interviews. We track firm and employment growth from 1997 to 2010 and identify several distinctive features: branching from creative to digital content industries; street-level sorting of firms; the importance of local amenities and a lack of conventional cluster actors such as universities or anchor businesses. We also argue that the existing policy mix embodies a number of tensions, and suggest areas for improvement. ","Tech","University of Birmingham"

However, returnee CEOs do have a positive impact on firms' innovation performance when they work in publicly owned firms, when they have ties with government agencies, and when their tenure as CEOs is relatively long. The findings have important implications for governments in developing countries that aim to increase their countries' innovation capability through attracting returnees and also for returnee managers who want to contribute to the innovation performance of their firms.

Specifically, this study identifies useful criteria using quantitative word frequency analysis as well as qualitative literature research. Then, cluster analysis is used to divide these criteria into different categories. Subsequently, this study applies the grey theory associated with the DEMATEL method to assess the sustainability performance of high-tech firms.FindingsThe results reveal that the socio-environment is an important aspect underlying the corporate sustainability performance of high-tech firms. Therefore, high-tech firms should enhance their pollution emission control capabilities and increase investment in energy-conservation and emission-reduction technologies to drive sustainable development. In addition, increasing green product sales revenue and improving the guiding capability of green consumption are core issues that firms must address.Originality/valueThis study assesses the sustainability performance of high-tech firms by applying a hybrid method. This method can be used to construct a framework for scientific sustainability performance assessment and to provide a clear direction for the sustainable development of firms.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

We use a unique longitudinal database consisting of 1809 US and European manufacturing and service firms over the period 1990-2008. Our main findings can be summarised as follows. Consistently with previous literature, the knowledge stock has a significant positive impact on a firm's productivity. More interestingly, the coefficient turns out to be significantly larger in the R&D-user services and high-tech manufacturing sectors than in the non-high-tech manufacturing sectors. Contrary to the 'latecomer advantage' approach, these outcomes suggest that firms in high-tech sectors are still ahead in terms of impact on productivity of R&D investments.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

However, is this the case for all types of competition? While recognizing the importance of competition in innovation, we address this question by examining the impact of foreign and domestic competition on the innovation performance of private high-tech new ventures. We argue that the impact of foreign and domestic competition on the innovation performance of local private firms may vary, due to the different types of resource interdependence with their competitors and learning gained by private firms. To test these arguments, we conducted a multilevel analysis of 805 Chinese private high-tech firms over the period 2001–2007. Our findings suggest that foreign competition has a U-shaped relationship with the innovation performance of private firms, whereas competition from state-owned enterprises positively affects private firms’ innovation performance. Our study moves beyond the debate on whether competition increases or decreases innovation by unpacking the differential effects exerted by different types of competitors on the innovation performance of local private firms in the context of a transition economy.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

Within the nascent high-technology global sphere, these female entrepreneurs develop legitimacy for their ventures abroad by accessing external international stakeholders, which leads them to securing much-needed financial and knowledge resources. In addition, their ties with international stakeholders enable them to gain legitimacy among internal Russian stakeholders, thus further enhancing the innovation and performance of their ventures.

Differing from existing studies, our research considers the impact of foreign competition on innovation activities at industry level in a large emerging economy. The results indicate that the intensity of competition from foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) and domestic skill intensity affect industry buy and make activities. Foreign competition is positively associated with the intensity of buy activity, but negatively affects the intensity of make activity. Further, the findings show that domestic skill intensity weakens the impact of foreign competitive pressure on innovation activities.

That is, this research aims to explore and evaluate the drivers that foster agility in international high-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In this regard, building on dynamic capabilities, a total of nine capabilities have been identified that assist high-tech SMEs to become agile in their cross-border activities. Taking advantage of an expert-based method, we relied on Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach to synthesise the opinion of six Italian international entrepreneurs (experts). In doing so, Grey DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (G-DEMATEL) method has been employed to investigate the cause-effect relationship between capabilities and propose conceptual frameworks for agility in international high-tech SMEs. This is followed by the DEMATEL based Analytical Network Process (DANP) to assess the importance and ranking of explored factors. Consequently, the research proposes several theoretical and practical contributions.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

Based on a novel interpretative phenomenological analysis of five Finnish case firms, we found that generational differences between leaders concerning work meaningfulness visibly existed. The differences manifested themselves in the form of different views concerning material well-being, house ownership, freedom, teamwork, and the general approach to working life (being a co-owner and being an employee). At the same time, we found that issues like job security, temporary contracts, part-time work, and gig working needed to be seen more in-depth instead of assuming their generic negative influence on well-being and work meaningfulness. Finally, the findings reveal that change is the name of the game for many millennial and post-millennial high-tech workers, and they may not necessarily associate these aspects negatively with work meaningfulness.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

The data were gathered during 2007-2009 via a cross-sectional survey using a questionnaire on a sample of Israeli high-tech firms that were engaged in acquisitions. Given its global leading role in the high-tech sector, Israel constitutes an important site for the study of mergers in this industrial domain. The findings indicate that synergy potential (similarities and complementarities) between high-tech merging firms, effectiveness of post-acquisition integration, and organizational cultural differences positively influence the overall acquisition performance merging high-tech firms. Moreover, our findings suggest that organizational cultural differences moderate the relationship between effectiveness of post-acquisition integration and overall acquisition performance as such that positive effect of effectiveness of post-acquisition integration is higher when organizational differences are higher. Our findings indicate that organizational cultural differences also positively moderate the relationship between autonomy granted and the overall acquisition performance. An important contribution of the present article is the development of a conceptual framework incorporating the direct and moderating effect of organizational cultural differences and autonomy granted on the overall performance of acquisition.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

This study explores how one such example, home-based sensors with artificial intelligence capabilities, was implemented in English social care to identify changes in behaviour that indicate the onset of potentially more serious issues. Its focus was staff perspectives on decision-making processes and implementation, to inform recommendations for others exploring the potential of new and emerging technology. Qualitative data were collected from 18 semistructured interviews conducted across three sites delivering social care, with senior decision makers, operational leads, and care staff. We identified several issues with the selection process and implementation of AI-based technology in social care, including a lack of consensus around what success would look like, problems identifying and evaluating alternatives, and technical challenges to implementation, as well as obstacles to developing a longer-term, more preventative approach in a system experienced as focused on responding to acute needs. Ultimately, the research confirmed a number of recognised implementation challenges associated with training, resource, and acceptability to staff and patients. It added particular insights around the anxieties experienced by frontline staff and the cultural shift required of preventative interventions in a system geared to meeting acute crises. That many barriers are familiar suggests a particular need to focus on helping policymakers/local leaders avoid similar pitfalls in the future.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

However, a variety of external constraints usually make the successful applications of living CDSA difficult. Herein, such constraints arising from strong hydrogen-bond (H-bond) interactions between unimers that lead to the failure of living CDSA are effectively overcome via reduction of the H-bond strength. In particular, by adding a H-bond disruptor trifluoroethanol (TFE), decreasing the unimer concentration, and reducing the corona segment length, the H-bond strength between unimers could be efficiently alleviated, leading to the formation of uniform two-dimensional (2D) platelets with controlled size and block comicelles with spatially defined corona chemistries. Moreover, by selectively anchoring one-dimensional (1D) seeds on the surface of as-prepared 2D block comicelles through H-bond interaction, the epitaxial growth of a crystalline BCP from immobilized 1D seeds on 2D platelets illustrates competitive growth behavior in a spatially confined environment.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

Specifically, we investigate how and why consumers may transition toward adopting and using new pro-environmental technologies (PETs), namely electric vehicles, solar panels, and a green electricity program. We build a conceptual framework from lifestyle theory, where lifestyle is defined as a grouping of related practices that can reflect and inform the consumer's self-concept (or identity). We apply this framework using a novel quantitative survey method, implemented with a representative sample of 711 San Diego households. Through factor analysis, we identify engagement in pro-environmental practices as independent of engagement in other lifestyle types. We then group respondents into five clusters based on lifestyle engagement, attitudes and openness to lifestyle change (liminality). The three clusters with green attitudes (""greens"") vary substantially by interest in PETs. ""Engaged"" and ""aspiring"" greens are attracted to all three PETs, while ""low-tech"" greens report mild interest in green electricity only. Non-green ""techies"" only report interest in solar panels, while ""traditionalists"" report uniformly low PET interest. Results demonstrate the relevance of lifestyle theory, and provide a unique, empirical application that can improve understandings of opportunities and barriers to sustainable consumption.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

L.","4 Oct 2016","This article contributes to ‘sociology of professions’ theory through the study of changes that occurred in US airline pilots’ work. Findings reveal that airline pilots are quasi-professional experts who developed specialized skills based on talent and experience which allowed them to work autonomously and enjoy a correspondingly high sense of trust and prestige for which they were often well compensated. However, results of this study suggest high labour costs and weak professional communities leave quasi-professional experts vulnerable to managerial cost-cutting and work intensification agendas, particularly during periods of merger, downsizing and other forms of industry restructuring. Findings signal a deprofessionalization of some elite fields in which experts’ specialized skills become devalued and the industry-specific nature of their expertise reduces career options and job mobility. Although the present study identifies this trend in aviation, recent changes in a wide range of industries from healthcare to high-tech portend applicability in a variety of domains.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

Combining a three-wave time-lagged questionnaire survey (Study 1) with a qualitative interview (Study 2) on high-tech entrepreneurial ventures in China, we conclude that technological turbulence weakens the positive association between failure analysis capability and venture goal progress. However, the market knowledge depth of new ventures can be applied to mitigate the negative moderating effect of technological turbulence on the failure analysis capability-venture goal progress association.

An action language is used for the low-level (LL) and high-level (HL) system descriptions in the architecture, and the definition of recorded histories in the HL is expanded to allow prioritized defaults. For any given goal, tentative plans created in the HL using default knowledge and commonsense reasoning are implemented in the LL using probabilistic algorithms, with the corresponding observations used to update the HL history. Tight coupling between the two levels enables automatic selection of relevant variables and generation of suitable action policies in the LL for each HL action, and supports reasoning with violation of defaults, noisy observations and unreliable actions in large and complex domains. The architecture is evaluated in simulation and on physical robots moving objects to specific places in indoor domains; the benefit on robots is a reduction in task execution time of 39% compared with a purely probabilistic, but still hierarchical, approach.

When liquid is drawn up into a capillary and then released under gravity, inertia allows the meniscus to overshoot the equilibrium capillary rise height. The meniscus then rebounds up the tube, again overshooting the equilibrium height and undergoes oscillation. By varying both the immersion depth and radius of the tube, one can observe rich dynamical behavior, with the most dramatic being the formation of a fast liquid jet, barely visible to the naked eye but easily captured with high-speed video. In addition to the flow separation caused by the sudden expansion at the end of the tube, this jet serves as a mechanism of energy dissipation. Some qualitative differences between the works of Quere et al. [""Rebounds in a capillary tube,"" Langmuir 15, 3679-3682 (1999)] and Lorenceau et al. [""Gravitational oscillations of a liquid column in a pipe,"" Phys. Fluids 14(6), 1985-1992 (2002)] and the present experiment are observed and discussed. A critical condition for oscillatory behavior is derived theoretically and matches well with the experimental observation. Once in the oscillatory regime, both the maximum depth below and the maximum rebound height above the equilibrium level are investigated by performing a systematic sweep through the relevant parameter space, incorporating the initial meniscus height, immersion depth, tube radius, and fluid properties. Lastly, the characteristic period of oscillation, tp, is assessed and found to be largely independent of fluid viscosity, and could be reasonably well-collapsed by a single curve whereby tp∼hi, where hi is the tube immersion depth.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

Compared to noncyclic architectures, macrocycles are of significant interest due to their specific “endless” cyclic topology and hence tunable topology-dependent properties. The synthesis of macrocycles with well-defined composition and geometry remains a great challenge, especially for large-sized cyclic rings. Here, we report a successful synthesis of large-sized organometallic macrocycles on the Ag(111) surface via utilizing thiophene-containing molecules, such as 1,3-dibromo-5-hexyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD), as a precursor. The structures of the macrocycles are investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations. The organometallic trans-configured chains and cis-configured (TPD-Ag)n (n = 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20) rings are the main products of an on-surface reaction. By controlling the on-surface reaction pathway, the 18-membered macrocycle can be made as the dominant product of all cyclic configurations. The (TPD-Ag)n macrocycles are realized by the cyclization of organometallic units and occurred on the stage of an intermediate phase. The effects of surface diffusion barriers are further demonstrated by our attempts on Ag(110) and Ag(100) surfaces. The feasibility of such a synthetic method for macrocycles is further proven by the on-surface reaction with Me-TPD precursors.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

I explore these issues using new UK patents microdata and a novel name-classification system. UK minority ethnic inventors are spatially concentrated, as in the USA, but have different characteristics reflecting UK-specific geography and history. I find that the diversity of inventor communities helps raise individual patenting, with suggestive influence of East Asian-origin stars. Majority inventors may benefit from multiplier effects.

A common approach is to include a Gaussian prior, which is defined by a mean vector and a symmetric and positive definite covariance matrix, and to use iterative projection methods to solve the corresponding regularized problem. However, a main challenge for many of these iterative methods is that the prior covariance matrix must be known and fixed (up to a constant) before starting the solution process. In this paper, we develop hybrid projection methods for inverse problems with mixed Gaussian priors where the prior covariance matrix is a convex combination of matrices and the mixing parameter and the regularization parameter do not need to be known in advance. Such scenarios may arise when data is used to generate a sample prior covariance matrix (e.g., in data assimilation) or when different priors are needed to capture different qualities of the solution. The proposed hybrid methods are based on a mixed Golub–Kahan process, which is an extension of the generalized Golub–Kahan bidiagonalization, and a distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that both the regularization parameter and the weighting parameter for the covariance matrix can be estimated automatically during the iterative process. Furthermore, for problems where training data are available, various data-driven covariance matrices (including those based on learned covariance kernels) can be easily incorporated. Numerical examples from tomographic reconstruction demonstrate the potential for these methods.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

The progressive time-depth evolution of the onset of fabric development in deep marine sediments is poorly constrained due to the limited quantity and resolution of existing data. Here we present high-resolution anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) results from clay-rich deep marine sediments recovered at International Ocean Discovery Program Site U1438 (Philippine Sea). AMS is a petrofabric tool sensitive to the preferred orientation of grains in rocks. Down-section variations of AMS parameters, density, porosity and the inclination of magnetic remanences demonstrate that fabrics develop in response to compaction and dewatering but also that they do not develop progressively with depth below the mudline. Instead, a horizontal foliation first forms at 83 mbsf once the sediment load reaches an effective stress threshold for the onset of compaction and is then continuously enhanced down to 113 mbsf, defining a 30 m-thick ‘initial compaction window’. The magnetostratigraphic age model for IODP Site U1438 indicates a delay of 5.7 Ma in initial fabric formation following sediment deposition, with strongly defined fabrics then taking an additional 6.5 Ma to develop.","Marine","University of Birmingham"

We account for this variability using a spatially explicit approach to quantify regional-scale diversity through the Phanerozoic. Among-region variation in diversity is comparable to variation through time, and much of this is explained by environmental factors, particularly the extent of reefs. By contrast, influential hypotheses of diversity change through time, including sustained long-term increases, have little explanatory power. Modeling the spatial structure of the fossil record transforms interpretations of Phanerozoic diversity patterns and their macroevolutionary explanations.

Also described in the paper is a method that has been developed for damping flexural modes of vibration in the receiving structure. This further reduces the levels of vibration by directly tackling the mechanism by which the effect of small forces is amplified.

Based on the virtual work-energy functional of marine risers/pipes, the structural model developed consists of the strain energy due to axial deformation, strain energy due to bending, virtual works due to effective tension and external forces, and also the kinetic energy due to both the riser and the internal fluid motions. Nonlinear equations of motion coupled in axial and transverse displacements are derived through the Hamilton's principle. To analyze the nonlinear free vibrational behaviors, the system formulation has been reformed to the eigenvalue problem. The nonlinear fundamental frequencies and the corresponding numerically exact mode shapes are determined by the modified direct iteration technique incorporating with the inverse iteration. The significant influences of the marine riser's parameters studied on its nonlinear phenomena are then illustrated here first. Those parameters demonstrate the nonlinear effects due to the flexural rigidity, top tensions, internal flow velocities, and static offsets.","Marine","University of Birmingham"

However, the effects of such emissions on marine biogeochemistry remain poorly understood. Here, we collected ship-emitted particles (SEPs) from the stack of a heavy-oil-powered vessel using an onboard emission test system and investigated the impact of SEPs on phytoplankton growth over the northwest Pacific Ocean (NWPO). In SEP microcosm experiments conducted in oceanic zones with different trophic statuses, the phytoplankton response, as indicated by chlorophyll a (Chl a), has been shown to increase with the proportion of SEP-derived nitrogen (N) relative to N stocks (PSN) in baseline seawater, suggesting that SEPs generally promote phytoplankton growth via N fertilisation. Simulations using an air quality model combined with a ship emission inventory further showed that oxidised N (NOx) emissions from shipping contributed ~43% of the atmospheric N deposition flux in the NWPO. Air emissions from shipping (e.g. NOx and sulphur dioxide) also indirectly enhanced the deposition of reduced N that existed in the atmosphere, constituting ~15% of the atmospheric N deposition flux. These results suggest that the impact of airborne ship emissions on atmospheric N deposition is comparable to that of land-based emissions in the NWPO. Based on the ship-induced PSN in surface seawater calculated by modeling results and World Ocean Atlas 2013 nutrient dataset, and the well-established quantitative relationship between Chl a and PSN obtained from microcosm experiments, we found a noticeable change in surface Chl a concentrations due to N deposition derived from marine traffic in the NWPO, particularly in the coastal waters of the Yellow Sea and open oceans. This work attempts to establish a direct link between marine productivity and air emissions from shipping.","Marine","University of Birmingham"

The total chromium concentration in seawater from Southampton Water is 1.85 nM, whereas the Cr content of Argentine Basin samples is 5.8–6.6 nM. The View the MathML source value of seawater from the Argentine Basin is 0.491–0.556‰ in intermediate and deep waters, and varies between 0.412 and 0.664‰ in surface waters (<150 m). The View the MathML source value of Southampton Water seawater is 1.505‰, which may reflect in situ   reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). All of our seawater samples have higher View the MathML source than crustal and mantle silicates, and mass balance modelling demonstrates that river water must also be enriched in heavy Cr isotopes, indicating that Cr isotopes are fractionated during weathering and/or during transport to the oceans.We also show that the Cr isotopic composition of modern non-skeletal marine carbonates (0.640– 0.745‰) encompasses the range that we measure for Argentine Basin seawater. Thus, fractionation of Cr isotopes during precipitation of these marine carbonates is likely to be small (<0.2‰), and they have the potential to provide a record of the Cr isotopic composition of ancient seawater. Phanerozoic carbonates are also characterised by heavy View the MathML source and a correlation between View the MathML source and Ce/Ce⁎ suggests that the Cr and Ce cycles in the ocean are linked.","Marine","University of Birmingham"

The individual wrinkle generations are arranged in nested patterns, where each larger wrinkle resides underneath and represents a scaled-up version of the smaller wrinkle. We present and discuss results from field tests in seawater and laboratory experiments. The results of our held tests reveal that while coatings with Hat topographies foul after relatively short time periods (4-15 weeks), the HWST coatings with the same chemistries as flat coatings remain relatively free of biofouling even after prolonged exposure to seawater (18 months). In contrast to flat coatings, the HWST substrates are not colonized by barnacles. These observations suggest that surface topography plays a dominant role in governing the coating defense against barnacle fouling even without fine-tuning the chemical composition of the overcoat. Laboratory experiments indicate that settlement of zoospores of the green alga Ulva and the strength of attachment of sporelings (young plants) depend on the chemical composition of the coating as well as surface topography.","Marine","University of Birmingham"

They represent a short time interval, perhaps no more than a few years, within a late Middle Pleistocene interglacial. The organic sediments are overlain by unfossiliferous sands and gravels indicating deposition on the floodplain of a braided river under cool or cold climatic conditions. The fossil plant, insect, mollusc and vertebrate remains from the interglacial deposits all indicate climatic conditions with summers warmer than the present in SE England, and winters with a similar thermal climate. The biostratigraphic evidence suggests that the time period represented by the organic unit is part of MIS 9, although the geochronological evidence for such an age is inconclusive. The palaeontological evidence strongly suggests that this temperate stage was warmer than the succeeding temperate stage MIS 7 or the Holocene, and approaching the Ipswichian (Miss 5e) in its warmth. The multidisciplinary description of the Hackney deposits is one of the first to reconstruct terrestrial conditions in Marine Isotope Stage 9 in Western Europe. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It is appealing to recover waste thermal energy to power desalination process. With the fast expansion of the global fleet of liquefied natural gas (LNG) powered vessels and the number of LNG terminals, it is envisaged that LNG cryogenic energy becomes an important form of waste thermal energy apart from engine exhaust. A freshwater generator assisted by LNG cryogenic energy is proposed and investigated in the paper. A semi-dynamic model of the proposed system is used to predict performance and optimal parameters. Feed-in seawater, cooling medium, and configurations of the evaporator and the condenser are three key factors to influence the freshwater production rate and required cryogenic energy. The optimal design is able to provide 1021.7 kg/h freshwater from feed-in seawater of 1296 kg/h and LNG evaporation of 3150 kg/h. A scenario study on an LNG powered cruise ferry predicted that freshwater of 16,991 kg is generated in the 48-hour voyage with the fluctuating LNG cryogenic energy from evaporation, which varies between 212 kW and 973 kW.","Marine","University of Birmingham"

N.","21 Apr 2023","The rigorous assessment of volcanic hazards relies on setting contemporary monitoring observations within an accurate, longer-term geological context. Revealing that geological context requires the detailed fieldwork, mapping and laboratory analysis of the erupted materials. However, many of the world’s most dangerous volcanic systems are located on or near coasts (e.g., the Phlegraean Fields and Vesuvius in Italy), islands (e.g., the volcanic archipelagos of the Pacific, south-east Asia, and Eastern Caribbean), or underwater (e.g., the recently erupting Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai volcano), meaning that much of their erupted material is deposited on the sea bed. The only way to sample this material directly is with seafloor sediment cores. This perspectives paper outlines how marine sediment cores are a vital yet underused resource for assessing volcanic hazards by: (1) outlining the spatio-temporal scope of the marine volcanic record and its main deposit types, (2) providing existing examples where marine sediments have contributed to volcanic hazard assessments; (3) highlighting the Sunda Arc, Indonesia as an example location where marine sediment cores are yet to contribute to hazard assessments, and (4) proposing that marine sediment cores can contribute to our understanding of very large eruptions that have a global impact. Overall, this perspectives paper aims to promote the utility of marine sediment cores in future volcanic hazard assessments, while also providing some basic information to assist researchers who are considering integrating marine sediment cores into their volcanological research.","Marine","University of Birmingham"

In contrast to cells and proteins for which such polysaccharide coatings are known for their antiadhesive properties, marine algal spores and barnacle cyprids were able to colonize the surfaces. Of the three polysaccharides, hyaluronic acid showed the lowest settlement of both Ulva zoopores and barnacles. Photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the polysaccharide coatings tend to bind bivalent ions, such as calcium, from salt water. Such pretreatment with a high salinity medium significantly changes the protein and hematopoietic cell resistance of the surfaces. Complexation of bivalent ions is therefore considered as one reason for the decreased resistance of polysaccharide coatings when applied in the marine environment.","Marine","University of Birmingham"

J.","27 Mar 2017","We present 2 years of NOx observations from the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory located in the tropical Atlantic boundary layer. We find that NOx mixing ratios peak around solar noon (at 20–30 pptV depending on season), which is counter to box model simulations that show a midday minimum due to OH conversion of NO2 to HNO3. Production of NOx via decomposition of organic nitrogen species and the photolysis of HNO3 appear insufficient to provide the observed noontime maximum. A rapid photolysis of nitrate aerosol to produce HONO and NO2, however, is able to simulate the observed diurnal cycle. This would make it the dominant source of NOx at this remote marine boundary layer site, overturning the previous paradigm according to which the transport of organic nitrogen species, such as PAN, is the dominant source. We show that observed mixing ratios (November–December 2015) of HONO at Cape Verde (∼ 3.5 pptV peak at solar noon) are consistent with this route for NOx production. Reactions between the nitrate radical and halogen hydroxides which have been postulated in the literature appear to improve the box model simulation of NOx. This rapid conversion of aerosol phase nitrate to NOx changes our perspective of the NOx cycling chemistry in the tropical marine boundary layer, suggesting a more chemically complex environment than previously thought.","Marine","University of Birmingham"

Two methods based on texture analysis of the satellite imagery are evaluated. Given a map point, the first method extracts information on the surrounding thermal gradient and arranges it as a numerical vector of gradient angles. The second method uses Laws' algorithm to create a vector of numerical measures of structural features. In both the cases, a neural network is trained to recognise those numerical patterns that reveal the presence of eddy structures. Both the algorithms achieve high recognition accuracy and fast and robust learning results. Particularly important are the very low rates of false detections obtained, since eddies occupy only a small portion of the ocean area. Compared to Laws' method, the gradient-based algorithm gives comparable recognition accuracies with a lower design effort and at reduced computational costs. The simple and modular structure of the gradient-based method also compares favorably to the complexity other algorithms for identification of marine phenomena published in the literature. Given the competitive accuracy results obtained, the gradient-based approach may be preferable to the currently employed techniques since it is simpler and more easily reconfigurable.","Marine","University of Birmingham"

Although the HRO literature identifies a number of hallmarks of reliability, less attention is paid to how mindfulness is operationally achieved in situ by individuals on the frontline working in HROs. This study addresses this gap using a multi-phase, multi-method investigation of US Navy SEALs, identifying new links between individual mindfulness attributes (comfort with uncertainty and chaos) and collective mindfulness influences (a positive orientation towards failure) that combine to co-create a phenomenon we call ‘mindfulness in action’. Mindfulness in action occurs when HROs achieve an attentive yet flexible focus capable of incorporating multiple—sometimes competing—realities in order to assess alternative solutions and take action in dynamic situations. By providing a more nuanced conceptualization of the links between individual mindfulness attributes and collective mindfulness influences, this paper opens up new avenues of discovery for a wide range of reliability-seeking organizations.

A number of factors precluded a clear-cut forecast, among the most important of which was the opportunistic and secretive manner in which Japanese leaders formulated their plans. Under the circumstances, the available intelligence could not provide a definite indication of the moves which the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) and Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) would undertake. The situation was further complicated because reliable pieces of evidence revealed Japan did not possess the military and economic resources to defeat a coalition of several Great Powers. The Americans were thus not inclined to expect the Imperial forces to undertake a full-scale conquest of the Asia–Pacific region. The inadequate knowledge of Japanese war plans, in turn, was one of the key factors which led United States defence officials to believe that efforts to bolster their military strength in the Far East were not necessary.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

The simulator was constructed using the Blender open source 3D modelling toolkit and game engine, and featured not only an interactive 3D editor for underwater scenario generation by instructors, but also a real-time, 3D After Action Review (AAR) system for formative assessment and feedback. The simulated scenarios and AAR architecture were based on early human factors observations and briefings conducted at the UK's Defence Diving School (DDS), an organisation that provides basic military diving training for all Royal Navy and Army (Royal Engineers) divers. An experimental pilot study was undertaken to determine whether or not basic navigational and mine detection components of diver performance could be improved as a result of exposing participants to the AAR system, delivered between simulated diving scenarios. The results suggest that the provision of AAR was accompanied by significant performance improvements in the positive identification of simulated underwater ordnance (in contrast to non-ordnance objects) and on participants' description of their location, their immediate in-water or seabed context and their structural condition. Only marginal improvements were found with participants' navigational performance in terms of their deviation accuracies from a pre-programmed expert search path. Overall, this project contributes to the growing corpus of evidence supporting the development of simulators that demonstrate the value of exploiting open source gaming software and the significance of adopting established games design techniques in delivering highly engaging scenarios to defence training communities.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

N.; Guyver, P.; Bishop, J.; Davies, S.; Lundy, J. B.; Bowley, D. M.","2015","BACKGROUND: Anatomic measures of injury burden provide key information for studies of prehospital and in-hospital trauma care. The military version of the Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS(M)] is used to score injuries in deployed military hospitals. Estimates of total trauma burden are derived from this. These scores are used for categorization of patients, assessment of care quality, and research studies. Scoring is normally performed retrospectively from chart review. We compared data recorded in the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry (JTTR) and scores calculated independently at the time of surgery by the operating surgeons to assess the concordance between surgeons and trauma nurse coordinators in assigning injury severity scores.METHODS: Trauma casualties treated at a deployed Role 3 hospital were assigned AIS(M) scores by surgeons between 24 September 2012 and 16 October 2012. JTTR records from the same period were retrieved. The AIS(M), Injury Severity Score (ISS), and New Injury Severity Score (NISS) were compared between datasets.RESULTS: Among 32 matched casualties, 214 injuries were recorded in the JTTR, whereas surgeons noted 212. Percentage agreement for number of injuries was 19%. Surgeons scored 75 injuries as ""serious"" or greater compared with 68 in the JTTR. Percentage agreement for the maximum AIS(M), ISS, and NISS assigned to cases was 66%, 34%, and 28%, respectively, although the distributions of scores were not statistically different (median ISS: surgeons: 20 [interquartile range (IQR), 9-28] versus JTTR: 17.5 [IQR, 9-31.5], p = .7; median NISS: surgeons: 27 [IQR, 12-42] versus JTTR: 25.5 [IQR, 11.5-41], p = .7).CONCLUSION: There are discrepancies in the recording of AIS(M) between surgeons directly involved in the care of trauma casualties and trauma nurse coordinators working by retrospective chart review.

J.; Caird-Daley, A.","1 Dec 2009","A feasibility study commissioned in 1998 by Flag Officer Submarines (FOSM) evaluated the human factors issues of adopting new forms of interactive media to enhance the spatial awareness of safety-critical systems on board Trafalgar Class vessels. The study delivered an early virtual demonstrator that combined simple, real-time 3D models of the main submarine decks and compartments with 360° digital image panoramas of complex, cluttered areas. Digital panoramas were chosen to overcome the huge financial and computational costs of reproducing every pipe, cable, valve and subsystem evident onboard vessels of this class in 3D. More recently, however, hardware and software technologies developed for computer games have proved to be more than capable of delivering quite detailed virtual environments on PC platforms and gaming consoles for non-entertainment applications, at a fraction of the cost than was the case 8 years ago. SubSafe is one such example of what can be achieved using gaming technologies, exploiting freely available, freely distributable software. SubSafe is a proof-of-concept demonstrator that presents end users with an interactive three-dimensional model of part of a typical Naval Base quayside and a Trafalgar Class submarine. The virtual submarine model comprises 3 decks forward of bulkhead 59 (aft of the control room), which accounts for some 35 compartments and over 500 different objects (such as valves, pipes, firefighting and life-saving units, important control panels and so on). This paper presents the background to the SubSafe project and current plans for pilot studies conducted in conjunction with the Royal Navy's Submarine School in Devonport. The studies are investigating knowledge transfer from the classroom to the real submarine (during Week 7 of the students' ""Submarine Qualification Dry"", or SMQ(D) course), together with general usability and interactivity assessments. The paper also briefly considers future extensions into other submarine training domains, including periscope ranging and look-interval assessment skills and the planning and rehearsal of approach and docking procedures for submersible rescue operations.","Navy","University of Birmingham"
"Classifying Vessels Using Broadband Sonar: Considerations for Future Autonomous Support","https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/publications/classifying-vessels-using-broadband-sonar-considerations-for-futu","McCabe, F.; Baber, C.; Stone, B.","Apr 2020","Submarine Command Teams often rely on sensor systems such as sonar to gain situational awareness when operating below periscope depth. Classifying  different vessels using broadband sonar relies on the analysis of aural characteristics to build up a target motion solution for each sonar contact. This process is inherently uncertain, and misclassification can be potentially fatal,resulting in collisions between vessels and submarines. This paper offers suggestions for artificially intelligent support which could be created and provided through the analysis of historically collected information about fishing vessels transmitted via satellite. These suggestions were formedthrough an interview with a subject matter expert and the analysis of a report compiled about a collision that occurred between a Royal Navy submarine and fishing vessel in 2015.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

This allows us to greatly simplify the signal processing that leads to the formation of a bistatic ISAR image. Nevertheless, when such constraints are not fully satisfied some distortions may be introduced. In this paper, such distortions are studied in detail and a reduction of them is proposed that is based on the use of superresolution techniques.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

In a UK context in which policy discourse speaks of ‘military’ methods as an aspiration for the Prison Service but where critical prison scholars use this term more pejoratively, it draws on a unique survey of current and former prison staff to explore the perceived characteristics of ex-military personnel, and the relationship between military service and prison staff culture. The article finds that although some ‘military’ characteristics recall more negative ‘traditional’ cultures, others point towards more professional and compassionate attitudes, challenging the notion that ‘militarism’ necessarily engenders authoritarian and punitive prison regimes.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

This study aimed to evaluate plaque removal efficacy of toothbrushes to guide clinical model development.Methods: This was a single-centre, randomised, controlled, examiner-blind, method development study in 80 healthy participants. Over 28 days, participants brushed twice-daily (1 min) using a fluoride toothpaste and one of four marketed toothbrushes: Toothbrushes A (compact head) and B (regular head): medium-hard; flat trim; end-rounded bristles; Toothbrush C: medium-hard; end-rounded bristles; silky, tapered filaments; compact head; Toothbrush D: soft; tapered filaments; compact head. Supra-gingival plaque removal was evaluated immediately after single brushing events (Days 0, 7, 28, at study centre) and following 7- and 28-days’ home use via Rustogi modified Navy Plaque Index (RPI) and Turesky modified Quigley Hein Plaque Index (TPI).Results: All toothbrushes provided significant plaque removal after single-brushing events (p<.0001, RPI/TPI). Toothbrushes A and B showed significant (p<.05) pre-brushing RPI/TPI plaque reductions after 7- and 28-days use versus Day 0 pre-brushing (except Toothbrush B, Day 28, non-significant TPI). There were no significant differences with Toothbrush C. Toothbrush D TPI was significantly lower at both timepoints versus Day 0 pre-brushing (p<.05). Study toothbrushes were generally well-tolerated.Conclusion: All toothbrushes showed plaque-removal efficacy after single-brushing events and small but increasing reductions in pre-brushing plaque levels over 28 days. Similar trends were observed irrespective of the plaque index employed. These data will inform the design of future clinical studies of plaque removal efficacy using manual toothbrushes.Clinical Significance Statement (50 of 50 words): Regular effective oral hygiene can help prevent and treat gingivitis, principally via twice-daily mechanical cleaning with a toothbrush. Data generated from this methodology development study provides useful information for the design of future clinical studies to assess plaque removal efficacy of manual toothbrushes and generate results to inform clinical recommendations.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

J.","Apr 2009","General Douglas MacArthur remarked that ""old soldiers never die; they just fade away."" For decades, researchers have concluded that visual working memories, like old soldiers, fade away gradually, becoming progressively less precise as they are retained for longer periods of time. However, these conclusions were based on threshold-estimation procedures in which the complete termination of a memory could artifactually produce the appearance of lower precision. Here, we use a recall-based visual working memory paradigm that provides separate measures of the probability that a memory is available and the precision of the memory when it is available. Using this paradigm, we demonstrate that visual working memory representations may be retained for several seconds with little or no loss of precision, but that they may terminate suddenly and completely during this period.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

One aspect of this training relates to their knowledge of the ‘Rules of the Road’ or ‘COLREGS’; the rules for the manoeuvring and signalling that approaching vessels make in order to avoid collision. The training and assessment exercises undertaken predominantly use non-interactive static materials. These do not exercise the required skill in reconciling information from maritime charts, radar displays and ‘out-of-the-window’ monitoring. Consequently, performance during assessment on the VR-based bridge simulator falls short. This paper describes The Rules of the Road SIMulator (RORSIM)—a proof of concept interactive 3D (i3D) simulator developed to bridge the training gap between classroom teaching and VR bridge simulator assessment. RORSIM’s differentiation and its key functionality in terms of visualisaton, physics/interaction and game mechanics are influenced by the consideration of pedagogical learning models during requirements capture. This capture is formalised by a ‘Training Gap Use Case’—a graphical viewpoint using the Universal Modelling Language which can assist developers in requirements capture and development of i3D tools for existing training programmes. Key functionality, initial JWO feedback and a planned pilot study design are reported.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

"Morpho­Semantic Properties of Serbian Nouns: Animacy and Gender Pairs","https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/publications/morphosemantic-properties-of-serbian-nouns-animacy-and-gender-pai","Milin, P.; Radanović, J.","2011","In this study we investigated whether and how the cognitive system uses morphological markedness of animacy and gender pairs. In the Serbian language masculine nouns are marked for animacy (i.e., genitive-accusative syncretism), while for feminine nouns the animacy distinction is purely semantic. Thus, in Experiment 1 we used this natural, linguistic differentiation to test whether morphological markedness of animacy influences lexical processing. In the same experiment, we tested whether the cognitive system is sensitive to the fact that some animate nouns have a sibling in the other gender (e.g., dečak /”boy”/ – devojčica /”girl”/), while others do not have it (e.g., vojnik /”soldier”/ or žirafa /”giraffe”/). We labeled this indicator sibling presence. The analysis did not confirm the effect of animacy, neither between nor within genders. However, animate nouns with a sibling were processed faster than those without a sibling. Since the majority of sibling nouns are morphologically related (like konobar /”waiter”/ – konobarica /”waitress”/), while the rest are not (e.g., petao /”rooster”/ – kokoška /”hen”/), in Experiment 2 we tested whether morphological relatedness contributed to the effect of sibling presence. Results showed that this is not the case: morphologically related and unrelated masculine-feminine pairs of nouns (siblings) were processed equally fast. Furthermore, an interaction between the target’s frequency and the frequency of its sibling was observed: nouns with a more frequent sibling benefited more from their own frequency than those with a less frequent sibling. We argue that sibling support is realized through semantic, not morphological relations. Taken together, our findings suggest that morphological markedness is not used in lexical processing, which is in line with an amorphous approach to lexical processing.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

T.; Stone, R. J.","9 Nov 2009","Scylla is Europe's first artificial reef and was created by the scuttling of a former Royal Navy frigate off the UK coast in Cornwall. As well as being a popular attraction for divers, the colonisation of the reef is of great interest to marine biologists. A recent research programme undertaken by the University of Birmingham in conjunction with the National Marine Aquarium (NMA) has delivered an interactive 3D model of the Scylla. The aim of this program is to promote a greater educational and scientific understanding of the fragility of marine ecosystems. In its current form, the Virtual Scylla exists as a ""kiosk""based exhibit, resulting in only limited handson access by visitors to the NMA. eXtensible 3D (X3D) is a royaltyfree standard which makes it possible to deliver interactive 3D content over the World Wide Web. X3D has previously been used for scientific visualisation in many academic fields. The WebScylla project aims to create an X3D version of the Virtual Scylla which can be delivered over the Web for use as an extensible scientific and educational tool. A web application framework following the ModelViewController (MVC) design pattern is used to rapidly develop a 3D web application to visualise colonisation data relating the Scylla reef which is stored in a relational database. AJAX techniques are used to create a highly interactive and responsive user interface to this application using a hybrid of XHTML and X3D components. It is concluded that MVC frameworks can be a powerful tool for the rapid development of 3D web applications and are particularly suited to datacentric applications. Problems encountered and lessons learned include issues in developing effective user interfaces for visualisation tools using interactive computer graphics and a discussion of some limitations of existing X3D implementations.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

M.; Stetler-Stevenson, M.; Middleton, G.; De Santo, C.; Hassan, R.","30 Mar 2018","PURPOSE: The cross talk between tumour cells, myeloid cells, and T cells play a critical role in tumour pathogenesis and response to immunotherapies. Although the aetiology of mesothelioma is well understood the impact of mesothelioma on the surrounding immune microenvironment is less well studied. In this study the effect of the mesothelioma microenvironment on circulating and infiltrating granulocytes and T cells is investigated.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumour and peripheral blood from mesothelioma patients were evaluated for presence of granulocytes, which were then tested for their T cell suppression. Co-cultures of granulocytes, mesothelioma cells, T cells were used to identify the mechanism of T cell inhibition.RESULTS: Analysis of tumours showed that the mesothelioma microenvironment is enriched in infiltrating granulocytes, which inhibit T cell proliferation and activation. Characterisation of the blood at diagnosis identified similar, circulating, immunosuppressive CD11b+CD15+HLADR- granulocytes at increased frequency compared to healthy controls. Culture of healthy-donor granulocytes with human mesothelioma cells showed that GM-CSF upregulates NOX2 expression and the release of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) from granulocytes, resulting in T cell suppression. Immunohistochemistry and transcriptomic analysis revealed that a majority of mesothelioma tumours express GM-CSF and that higher GM-CSF expression correlated with clinical progression. Blockade of GM-CSF with neutralising antibody, or ROS inhibition, restored T cell proliferation suggesting that targeting of GM-CSF could be of therapeutic benefit in these patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents the mechanism behind the cross-talk between mesothelioma and the immune micro-environment and indicates that targeting GM-CSF could be a novel treatment strategy to augment immunotherapy.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

Results A total of 27 cases (27, eyes, 23, male; median age 26 (range 19-41) years) were identified, of whom 19 cases were evacuated from Iraq alone. Twenty cases were associated with soft contact lens wear. Seven cases were culture positive, of which five grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The overall incidence of CLMK in contact lens wearer in the British military in Iraq was 35 per 10 000. There was an increased incidence during the summer months. Seventeen eyes (63%) lost more than one line of visual acuity with a resultant permanent medical downgrading in duty capability in nine cases.  Conclusions CLMK has a poorer outcome in a deployed military environment when compared to the civilian setting. Increased awareness of the health risks of contact lens wear together with standardised treatment regimens based on improved pathogen detection using molecular diagnostics have improved outcomes.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

However, little is known about predictors of RTW in the military environment.METHODS: A cohort of 194 Royal Air Force (RAF) personnel aged 18-58 who survived primary cancer treatment between 2001 and 2011 were followed up for 18 months. Information was obtained from occupational health and primary care records. Personal, occupational and clinical predictors of RTW were identified by Cox proportional hazards regression.RESULTS: The median sickness absence before RTW was 107 days. Six months after diagnosis 54 % of participants had RTW, and reached 80 % by 12 months. Time taken to RTW was predicted by age at diagnosis, rank, trade group, pre-diagnosis sickness absence, site of cancer, treatment modality, and prognosis. RTW at 18 months were predicted by higher rank (HR = 2.31; 95 % CI 1.46-3.65), and having melanoma (9.75; 4.97-19.13). Those receiving chemotherapy were significantly less likely to have RTW compared to other treatment modalities (0.18; 0.10-0.32).CONCLUSIONS: Rank, cancer diagnostic group, and treatment modality are the most important predictors of RTW in cancer survivors in the RAF.

Physiotherapeutic management has a primary role for patient care, but there is a need to establish the most effective management. Civilian physiotherapists provide the majority of clinical provision throughout the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Programme for British Armed Forces personnel. To date no study has been carried out looking at their perceptions and beliefs with regards to management of non-specific LBP and the potential impact this had on the delivery of rehabilitation across Defence.  Methods: This mixed methods exploratory study aimed to explore the potential complexities surrounding the decision making process with regards to management of non-specific LBP using semi-structured interviews with 14 MOD civilian physiotherapists. All interviews were transcribed verbatim. The transcribed data was then subjected to a categorical content analysis.  Results: The analysis of the interview data revealed four interrelated themes that influence civilian physiotherapists in their management of back pain in military personnel: the military environment, integration of military procedures, physiotherapist treatment approach and communication.  Discussion: This paper highlights the value civilian physiotherapists place on experience when managing non-specific LBP. This experience however was gained through 'patient mileage' rather than integration of best evidence into practice. Several problems were identified in patient management including specific types of patients and their expectations and the importance of the right communication between Health Care Professionals, but also with patients.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

Ten survivors (71%) had an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 75, normally designated as 'unsurvivable'. Most were operated on the day of injury. Seventy-one percent received a reverse question mark incision and 7% received a bicoronal incision. Seventy-nine percent had bone flaps discarded. Overall infection rate was 43%. Acinetobacter spp was the causative organism in 50% of cases. Median Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at final follow-up was 4. All casualties had a GOS score greater than 3.CONCLUSIONS: Timely neurosurgical intervention is imperative for military personnel given high survival rates in those sustaining what are designated 'un-survivable' injuries. Early decompression facilitates safe aeromedical evacuation of casualties. Excellent outcomes validate the UK military trauma system and the stepwise performance gains throughout recent conflicts however trauma registers most evolving to have specific relevance to military casualties. In high-energy trauma with contamination and soft-tissue destruction, surgery should be conducted with regard for future soft tissue reconstruction.

Studies that have clamped the rise in core temperature during exercise (by exercising in cool water) demonstrate a large contribution of the rise in core temperature in the leukocytosis and cytokinaemia of exercise. However, with the exception of lowered stimulated lymphocyte responses after exercise in the heat, and in exertional heat illness patients (core temperature >40°C), recent laboratory studies show a limited effect of exercise in the heat on neutrophil function, monocyte function, natural killer cell activity and mucosal immunity. Therefore, most of the available evidence does not support the contention that exercising in the heat poses a greater threat to immune function (vs thermoneutral conditions).","Navy","University of Birmingham"

Acute HAV infections have occurred in Gurkha soldiers serving in Afghanistan, which made them unfit for duty for 2–3 months. In one case, early serological diagnosis was impeded by IgM results against both HAV and HEV that were caused by cross-reactivity or persistence from a previous infection. These cases have led to a policy change whereby all Gurkha recruits are now tested for previous HAV infection and if negative they are offered vaccination. Meanwhile, HEV infection remains a significant threat in Nepal and Afghanistan with low levels of background immunity and no commercially available vaccine.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

When comparing the two shock absorbing insole 73/ 421 participants (17.3%) randomized to Sorbothane were removed from training because of a qualifying lower limb injury, compared with 76/383 for Poron (19.8%), odds ratio 0.85 (95% Cl 0.58 to 1.23; P=0.37). Conclusions: Similar rates of lower limb injuries were observed for all insoles (shock absorbing and non-shock absorbing) in the trial. The trial provides no support for a change in policy to the use of shock absorbing insoles for military recruits.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

J.; De Brito, S. A.; Sebastian, C. L.; Mechelli, A.; Bird, G.; Kelly, P. A.; Viding, E.","6 Dec 2011","Exposure to family violence affects a significant minority of children: estimates of physical abuse range from 4 to 16%, while intimate partner violence affects between 8 and 25% of children [1]. These maltreatment experiences represent a form of environmental stress that significantly increases risk of later psychopathology, including anxiety 1 and 2. To date, no functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have probed the neural correlates of emotional processing in children exposed to family violence. Previous psychological and electrophysiological studies indicate a selective hypervigilance to angry cues in physically abused children, which is in turn associated with elevated levels of anxiety [3]. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has demonstrated increased reactivity of the anterior insula (AI) and amygdala to angry faces in individuals with anxiety disorder [4], and in psychiatrically healthy soldiers exposed to combat [5], making these regions plausible neural candidates for adaptation to threat. We demonstrated that children exposed to family violence (with normative levels of anxiety) show increased AI and amygdala reactivity in response to angry but not sad faces. While such enhanced reactivity to a biologically salient threat cue may represent an adaptive response to sustained environmental danger, it may also constitute a latent neurobiological risk factor increasing vulnerability to psychopathology.","Navy","University of Birmingham"
"Paediatric traumatic cardiac arrest: the development of an algorithm to guide recognition, management and decisions to terminate resuscitation","https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/publications/paediatric-traumatic-cardiac-arrest-the-development-of-an-algorit","Vassallo, J.; Nutbeam, T.; Rickard, A. C.; Lyttle, M. D.; Scholefield, B.; Maconochie, I. K.; Smith, J. E.","Nov 2018","INTRODUCTION: Paediatric traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) is a high acuity, low frequency event. Traditionally, survival from TCA has been reported as low, with some believing resuscitation is futile. Within the adult population, there is growing evidence to suggest that with early and aggressive correction of reversible causes, survival from TCA may be comparable with that seen from medical out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Key to this survival has been the adoption of a standardised approach to resuscitation. The aim of this study was, by a process of consensus, to develop an algorithm for the management of paediatric TCA for adoption in the UK. METHODS: A modified consensus development meeting of UK experts involved in the management of paediatric TCA was held. Statements discussed at the meeting were drawn from those that did not reach consensus (positive/negative) from a linked three-round online Delphi study. 19 statements relating to the diagnosis, management and futility of paediatric TCA were initially discussed in small groups before each participant anonymously recorded their agreement with the statement using 'yes', 'no' or 'don't know'. In keeping with our Delphi study, consensus was set a priori at 70%. Statements reaching consensus were included in the proposed algorithm. RESULTS: 41 participants attended the meeting. Of the 19 statements discussed, 13 reached positive consensus and were included in the algorithm. A single statement regarding initial rescue breaths reached negative consensus and was excluded. Consensus was not reached for five statements, including the use of vasopressors and thoracotomy for haemorrhage control in blunt trauma. CONCLUSION: In attempt to standardise our approach to the management of paediatric TCA and to improve outcomes, we present the first consensus-based algorithm specific to the paediatric population. While this algorithm was developed for adoption in the UK, it may be applicable to similar healthcare systems internationally.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

Methods A retrospectivecohort of 205 RAF personnel aged 18–58 with cancer diagnosed between 2001 and 2011 was followed-up until May2012. Personal, occupational, and clinical information was extracted from occupational health and primary care records.Predictors of the lifting of (a) employment restrictions on UK duties at 18 months after diagnosis and (b) the lifting of alldeployment restrictions at the end of the study were analysed using logistic and Cox regression models. Results At 18 months,62% of the cancer survivors had restrictions on their UK duties lifted. The positive independent predictors of unrestricted UKduties are testicular cancer (OR5.34; 95% CI 1.21–23.6) and no treatment being required (16.8; 1.11–255.2). The lifting ofall employment restrictions and return to full deployability was achieved by 41% of the participants (median time 2.1 years),with testicular cancer (HR2.69; 95% CI 1.38–5.26) and age at diagnosis (1.05; 1.01–1.09) being the positive independentpredictors of faster lifting of all restrictions. Conclusion Diagnostic group, prognosis and type of treatment are not the onlypredictor of employment outcome after cancer. Patient-centred factors such as smoking, age, fatigue, job status, job typeand length of employment are also important predictors of return to pre-morbid job function in cancer survivors in the RAF.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

C.; Lee, S.; Bartels, S.","22 Feb 2022","Sexual abuse and exploitation (SEA) perpetrated by UN peacekeepers while on mission is a violation of human rights and undermines the goal of upholding human rights in countries that host peacekeeping missions. In addition to survivors, children fathered by peacekeepers are also victims of SEA that need protection. Stigma poses negative life course consequences for SEA survivors and their peacekeeper-fathered children. However, there is a considerable lack of empirical research concerning the stigma experiences of SEA survivors and their children in post-colonial contexts. The present study addresses this knowledge gap by drawing on The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti as a case study to examine the lived experiences of stigma among SEA survivors and their resultant children. Using 18 qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted in 2017 with Haitian women raising peacekeeper-fathered children, we organized qualitative codes according to Link and Phelan’s conceptual model of stigma. The stigmatization process was explored through the themes of labeling, stereotyping, separation, and status loss and discrimination, as described by Link and Phelan. In addition, we nuanced the lived experiences of stigma by discussing the buffering roles of familial acceptance, skin phenotype, and the Haitian context. The findings have implications for the UN. We advocate that stigma be recognized and acted upon as a fundamental protection concern for SEA survivors and their children. Accordingly, the UN has an obligation to provide stigma-related supports for victims and complainants as well as to facilitate long-term child support for the children left behind by peacekeepers.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

These include nosocomially transmitted, often multidrug-resistant pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We analyzed the efficacy of multivalent adhesion molecule (MAM) 7-based anti-adhesion treatment of host cells against aforementioned pathogens in a tissue culture infection model. Herein, we observed that a correlation between two important hallmarks of virulence, attachment and cytotoxicity, could serve as a useful predictor for the success of MAM7-based inhibition against bacterial infections. Initially, we characterized 20 patient isolates (five from each pathogen mentioned above) in terms of genotypic diversity, antimicrobial susceptibility and important hallmarks of pathogenicity (biofilm formation, attachment to and cytotoxicity toward cultured host cells). All isolates displayed a high degree of genotypic diversity, which was also reflected by large strain-to-strain variability in terms of biofilm formation, attachment and cytotoxicity within each group of pathogen. Using non-pathogenic bacteria expressing MAM7 or latex beads coated with recombinant MAM7 for anti-adhesion treatment, we showed a decrease in cytotoxicity, indicating that MAM7 has potential as a prophylactic agent to attenuate infection by multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

However, power as a social dimension is also associated with gender. Here, by means of a reaction-time study and a corpus study, we show that professions that display greater gender asymmetries, such as doctor/nurse, exhibit stronger vertical associations. Moreover, we show that people’s perception of vertical metaphors for power depends on their own gender, with male participants having stronger vertical biases than female participants, which we propose is due to the fact that men are more prone to thinking about power in bodily terms, and to associate it with physical dominance. Our results provide clear evidence for individual differences in metaphor comprehension, thus demonstrating empirically that the same metaphor is understood differently by different people.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

The main purpose of the systematic review was to understand the impact of blast mTBI on PTSD symptom severity. We systematically searched Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase (Ovid), APAPsycINFO (Ovid) and Medline (R) and In-Process, In-Data-Review and Other Non-Indexed Citations (Ovid). Data extraction and quality assessment was completed using the AXIS tool. Statistical analysis was undertaken to determine differences between blast mTBI and the control group (no blast and no TBI in military personnel) and a meta-analysis using the random effects model was used to calculate between-study heterogeneity and variance through I2 and Tau2, respectively. Additionally, the likelihood of PTSD, analysed using the average PTSD Checklist (PCL) score, was also determined based. Statistically higher PCL scores were found in the blast mTBI group compared to control groups, but high heterogeneity was found between the studies (p < 0.001, I2 = 84%, Tau2 = 0.44). Furthermore, all studies reported that blast mTBI had probable PTSD, but this was not the case for the control group. Blast mTBI appears to impact on PTSD symptom severity and the likelihood of developing PTSD, which healthcare professionals need to be aware of. The high heterogeneity present in the studies means that caution must be exercised when interpreting the data from this study. However, future studies require more well-defined, high-quality studies to answer the question of how blast mTBI affects PTSD symptom severity.","Navy","University of Birmingham"
"Can exercise affect immune function to increase susceptibility to infection?","https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/publications/can-exercise-affect-immune-function-to-increase-susceptibility-to","Simpson, R. J.; Campbell, J. P.; Gleeson, M.; Krüger, K.; Nieman, D. C.; Pyne, D. B.; Turner, J. E.; Walsh, N. P.","27 Mar 2020","Multiple studies in humans and animals have demonstrated the profound impact that exercise can have on the immune system. There is a general consensus that regular bouts of short-lasting (i.e. up to 45 minutes) moderate intensity exercise is beneficial for host immune defense, particularly in older adults and people with chronic diseases. In contrast, infection burden is reported to be high among high performance athletes and second only to injury for the number of training days lost during preparation for major sporting events. This has shaped the common view that arduous exercise (i.e. those activities practiced by high performance athletes/ military personnel that greatly exceed recommended physical activity guidelines) can suppress immunity and increase infection risk. However, the idea that exercise per se can suppress immunity and increase infection risk independently of the many other factors (e.g. anxiety, sleep disruption, travel, exposure, nutritional deficits, environmental extremes, etc.) experienced by these populations has recently been challenged. The purpose of this debate article was to solicit opposing arguments centered around this fundamental question in the exercise immunology field: can exercise affect immune function to increase susceptibility to infection. Issues that were contested between the debating groups include: (i) whether or not athletes are more susceptible to infection (mainly of the upper respiratory tract) than the general population; (ii) whether exercise per se is capable of altering immunity to increase infection risk independently of the multiple factors that activate shared immune pathways and are unique to the study populations involved; (iii) the usefulness of certain biomarkers and the interpretation of in vitro and in vivo data to monitor immune health in those who perform arduous exercise; and (iv) the quality of scientific evidence that has been used to substantiate claims for and against the potential negative effects of arduous exercise on immunity and infection risk. A key point of agreement between the groups is that infection susceptibility has a multifactorial underpinning. An issue that remains to be resolved is whether exercise per se is a causative factor of increased infection risk in athletes. This article should provide impetus for more empirical research to unravel the complex questions that surround this contentious issue in the field of exercise immunology.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

Increased rates of alexithymia are observed in multiple psychiatric conditions, and also in neurological conditions resulting from both organic and traumatic brain injury. The presence of alexithymia in these conditions predicts poorer regulation of one's emotions, decreased treatment response, and increased burden on carers. While clinically important, the aetiology of alexithymia is still a matter of debate, with several authors arguing for multiple ‘routes’ to impaired understanding of one's own emotions, which may or may not result in distinct subtypes of alexithymia. While previous studies support the role of impaired interoception (perceiving bodily states) in the development of alexithymia, the current study assessed whether acquired language impairment following traumatic brain injury, and damage to language regions, may also be associated with an increased risk of alexithymia. Within a sample of 129 participants with penetrating brain injury and 33 healthy controls, neuropsychological testing revealed that deficits in a non-emotional language task, object naming, were associated with alexithymia, specifically with difficulty identifying one's own emotions. Both region-of-interest and whole-brain lesion analyses revealed that damage to language regions in the inferior frontal gyrus was associated with the presence of both this language impairment and alexithymia. These results are consistent with a framework for acquired alexithymia that incorporates both interoceptive and language processes, and support the idea that brain injury may result in alexithymia via impairment in any one of a number of more basic processes.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

C.; Carroll, D.; Drayson, M. T.; Batty, G. D.","Feb 2015","BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulins (Ig) are essential for combating infectious disease. However, high levels are associated with a range of diseases and/or poor health behaviours, such as autoimmune diseases, chronic infection, HIV and excessive alcohol consumption. In the present analyses, we extend this body of work by examining whether higher levels of serum Ig G, A and M are associated with increased mortality risk.METHODS: Participants were 4255 Vietnam-era, former US army personnel (the Vietnam Experience Study). From military service files, telephone interviews in 1983 and a medical examination in 1986, sociodemographic, and health data were collected. Contemporary morning fasted blood samples were taken from which IgG, IgA and IgM concentrations were determined. Mortality surveillance over 15 years gave rise to deaths ascribed to all-causes, cardiovascular disease mortality, all cancers combined mortality, external cause and 'other' causes (predominantly comprising deaths due to infectious disease). Cox proportional hazard models were utilised to compute HRs per SD increase in Ig which were first adjusted for age and then additionally adjusting for a range of candidate confounders.RESULTS: In multiply adjusted analyses, in general, the higher the immunoglobulin concentration, the greater the risk of death. Thus, IgA (HR=2.0 95% CI 1.47 to 2.73), IgM (HR=1.5 95% CI 1.11 to 1.91) and IgG (HR=5.8 95% CI 3.38 to 9.95) were positively related to all-cause mortality. Corresponding results for 'other' causes of mortality were 4.7 (2.64 to 8.19), 3.5 (2.29 to 5.45) and 33.4 (15.13 to 73.64).CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, high levels of Ig are associated with an elevated risk of death from total and 'other' causes, mainly infectious disease. High levels of Ig, particularly IgG, may signal subclinical disease.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

J.","Aug 2020","Primary blast injury (caused by the initial rapid increase in pressure following an explosive blast) to the retina and optic nerve (ON) causes progressive visual loss and neurodegeneration. Military personnel are exposed to multiple low-overpressure blast waves, which may be in quick succession, such as during breacher training or in combat. We investigated the necroptotic cell death pathway in the retina in a mouse repeated primary ocular blast injury (rPBI) model using immunohistochemistry. We further evaluated whether intravitreal injections of a potent necroptosis inhibitor, Necrostatin-1s (Nec-1s), protects the retina and ON axons by retinal ganglion cells (RGC) counts, ON axonal counting and optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis of vitreous haze. Receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 3, increased in the inner plexiform layer 2 days post injury (dpi) and persisted until 14 dpi, whilst RIPK1 protein expression did not change after injury. The number of degenerating ON axons was increased at 28 dpi but there was no evidence of a reduction in the number of intact ON axons or RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS)+ RGC in the retina by 28 dpi in animals not receiving any intravitreal injections. But, when intravitreal injections (vehicle or Nec-1s) were given there was a significant reduction in RBPMS+ RGC numbers, suggesting that rPBI with intraocular injections is damaging to RGC. There were fewer RGC lost after Nec-1s than vehicle injection, but there was no effect of Nec-1s or vehicle treatment on the number of degenerating axons. OCT analysis demonstrated no effect of rPBI on vitreous haze, but intravitreal injection combined with rPBI increased vitreous haze (P = 0.004). Whilst necroptosis may be an active cell death signalling pathway after rPBI, its inhibition did not prevent cell death, and intravitreal injections in combination with rPBI increased vitreous inflammation and reduced RBPMS+ RGC numbers, implying intravitreal injection is not an ideal method for drug delivery after rPBI.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

This article reports on a UK study investigating the experience of prison personnel who have previously served in the military and presents the first set of empirical evidence addressing these critical questions. Whilst our findings mirror prevailing assumptions of a relatively seamless transition to post-military careers (and, in particular, those within Protective Service Occupations), few had intended a career in prison work specifically. Such trajectories may influence personal military–civilian transitions, as well as job performance in prison work and, by extension, the everyday lives of prisoners and other prison staff.","Navy","University of Birmingham"

The most common type of LoC-I accident involves a stall/spin and inadequate airspeed management and is frequently cited as a causal factor. An aircraft stalls when the critical angle of attack is exceeded and this may occur at any indicated airspeed, hence the use of airspeed as an indication to the proximity to stall is unreliable. This is of particular importance during the take-off, approach and landing where stall margins are reduced. Military aircraft commonly use angle of attack (AoA) devices to indicate proximity to the stall and these have been in continuous use for almost 60 years. More recently, with the simplification of light airplane design approval requirements, an increasing number of AoA designs are appearing on the market, installed in light airplanes to complement airspeed indication and stall warning systems, to notify pilots of proximity to the stall. This paper reviews a selection of current types of AoA devices and presents the preliminary results of practical flight testing and flight simulation experiments to investigate the effects of using an AoA on pilot performance and workload during selected phases of flight. The results have implications for the operational use of current AoA devices and future AoA design.  ","Navy","University of Birmingham"

C.; Moher, D.; Chan, A-W.; Sydes, M. R.; Calvert, M. J.; Denniston, A. K.","6 Jan 2021","Background The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is an area of immense interest. The high profile of ‘AI in health’ means that there are unusually strong drivers to accelerate the introduction and implementation of innovative AI interventions, which may not be supported by the available evidence, and for which the usual systems of appraisal may not yet be sufficient.   Main text We are beginning to see the emergence of randomised clinical trials evaluating AI interventions in real-world settings. It is imperative that these studies are conducted and reported to the highest standards to enable effective evaluation because they will potentially be a key part of the evidence that is used when deciding whether an AI intervention is sufficiently safe and effective to be approved and commissioned. Minimum reporting guidelines for clinical trial protocols and reports have been instrumental in improving the quality of clinical trials and promoting completeness and transparency of reporting for the evaluation of new health interventions. The current guidelines—SPIRIT and CONSORT—are suited to traditional health interventions but research has revealed that they do not adequately address potential sources of bias specific to AI systems. Examples of elements that require specific reporting include algorithm version and the procedure for acquiring input data. In response, the SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary group of international experts using a consensus building methodological process. The extensions include a number of new items that should be reported in addition to the core items. Each item, where possible, was informed by challenges identified in existing studies of AI systems in health settings.   Conclusion The SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI guidelines provide the first international standards for clinical trials of AI systems. The guidelines are designed to ensure complete and transparent reporting of clinical trial protocols and reports involving AI interventions and have the potential to improve the quality of these clinical trials through improvements in their design and delivery. Their use will help to efficiently identify the safest and most effective AI interventions and commission them with confidence for the benefit of patients and the public.","Ai","University of Birmingham"

AIs are (potentially) not encumbered by these. They are faster, do not tire, have potentially unlimited access to data and while their ability to recognize patterns may not yet be on a par with humans, they are also less likely to fall at least for some forms of deception. As we increasingly rely on AI to make purchasing decisions (recommender systems), communicate our purchase decision to an AI as intermediary Alexa) or even leave it entirely to autonomous agents, a number of difficult questions arise for our trademark regime. The first set of questions centres around the notion of confusion. If a product’s use of an identifying sign would not confuse a human, but might well confuse an AI shopper, is this infringing behaviour? Is the “average consumer” now a consumer that also uses AIs, or should we go even further an include AIs among the group of “average consumers”? Attacks against neural networks can lead to intentional misidentifications of patterns. In addition to possible criminal charges, are there trademark issues in such an attack? Since robots can sense in ways very different to humans, is there an argument to be made that “non-traditional trademarks” will be of increasing importance and in need of more systematic international protection?

Ais are (potentially) not encumbered by these. They are faster, do not tire, have potentially unlimited access to data and while their ability to recognize patterns may not yet be on a par with humans, they are also less likely to fall at least for some forms of deception. As we increasingly rely on AI to make purchasing decisions (recommender systems), communicate our purchase decision to an AI as intermediary Alexa) or even leave it entirely to autonomous agents, a number of difficult questions arise for our trademark regime. The first set of questions centres around the notion of confusion. If a product’s use of an identifying sign would not confuse a human, but might well confuse an AI shopper, is this infringing behaviour? Is the “average consumer” now a consumer that also uses AIs, or should we go even further an include AIs among the group of “average consumers”? Attacks against neural networks can lead to intentional misidentifications of patterns. In addition to possible criminal charges, are there trademark issues in such an attack? Since robots can sense in ways very different to humans, is there an argument to be made that “non-traditional trademarks” will be of increasing importance and in need of more systematic international protection? We will look in particular at the interaction between non-traditional trademarks and attacks against machine learning to elucidate some of the more complex issues that the new technology brings to the regulatory landscape. As AI supported shopping agents can work across national borders, we ask if this too points towards greater need for international harmonization.","Ai","University of Birmingham"

The debate on the use of generative AI is raging and new platforms are appearing quickly, such as GPT4 as a successor of ChatGPT, BingAI, etc. The tension between traditional and innovative forms of assessments, as well as considerations of ethics and integrity, are prominent in day-to-day life of the academics, however, a clear consensus has not yet emerged.We survey module leaders teaching various economics disciplines on their philosophical-pedagogical approach concerning the use of essays as a summative assessment. We present colleagues with a case study from a Microeconomics module, where we ask them to find the needle in the haystack, i.e. identify the answers generated by the AI from the mix of actual students’ scripts. If the distinction was clear, then traditional assessments may still beviewed as an effective tool for evaluating students’ performance. Alternatively, we investigate whether academics consider necessary to propose an assessment re-design in the short run, whether any adjustments to the marking criteria will be made, or whether more structural suggestions are emerging, such as educating students on how to use generative AI as a new tool in an ethical manner.","Ai","University of Birmingham"

AI may yet not have seriously disrupted professional service markets, but with increased commodification of products and services in global law and accountancy firms,these sectors are ripe for change. This may impact the way in which the legal and financial systems operate within countries and across countries thatmay have profound consequences for all in society.AI raises fundamental questions about the reach, limits and appropriateness of current legislative and regulatory frameworks governing their use. There are ethical challenges and risks for professionals, businesses, consumers, governments and nation states. These powerful technologies might be employed to reduce social inequality and improve access to justice, alongsideenhancing productivity and wealth. They may also lead to invasions of privacy, herald an era of greater state or business surveillance of individuals, provide a means for increased authoritarian control and/or greater societal inequality. Lawyers can, and must, play a key role in securing the rule of law, the protection of rights, good governance and fair decision-making in this new context.This paper considers the use of AI systems in legal services and the justice system. It suggests ways in which technology may be harnessed bylawyers and beyond to provide legal help to clients. It touches upon some regulatory and ethical challenges that are yet to be addressed including the powerlessness of jurisdictional boundaries in a virtual age and the powerfulnessof those with access to big data to develop AI in a legal context.The paper also considers, in brief, issues of transparency of decision-making, data quality and inferences drawn from data, professional responsibility and ethics, liability, public acceptance and by implication public trust. Thesediscussions are framed within a discussion of the likely impact that these changes may bring to our legal systems and ways in which the rule of lawmay be strengthened or weakened depending on approaches to regulation of AI technologies and their use.","Ai","University of Birmingham"

J.","Oct 2020","Accurate masses and radii for normal stars derived from observations of detached eclipsing binary stars are of fundamental importance for testing stellar models and may be useful for calibrating free parameters in these model if the masses and radii are sufficiently precise and accurate. We aim to measure precise masses and radii for the stars in the bright eclipsing binary AI Phe, and to quantify the level of systematic error in these estimates. We use several different methods to model the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curve of AI Phe combined with spectroscopic orbits from multiple sources to estimate precisely the stellar masses and radii together with robust error estimates. We find that the agreement between different methods for the light-curve analysis is very good but some methods underestimate the errors on the model parameters. The semi-amplitudes of the spectroscopic orbits derived from spectra obtained with modern echelle spectrographs are consistent to ´ within 0.1 per cent. The masses of the stars in AI Phe are M1 = 1.1938 ± 0.0008 M and M2 = 1.2438 ± 0.0008 M, and the radii are R1 = 1.8050 ± 0.0022 R and R2 = 2.9332 ± 0.0023 R. We conclude that it is possible to measure accurate masses and radii for stars in bright eclipsing binary stars to a precision of 0.2 per cent or better using photometry from TESS and spectroscopy obtained with modern echelle spectrographs. We provide recommendations for publishing masses and radii of ´ eclipsing binary stars at this level of precision. ","Ai","University of Birmingham"

They also need to reflect on how new tools that generative AI brings fit with the broader values and mission of educators, as well as UoB’s mission as a civic university preparing graduates for the future.In this context, we will begin our case study by surveying academics within the BBS on their perception of the impact of generative AI on their teaching and learning practice, with a particular focus on the relative importance of different academic values. Building on the results of this survey, we experiment with different approaches of teaching a selection of skills (taken from the UoB Graduate Attributes list) to our students, focusing on the ethical use of AI in the current environment.

To save computational cost, the present study deals with the dilemma of the performance provided by only a phone-based accelerometer since a wide range of activity recognition projects used more than one sensor. To attain this goal, we derived 1200 min of on-body data from 10 subjects using their phone-based accelerometers. Subsequently, three subtasks have been performed to optimize the performances of the K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Shallow Neural Network (SNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN): (1) During the process of the raw data converted to a 38-handcrafted feature dataset, different window sizes are used, and a comparative analysis is conducted to identify the optimal one; (2) principal component analysis (PCA) is adopted to extract the most dominant information from the 38-feature dataset described to a simpler and smaller size representation providing the benefit of ease of interpreting leading to high accuracy for the models; (3) with the optimal window size and the transformed dataset, the hyper-parameters of each model are tuned to optimal inferring that DNN outperforms the rest three with a testing accuracy of 0.974.

It discusses recent academic literature on the topic to show a problematic entanglement between the promotion of initiatives and prescriptions of what ‘good’ ought to be. In contrast, we call researchers to take a practical and analytical step back. The paper provides a framework for future research by calling for descriptive research on the composition of the initiatives and critical research that draws from broader social science debates on computational techniques. The empirical part of the paper provides first steps towards this direction by positioning Data and AI for Good initiatives as part of a single continuum and situating it within a historical trajectory that has its immediate precursor in ICT for Development initiatives.","Ai","University of Birmingham"

Their world-wide adoptions has been terribly sensational, from light-rail, metro, suburban, highspeed to freight systems. Over the past decades, most focuses in railway operations have been placed on RAMS (reliability, availability, maintainability, safety). Despite the fact that railway is the most environment-friendly mode of transport, its decision-making systems could still be relatively niche, non-interconnected, noninteractive, unsystemics, and perhaps unsustainable. This presentation will highlight recent progress of research and development on the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analytics, and Artificial Intelligence with real-world applications to railway systems. The session will discuss advanced sensor technologies used to collect essential digital data sets in railway systems such as customer experience, passenger safety, mechanical responses, actions, environmental loads and burdens. Recent trends and progress in the applications of machine learning to railway industry will be demonstrated to enhance not only system efficiency or effectiveness, but also sustainable development to its full potential.Short biography: Dr Sakdirat Kaewunruen is a Reader in Railway and Civil Engineering at the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom.

This paper then examines how AI in education systems are being conceived, hyped, and potentially deployed into global education contexts. Findings are categorised into three themes in the discourse: (1) geopolitical dominance through education and technological innovation; (2) creation and expansion of market niches, and (3) managing narratives, perceptions, and norms.","Ai","University of Birmingham"

"Finding light in dark archives: using AI to connect context and content in email","https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/publications/finding-light-in-dark-archives-using-ai-to-connect-context-and-co","Decker, S.; Kirsch, D.; Kuppili Venkata, S.; Nix, A.","Sept 2022","Email archives are important historical resources, but access to such data poses a unique archival challenge and many born-digital collections remain dark, while questions of how they should be effectively made available remain. This paper contributes to the growing interest in preserving access to email by addressing the needs of users, in readiness for when such collections become more widely available. We argue that for the content of email to be meaningfully accessed, the context of email must form part of this access. In exploring this idea, we focus on discovery within large, multi-custodian archives of organisational email, where emails’ network features are particularly apparent. We introduce our prototype search tool, which uses AI-based methods to support user-driven exploration of email. Specifically, we integrate two distinct AI models that generate systematically different types of results, one based upon simple, phrase-matching and the other upon more complex, BERT embeddings. Together, these provide a new pathway to contextual discovery that accounts for the diversity of future archival users, their interests and level of experience.","Ai","University of Birmingham"
"Towards an equitable digital society: artificial intelligence (AI) and corporate digital responsibility (CDR)","https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/publications/towards-an-equitable-digital-society-artificial-intelligence-ai-a","Elliott, K.; Price, R.; Shaw, P.; Spiliotopoulos, T.; Ng, M.; Coopamootoo, K.; van Moorsel, A.","14 Jun 2021","In the digital era, we witness the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to solve problems, while improving productivity and efficiency. Yet, inevitably costs are involved with delegating power to algorithmically based systems, some of whose workings are opaque and unobservable and thus termed the “black box”. Central to understanding the “black box” is to acknowledge that the algorithm is not mendaciously undertaking this action; it is simply using the recombination afforded to scaled computable machine learning algorithms. But an algorithm with arbitrary precision can easily reconstruct those characteristics and make life-changing decisions, particularly in financial services (credit scoring, risk assessment, etc.), and it could be difficult to reconstruct, if this was done in a fair manner reflecting the values of society. If we permit AI to make life-changing decisions, what are the opportunity costs, data trade-offs, and implications for social, economic, technical, legal, and environmental systems? We find that over 160 ethical AI principles exist, advocating organisations to act responsibly to avoid causing digital societal harms. This maelstrom of guidance, none of which is compulsory, serves to confuse, as opposed to guide. We need to think carefully about how we implement these algorithms, the delegation of decisions and data usage, in the absence of human oversight and AI governance. The paper seeks to harmonise and align approaches, illustrating the opportunities and threats of AI, while raising awareness of Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR) as a potential collaborative mechanism to demystify governance complexity and to establish an equitable digital society.","Ai","University of Birmingham"
"Reporting guidelines for clinical trial reports for interventions involving artificial intelligence: the CONSORT-AI extension","https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/publications/reporting-guidelines-for-clinical-trial-reports-for-interventions-2","The SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI Working Group","9 Sept 2020","The CONSORT 2010 (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomised trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency when evaluating new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI. Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process, involving a literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a 2-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items, which were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions, that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human-AI interaction and providing analysis of error cases.CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer-reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes.","Ai","University of Birmingham"
