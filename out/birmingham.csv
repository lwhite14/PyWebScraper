"Quality and price setting of high-tech goods","https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/publications/quality-and-price-setting-of-high-tech-goods","Gorodnichenko, Y.; Talavera, O.; Vu, N.","May 2021","This paper investigates the link between product quality and price setting for central processing units (CPUs). Using thousands of price quotes from a popular price-comparison website, we find that market fundamentals, such as the number of sellers, median price, share of convenient prices and level of seller stability, are important factors for explaining price stickiness and price dispersion. We demonstrate that calculations of price inflation require conditioning not only on CPU quality, but also on market fundamentals to ensure that CPU attributes are priced correctly. Failing to do so can result in an understatement of CPU price deflation in the sample period.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

We site place branding in a larger family of policies that develop spatial imaginaries and specify affordances and constraints on place brands and brand-led strategies. Using mixed methods over a long timeframe, we analyse Tech City's emergence and the overlapping, competing narratives that preceded and succeeded it, highlighting day-to-day challenges and more basic tensions. While a strong brand has developed, we cast doubt on claims that policy has had a catalytic effect, at least in the ways originally intended.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

We use a unique longitudinal database consisting of 1809 US and European manufacturing and service firms over the period 1990-2008. Our main findings can be summarised as follows. Consistently with previous literature, the knowledge stock has a significant positive impact on a firm's productivity. More interestingly, the coefficient turns out to be significantly larger in the R&D-user services and high-tech manufacturing sectors than in the non-high-tech manufacturing sectors. Contrary to the 'latecomer advantage' approach, these outcomes suggest that firms in high-tech sectors are still ahead in terms of impact on productivity of R&D investments.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

Rebranded Tech City, it is the focus of huge public and government attention. National and local policy makers wish to accelerate the local area's development: such cluster policies are back in vogue as part of a reawakened interest in industrial policy. Surprisingly little is known about Tech City's firms or the wider ecosystem, however, and cluster programmes have a high failure rate. We perform a detailed mixed-methods analysis, combining rich enterprise-level data with semistructured interviews. We track firm and employment growth from 1997 to 2010 and identify several distinctive features: branching from creative to digital content industries; street-level sorting of firms; the importance of local amenities and a lack of conventional cluster actors such as universities or anchor businesses. We also argue that the existing policy mix embodies a number of tensions, and suggest areas for improvement. ","Tech","University of Birmingham"

However, is this the case for all types of competition? While recognizing the importance of competition in innovation, we address this question by examining the impact of foreign and domestic competition on the innovation performance of private high-tech new ventures. We argue that the impact of foreign and domestic competition on the innovation performance of local private firms may vary, due to the different types of resource interdependence with their competitors and learning gained by private firms. To test these arguments, we conducted a multilevel analysis of 805 Chinese private high-tech firms over the period 2001–2007. Our findings suggest that foreign competition has a U-shaped relationship with the innovation performance of private firms, whereas competition from state-owned enterprises positively affects private firms’ innovation performance. Our study moves beyond the debate on whether competition increases or decreases innovation by unpacking the differential effects exerted by different types of competitors on the innovation performance of local private firms in the context of a transition economy.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

However, returnee CEOs do have a positive impact on firms' innovation performance when they work in publicly owned firms, when they have ties with government agencies, and when their tenure as CEOs is relatively long. The findings have important implications for governments in developing countries that aim to increase their countries' innovation capability through attracting returnees and also for returnee managers who want to contribute to the innovation performance of their firms.

Specifically, this study identifies useful criteria using quantitative word frequency analysis as well as qualitative literature research. Then, cluster analysis is used to divide these criteria into different categories. Subsequently, this study applies the grey theory associated with the DEMATEL method to assess the sustainability performance of high-tech firms.FindingsThe results reveal that the socio-environment is an important aspect underlying the corporate sustainability performance of high-tech firms. Therefore, high-tech firms should enhance their pollution emission control capabilities and increase investment in energy-conservation and emission-reduction technologies to drive sustainable development. In addition, increasing green product sales revenue and improving the guiding capability of green consumption are core issues that firms must address.Originality/valueThis study assesses the sustainability performance of high-tech firms by applying a hybrid method. This method can be used to construct a framework for scientific sustainability performance assessment and to provide a clear direction for the sustainable development of firms.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

In this regard, building on dynamic capabilities, a total of nine capabilities have been identified that assist high-tech SMEs to become agile in their cross-border activities. Taking advantage of an expert-based method, we relied on Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach to synthesise the opinion of six Italian international entrepreneurs (experts). In doing so, Grey DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (G-DEMATEL) method has been employed to investigate the cause-effect relationship between capabilities and propose conceptual frameworks for agility in international high-tech SMEs. This is followed by the DEMATEL based Analytical Network Process (DANP) to assess the importance and ranking of explored factors.

Within the nascent high-technology global sphere, these female entrepreneurs develop legitimacy for their ventures abroad by accessing external international stakeholders, which leads them to securing much-needed financial and knowledge resources. In addition, their ties with international stakeholders enable them to gain legitimacy among internal Russian stakeholders, thus further enhancing the innovation and performance of their ventures.

Differing from existing studies, our research considers the impact of foreign competition on innovation activities at industry level in a large emerging economy. The results indicate that the intensity of competition from foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) and domestic skill intensity affect industry buy and make activities. Foreign competition is positively associated with the intensity of buy activity, but negatively affects the intensity of make activity. Further, the findings show that domestic skill intensity weakens the impact of foreign competitive pressure on innovation activities.

The data were gathered during 2007-2009 via a cross-sectional survey using a questionnaire on a sample of Israeli high-tech firms that were engaged in acquisitions. Given its global leading role in the high-tech sector, Israel constitutes an important site for the study of mergers in this industrial domain. The findings indicate that synergy potential (similarities and complementarities) between high-tech merging firms, effectiveness of post-acquisition integration, and organizational cultural differences positively influence the overall acquisition performance merging high-tech firms. Moreover, our findings suggest that organizational cultural differences moderate the relationship between effectiveness of post-acquisition integration and overall acquisition performance as such that positive effect of effectiveness of post-acquisition integration is higher when organizational differences are higher. Our findings indicate that organizational cultural differences also positively moderate the relationship between autonomy granted and the overall acquisition performance. An important contribution of the present article is the development of a conceptual framework incorporating the direct and moderating effect of organizational cultural differences and autonomy granted on the overall performance of acquisition.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

Based on a novel interpretative phenomenological analysis of five Finnish case firms, we found that generational differences between leaders concerning work meaningfulness visibly existed. The differences manifested themselves in the form of different views concerning material well-being, house ownership, freedom, teamwork, and the general approach to working life (being a co-owner and being an employee). At the same time, we found that issues like job security, temporary contracts, part-time work, and gig working needed to be seen more in-depth instead of assuming their generic negative influence on well-being and work meaningfulness. Finally, the findings reveal that change is the name of the game for many millennial and post-millennial high-tech workers, and they may not necessarily associate these aspects negatively with work meaningfulness.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

However, a variety of external constraints usually make the successful applications of living CDSA difficult. Herein, such constraints arising from strong hydrogen-bond (H-bond) interactions between unimers that lead to the failure of living CDSA are effectively overcome via reduction of the H-bond strength. In particular, by adding a H-bond disruptor trifluoroethanol (TFE), decreasing the unimer concentration, and reducing the corona segment length, the H-bond strength between unimers could be efficiently alleviated, leading to the formation of uniform two-dimensional (2D) platelets with controlled size and block comicelles with spatially defined corona chemistries. Moreover, by selectively anchoring one-dimensional (1D) seeds on the surface of as-prepared 2D block comicelles through H-bond interaction, the epitaxial growth of a crystalline BCP from immobilized 1D seeds on 2D platelets illustrates competitive growth behavior in a spatially confined environment.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

Specifically, we investigate how and why consumers may transition toward adopting and using new pro-environmental technologies (PETs), namely electric vehicles, solar panels, and a green electricity program. We build a conceptual framework from lifestyle theory, where lifestyle is defined as a grouping of related practices that can reflect and inform the consumer's self-concept (or identity). We apply this framework using a novel quantitative survey method, implemented with a representative sample of 711 San Diego households. Through factor analysis, we identify engagement in pro-environmental practices as independent of engagement in other lifestyle types. We then group respondents into five clusters based on lifestyle engagement, attitudes and openness to lifestyle change (liminality). The three clusters with green attitudes (""greens"") vary substantially by interest in PETs. ""Engaged"" and ""aspiring"" greens are attracted to all three PETs, while ""low-tech"" greens report mild interest in green electricity only. Non-green ""techies"" only report interest in solar panels, while ""traditionalists"" report uniformly low PET interest. Results demonstrate the relevance of lifestyle theory, and provide a unique, empirical application that can improve understandings of opportunities and barriers to sustainable consumption.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

Findings reveal that airline pilots are quasi-professional experts who developed specialized skills based on talent and experience which allowed them to work autonomously and enjoy a correspondingly high sense of trust and prestige for which they were often well compensated. However, results of this study suggest high labour costs and weak professional communities leave quasi-professional experts vulnerable to managerial cost-cutting and work intensification agendas, particularly during periods of merger, downsizing and other forms of industry restructuring. Findings signal a deprofessionalization of some elite fields in which experts’ specialized skills become devalued and the industry-specific nature of their expertise reduces career options and job mobility.

"On-surface synthesis of thiophene-containing large-sized organometallic macrocycles on the Ag(111) surface","https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/publications/on-surface-synthesis-of-thiophene-containing-large-sized-organome","Zhang, X.; Shen, Q.; Ding, H.; Chen, X.; Yang, H.; Li, B.; Liu, X.; Lin, H.; Li, Q.; Gao, J.; Li, G.; Pan, M.; Guo, Q.","3 Jun 2021","On-surface synthesis is exhibited as a promising “bottom-up” approach for fabricating numerous macromolecular nanostructures. Compared to noncyclic architectures, macrocycles are of significant interest due to their specific “endless” cyclic topology and hence tunable topology-dependent properties. The synthesis of macrocycles with well-defined composition and geometry remains a great challenge, especially for large-sized cyclic rings. Here, we report a successful synthesis of large-sized organometallic macrocycles on the Ag(111) surface via utilizing thiophene-containing molecules, such as 1,3-dibromo-5-hexyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD), as a precursor. The structures of the macrocycles are investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations. The organometallic trans-configured chains and cis-configured (TPD-Ag)n (n = 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20) rings are the main products of an on-surface reaction. By controlling the on-surface reaction pathway, the 18-membered macrocycle can be made as the dominant product of all cyclic configurations. The (TPD-Ag)n macrocycles are realized by the cyclization of organometallic units and occurred on the stage of an intermediate phase. The effects of surface diffusion barriers are further demonstrated by our attempts on Ag(110) and Ag(100) surfaces. The feasibility of such a synthetic method for macrocycles is further proven by the on-surface reaction with Me-TPD precursors.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

An action language is used for the low-level (LL) and high-level (HL) system descriptions in the architecture, and the definition of recorded histories in the HL is expanded to allow prioritized defaults. For any given goal, tentative plans created in the HL using default knowledge and commonsense reasoning are implemented in the LL using probabilistic algorithms, with the corresponding observations used to update the HL history. Tight coupling between the two levels enables automatic selection of relevant variables and generation of suitable action policies in the LL for each HL action, and supports reasoning with violation of defaults, noisy observations and unreliable actions in large and complex domains. The architecture is evaluated in simulation and on physical robots transporting objects in indoor domains; the benefit on robots is a reduction in task execution time of 39% compared with a purely probabilistic, but still hierarchical, approach.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

A.; Nechayev, Y. I.; Hall, P. S.; Constantinou, C.","1 Jan 2011","Although the medical implant communication service (MICS) band is a good candidate for implant applications, there are no models for in-body to out-of-body channels in this frequency band. The real experiment with an implant antenna is difficult. So, an approximate test is done using an on-body antenna covered by a layer of fresh meat. Three scenarios of heart implant-walking, wrist implant-walking and heart implant-realistic are considered. Short-term and long-term fading were decoupled. Stationarity tests state that both of the walking scenarios are stationary where the realistic scenario that includes sitting down and standing up in random times and orientations is non-stationary. Several distribution functions were tested to fit with the short-term and long-term data. The results show that the short-term fadings of heart and wrist implant-walking scenarios are best described by normal and Weibull distributions respectively, where the log-logistic distribution describes the long-term fading of walking scenarios best.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

The bound on the vertex degree is asymptotically best possible. Our proof uses the hypergraph regularity method, and in particular a recent version of the hypergraph regularity lemma proved by Allen, B\""ottcher, Cooley and Mycroft.

"Hybrid projection methods for large-scale inverse problems with mixed Gaussian priors","https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/publications/hybrid-projection-methods-for-large-scale-inverse-problems-with-m","Cho, T.; Chung, J.; Jiang, J.","1 Apr 2021","When solving ill-posed inverse problems, a good choice of the prior is critical for the computation of a reasonable solution. A common approach is to include a Gaussian prior, which is defined by a mean vector and a symmetric and positive definite covariance matrix, and to use iterative projection methods to solve the corresponding regularized problem. However, a main challenge for many of these iterative methods is that the prior covariance matrix must be known and fixed (up to a constant) before starting the solution process. In this paper, we develop hybrid projection methods for inverse problems with mixed Gaussian priors where the prior covariance matrix is a convex combination of matrices and the mixing parameter and the regularization parameter do not need to be known in advance. Such scenarios may arise when data is used to generate a sample prior covariance matrix (e.g., in data assimilation) or when different priors are needed to capture different qualities of the solution. The proposed hybrid methods are based on a mixed Golub–Kahan process, which is an extension of the generalized Golub–Kahan bidiagonalization, and a distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that both the regularization parameter and the weighting parameter for the covariance matrix can be estimated automatically during the iterative process. Furthermore, for problems where training data are available, various data-driven covariance matrices (including those based on learned covariance kernels) can be easily incorporated. Numerical examples from tomographic reconstruction demonstrate the potential for these methods.","Tech","University of Birmingham"

The maximum magnitude of out-of-plane NPR is identified in the case of (20 F/20 C/-20 C/20 C) S laminate as well. Meanwhile, a method for the geometric non-linear analysis of hybrid laminated beam with NPR including the non-linear bending, free, and forced vibrations is proposed. The beam deformation is modeled by combining higher-order shear-deformation theory (HSDT) and large deflection theory. Based on a two-step perturbation approach, the asymptotic solutions of the governing equations are obtained to capture the linear and non-linear frequencies and load-deflection curves. Moreover, a two-step perturbation methodology in conjunction with fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is employed to solve the forced-vibration problem. Several key factors, such as CNT distribution, variations in the elastic foundation, and thermal stress, are considered in the exhaustive analysis. Theoretical results for some particular cases are given to examine the geometric non-linearity behavior of hybrid beam with NPR as well as positive Poisson's ratio (PPR).","Tech","University of Birmingham"

However, the full impact videos have on learning is under researched and not fully known. This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of quiz questions embedded throughout a video. Students from different modules (n1 = 102, n2 = 23) watched three different formats of videos and subsequent results of a multiple choice test were recorded and compared. In addition, viewing behaviour was recorded and explored to evaluate if this also impacted upon results. Results highlighted, that the performance on tests significantly improved after watching the video with embedded quiz questions throughout. Contrary to the test scores, students’ perceptions did not identify any differences, however students’ qualitative comments showed overwhelming support for quizzes embedded throughout a video. Implications on professional practice and further research to build upon this study are discussed.","Tech","University of Birmingham"
