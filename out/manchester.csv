Computations agree well with experimental data of the bare rotor but indicate that three-dimensional unsteadiness means that a strictly 2-dimensional idealization produces too high lift and too low drag. The addition of discs, while leading toapparently negative drag coefficients, does not produce the striking rise in lift coefficients that Thom’s experiments had shown. Moreover, the great increase in torque coefficients associated with adding discs seemsto exclude their use in sea-going propulsion applications.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

S.; Wang, J.; Ruxton, T.; Yang, J. B.; Liu, J.","2004","Safety assessment based on conventional methods such as probability risk assessment (PRA) may not be well suited for dealing with innovative systems having a high level of uncertainty, particularly in the feasibility and concept design stages of a maritime engineering system. By contrast, safety models using fuzzy logic approaches employing fuzzy IF-THEN rules can model the qualitative aspects of human knowledge and reasoning processes without employing precise quantitative analyses. Fuzzy-logic-based approaches may be more appropriately used to carry out risk analysis in the initial design stages of large maritime engineering systems. This provides a tool for working directly with the linguistic terms commonly used in carrying out safety assessment. This paper focuses on the development and representation of linguistic variables to model risk levels subjectively. These variables are then quantified using fuzzy set theory. In this paper, the development of two safety evaluation frameworks using fuzzy logic approaches for maritime engineering safety-based decision support in the concept design stage are presented. An example is used to illustrate and compare the proposed approaches. Future risk analysis in maritime engineering applications may take full advantages of fuzzy logic approaches to complement existing ones.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.; Gunasekaran, A.; Tiwari, M. K.","8 Mar 2017","Maritime inventory routing problem is addressed in this paper to satisfy the demand at different ports during the planning horizon. It explores the possibilities of integrating slow steaming policy as mentioned in Kontovas et al. (2011) and Norstad et al. (2011) within ship routing. A mixed integer non-linear programming model is presented considering various scheduling and routing constraints, loading/unloading constraints and vessel capacity constraints. Non-linear equation between fuel consumption and vessel speed has been incorporated to capture the sustainability aspects. Several time window constraints are inculcated in the mathematical model to enhance the service level at each port. Penalty costs are incurred if the ship arrives early before the starting of the time window or if it finishes its operation after the ending of the time window. Costs associated with the violation of time window helps in maintaining a proper port discipline. Now, owing to the inherent complexity of the aforementioned problem, an effective search heuristics named Particle Swarm Optimization for Composite Particle (PSO-CP) is employed. Particle Swarm Optimization – Differential Evolution (PSO-DE), Basic PSO and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are used to validate the result obtained from PSO-CP. Computational results provided for different problem instances shows the superiority of PSO-CP over the other algorithms in terms of the solution obtained.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

After providing an ethnographic account of the contemporary place of the sea in local discourses of Hunchun’s identity, I draw on archival material to analyze the politico-linguistic history of maritime affairs in this part of China and beyond. I examine how the notion yang (ocean/foreign) transformed from being a label of foreign interventions in China to serving as a metaphor for domestic economic progress. The sea is both a distant dream and a source of concrete developmental potential for Hunchun today. It is also an optic through which to observe the town’s future.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

H.","1 Oct 2022","With the rise of global trade, maritime transportation networks have become an indispensable element of logistics networks. Approximately 80% of the global trade volume is transported by sea with the maritime logistics network fueling global economic integration. Due to the uncertainty of the transportation process and the impact of accidents, the reliability analysis of the logistics network is a topic of immense interest. In this paper, we propose an original and novel model to quantitatively analyze the vulnerability of the maritime logistics network by considering the importance of each port in the network. Three centrality measures that consider different topology information of the network are used in this paper to identify the importance of ports. Different information about the network is considered through the joint entropy and the multiscale factor  to evaluate the vulnerability of the logistics network. The Asia–Europe maritime transportation network serves as a real-world example to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed model. The experimental results suggest that the performance of the maritime network is closely related to the heterogeneity of the connectivity pattern and the process of decentralization can reduce the vulnerability of the maritime network.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Predicting climate change impacts on maritime Antarctic soils: A space-for-time substitution study","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/predicting-climate-change-impacts-on-maritime-antarctic-soils-a-s","Horrocks, C. A.; Newsham, K. K.; Cox, F.; Garnett, M. H.; Robinson, C. H.; Dungait, J. A. J.","Feb 2020","We report a space-for-time substitution study predicting the impacts of climate change on vegetated maritime Antarctic soils. Analyses of soils from under Deschampsia antarctica sampled from three islands along a 2,200 km climatic gradient indicated that those from sub-Antarctica had higher moisture, organic matter and carbon (C) concentrations, more depleted δ13C values, lower concentrations of the fungal biomarker ergosterol and higher concentrations of bacterial PLFA biomarkers and plant wax n-alkane biomarkers than those from maritime Antarctica. Shallow soils (2 cm depth) were wetter, and had higher concentrations of organic matter, ergosterol and bacterial PLFAs, than deeper soils (4 cm and 8 cm depths). Correlative analyses indicated that factors associated with climate change (increased soil moisture, C and organic matter concentrations, and depleted δ13C contents) are likely to give rise to increases in Gram negative bacteria, and decreases in Gram positive bacteria and fungi, in maritime Antarctic soils. Bomb-14C analyses indicated that sub-Antarctic soils at all depths contained significant amounts of modern 14C (C fixed from the atmosphere post c. 1955), whereas modern 14C was restricted to depths of 2 cm and 4 cm in maritime Antarctica. The oldest C (c. 1,745 years BP) was present in the southernmost soil. The higher nitrogen (N) concentrations and δ15N values recorded in the southernmost soil were attributed to N inputs from bird guano. Based on these analyses, we conclude that 5–8 °C rises in air temperature, together with associated increases in precipitation, are likely to have substantial impacts on maritime Antarctic soils, but that, at the rates of climate warming predicted under moderate greenhouse gas emission scenarios, these impacts are likely to take at least a century to manifest themselves.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.; Cox, F.; Sands, C. J.; Garnett, M. H.; Magan, N.; Horrocks, C. A.; Dungait, J. A. J.; Robinson, C.","1 Dec 2020","We report a previously undescribed member of the Helotiales that is superabundant in soils at two maritime Antarctic islands under Antarctic Hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica Desv.). High throughput sequencing showed that up to 92% of DNA reads, and 68% of RNA reads, in soils from the islands were accounted for by the fungus. Sequencing of the large subunit region of ribosomal (r)DNA places the fungus close to the Pezizellaceae, Porodiplodiaceae, and Sclerotiniaceae, with analyses of internal transcribed spacer regions of rDNA indicating that it has affinities to previously unnamed soil and root fungi from alpine, cool temperate and Low Arctic regions. The fungus was found to be most frequent in soils containing C aged to 1,000–1,200 years before present. The relative abundances of its DNA and RNA reads were positively associated with soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations and δ13C values, with the relative abundance of its DNA being negatively associated with soil pH value. An isolate of the fungus produces flask-shaped phialides with a pronounced venter bearing masses of conidia measuring 4.5–6(7) × 1.8–2.5 μm, suggestive of anamorphic Chalara. Enzymatic studies indicate that the isolate strongly synthesizes the extracellular enzyme acid phosphatase, and also exhibits alkaline phosphatase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase activities. Ecophysiological measurements indicate optimal hyphal growth of the isolate at a pH of 4.2–4.5 and a water potential of −0.66 MPa. The isolate is a psychrotroph, exhibiting measureable hyphal growth at −2°C, optimal hyphal extension rate at 15°C and negligible growth at 25°C. It is proposed that the rising temperatures that are predicted to occur in maritime Antarctica later this century will increase the growth rate of the fungus, with the potential loss of ancient C from soils. Analyses using the GlobalFungi Database indicate that the fungus is present in cold, acidic soils on all continents. We advocate further studies to identify whether it is superabundant in soils under D. antarctica elsewhere in maritime Antarctica, and for further isolates to be obtained so that the species can be formally described.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

We find that negative money supply shocks caused Spanish real output to decline. A transmission channel analysis highlights slow price adjustments and credit frictions as channels through which money supply changes affected the real economy. Especially large output declines occurred in textile manufacturing against the backdrop of a credit crunch that impaired merchants’ ability to supply their manufacturers with inputs.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

In particular, historians have overlooked the division between the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. Yet portrayals of the two navies differed widely. Maritime films both during and after the war followed a well-established tradition of representing the navy as a force of disciplined and respectable men led by gentlemen heroes that reliably defended nation and empire. Such representations rarely acknowledged the existence of the Merchant Navy with its globally recruited and racially mixed workforce and its troubling associations with indiscipline. Yet naval operations largely concerned its protection, and the British war effort depended on the goods it transported. In the context of the leftward drift of wartime politics, the Merchant Navy received rare attention in a 1943 film that nevertheless avoided depicting non-white merchant seaman or disturbing the gender division. After the war the focus of maritime films returned to the Royal Navy. The liminal presence of the Merchant Navy in films of the 1950s was, however, significant. It was, variously, the vector for the expression of British insecurities about the wartime victory, the occasion for the portrayal of the enemy as an honourable foe, and a means to both romanticize, and hint at the fragility of, imperial masculinity. © The Author [2011].

Shifts in ownership from the state to private hands or pious foundations put further stress on the state’s traditional fiscal base. Christ argues that the sultans increased taxation and state intervention in response, and thus that control of the international transit trade turned out to be particularly profitable. In order to tap it more effectively, the Mamluk sultanate reinforced ties with the Venetians in the Mediterranean and the Rasulids in the Red Sea. Relations were grounded in an ambiguous language of gift exchange which allowed for the harmonization of nominal hierarchical difference and de facto bilateral, symbiotic exchange. On the basis of shared trade interests, the Mamluks delegated power over the ‘Two Seas’. This delegation was not perfect though; the Mamluks also sought to establish a direct if only seasonal fiscal presence in the Egyptian gateways of this trade in Alexandria, Upper Egypt and the Hijaz , thus combining delegation on the seas with tighter control in the ports in order to channel the lucrative transit trade through their Cairo power base.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The objective is to ensure continuity of operation at all sites by maintaining adequate inventory levels of all raw materials. We develop a novel multi-grid continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation based (Susarla, Li, & Karimi, 2010) for this chemical logistics problem. Our model allows limited jetties at each site, non-zero transfer times, variable load/unload quantities, transfer task sequencing, etc. In contrast to the literature, it needs no separate estimates for arrivals at each site. Several examples are solved to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed formulation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Instead, a range of ascomycete fungi, termed dark septate endophytes (DSEs), frequently colonise the roots of these plant species. We demonstrate that colonisation of Antarctic vascular plants by DSEs facilitates not only the acquisition of organic nitrogen as early protein breakdown products, but also as non-proteinaceous D-amino acids and their short peptides, accumulated in slowly-decomposing organic matter, such as moss peat. Our findings suggest that, in a warming maritime Antarctic, this symbiosis has a key role in accelerating the replacement of formerly dominant moss communities by vascular plants, and in increasing the rate at which ancient carbon stores laid down as moss peat over centuries or millennia are returned to the atmosphere as CO2.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Comparisons are made between the available experimental and LES data both for the bare cylinder, as employed in Flettner's notable Atlantic crossing, and the variant advocated by Thom in which close-packed discs are distributed along the cylinder. Our results display close agreement with available experimental and LES data other than the results of Thom (1934). We conclude that the addition of discs by the latter led, at the relatively low Reynolds numbers of his experiments, to the boundary layer on the cylinder being thinned to a point at which the boundary layers became laminar or transitional, thus leading to higher lift coefficients than pertain in turbulent flow. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This was made possible through use of a holographic instrument able to image cloud particles at very high resolution and small size (6 μm). The environment in which the observations were conducted was notable for the presence of desert dust advected over the ocean from the Sahara. However, there is no laboratory evidence to suggest that these dust particles can act as ice nuclei at temperatures warmer than about −10 ◦ C, the zone in which the first ice was observed in these clouds. The small ice particles were observed to grow rapidly by vapour diffusion, riming, and possibly through collisions with supercooled raindrops, causing these to freeze and potentially shatter. This in turn leads to the further production of secondary ice in these clouds. Hence, although the numbers of primary ice particles are small, they are very effective in initiating the rapid glaciation of the cloud, altering the dynamics and precipitation produc- tion processes.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Organic aerosol above a tropical rainforest located in Danum Valley, Borneo, Malaysia, a high isoprene emission region, was studied during Summer 2008 using Aerosol Mass Spectrometry and offline detailed characterisation using comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography. Observations indicate that a substantial fraction (up to 15% by mass) of atmospheric sub-micron organic aerosol was observed as methylfuran (MF) after thermal desorption. This observation was associated with the simultaneous measurements of established gas-phase isoprene oxidation products methylvinylketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR). Observations of MF were also made during experimental chamber oxidation of isoprene. Positive matrix factorisation of the AMS organic mass spectral time series produced a robust factor which accounts for an average of 23% (0.18μgm-3), reaching as much as 53% (0.50 μgm-3) of the total oraganic loading, identified by (and highly correlated with) a strong MF signal. Assuming that this factor is generally representative of isoprene SOA, isoprene derived aerosol plays a significant role in the region. Comparisons with measurements from other studies suggest this type of isoprene SOA plays a role in other isoprene dominated environments, albeit with varying significance. © 2011 Author(s).","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Therefore, transportation ferries must be watched closely by local maritime administrators, which involves much manpower. With the use of historical data, this article proposes an intelligent method of integrating artificial potential field with Bayesian Network to trigger deviation warnings for a ferry based on its trajectory, speed and course. More specifically, a repulsive potential field-based model is first established to capture a customary waterway of ferries. Subsequently, a method based on non-linear optimisation is introduced to train the coefficients of the proposed repulsive potential field. The deviation of a ferry from the customary route can then be quantified by the potential field. Bayesian Network is further introduced to trigger deviation warnings in accordance with the distribution of deviation values, speeds and courses. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by the historical data of a chosen ferry on a specific route. The testing results show that the approach is capable of providing deviation warnings for ferries accurately and can offer a practical solution for maritime supervision.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

M.; Mingham, C. G.; McLean, D. A.; Bandar, Z.

The methods most commonly used for the prediction of time-averaged overtopping volumes are parametric regression and numerical modelling. In this paper overtopping volumes are predicted using artificial neural networks. This approach is inherently non-parametric and accepts data from a variety of structural configurations and sea-states. Two different types of neural network are considered: multi-layer perceptron networks and radial basis function networks. It was found that the radial basis function networks considerably outperform both the multi-layer perceptron networks and the curve-fitting (parametric regression) regime, and approach bespoke numerical simulations in accuracy. Unlike numerical simulation, the neural network approach gives generic prediction across a range of structures and sea-states and therefore incurs considerably less computational cost.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Whether trading wool across the Channel to Europe, seeking spices in South Asia or importing sugar from the Caribbean, shipping was an essential resource. Yet, to undertake these trades, merchants required naval supplies – finished ships, timber to build them and stores to fill them – that were not always easily accessible. This challenge was particularly apparent in the early seventeenth century for trading corporations whose specific needs demanded innovative approaches to the naval supply problem. This article examines the responses of English corporations to the challenge of supplying its international shipping by focusing on activities on each side of the Atlantic. First, it assesses the development of the East India Company’s docks at Blackwall and Dundaniel, before turning to a detailed study of ship-building and supply in Virginia and New England. In doing so, this article highlights the importance of naval supply to Britain’s north Atlantic empire, both in terms of the rhetorical support for empire and the economic incentives of participants. This reveals how traditional interpretations of Britain’s naval development have too often focused on state-driven activities (particularly from the very end of the seventeenth century) and failed to examine the complex, sometimes chaotic attempts by private individuals and corporations to overcome the naval supply challenges common to this early period of globalisation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The numerical model requires two adjustable parameters: the bed friction coefficient and a wave breaking parameter. Excellent agreement was achieved between the numerical predictions of solitary wave transformation and run-up at a plane beach with two sets of high-quality laboratory measurements: one a large number of experiments in a wave flume by Synolakis, the other in the UK Coastal Research Facility. A parameter study investigated the effect of uniform offshore water depth, bed friction and bed slope on solitary wave run-up. A uniform water depth may be associated with a continental shelf region. The non-dimensional run-up was found to be an asymptotic function of non-dimensional wave amplitude at high and low values of initial wave steepness. Both asymptotes scale as (R/ho) ∼ α(Ao/h o)β where R is run-up (defined as the vertical elevation reached by the wave uprush above still water level), Ao is the offshore wave amplitude and ho is the uniform depth offshore of the beach. The empirical coefficients α and β depend on the beach characteristics. The model is then used to simulate the interaction of a full-scale tsunami event with an idealised beach profile representative of a beach in Eastern Kamchatka.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Furthermore, evidence collected through a survey instrument addressed to shipping companies located in Greece suggests that the choice of MCS is contingent upon the strategy pursued by the shipping companies. Moreover, this paper tests whether shipping companies with an optimal fit between their strategies and their MCS experience superior business performance and a higher perceived usefulness of MCS.

This article argues that it is therefore unsurprising that the sea also impacted on copper workers in the southern Aegean during the Early Bronze Age. Here, the sea was an integral element of the copper production, which is characterized by movement of metal across the sea from one manufacturing stage to the next—often over considerable distances requiring lengthy absences of the workers from their home communities, making metalworkers true maritime specialists alongside the more “typical” traders, fishermen, and seafarers. The distances traveled magnified the symbolic value of the raw materials as the object’s geographic distance became converted into a symbolic value-added “exotic” distance. This value was further enhanced thanks to the mastery of skills required to traverse the sea, an element very different from land and intimately associated with forgetting, disposal, and death.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Based on the marked reduction in seafood consumption after the Mesolithic and the use of marine creatures in funerary iconography in the post-palatial period, it becomes apparent that the sea-then as now-is an inherently ambiguous medium that captures both positive and negative emotions.

K.","4 Dec 2017","This research addresses the sustainability and safety related challenges associated with the complex, practical, and real-time maritime transportation problem, and proposes a multiobjective mathematical model integrating different shipping operations. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is formulated considering different maritime operations, such as routing and scheduling of ships, time window concept considering port's high tidal scenario, discrete planning horizon, loading/unloading operation, carbon emission from the vessel, and ship's draft restriction for maintaining the vessel's safety at the port. The relationship between fuel consumption and vessel speed optimization is included in the model for the estimation of the total fuel consumed and carbon emission from each vessel. Time window concept considered in the problem aims to improve the service level of the port by imposing different penalty charges associated with the early arrival of the vessel before the starting of the time window and vessel failing to finish its operation within the allotted time window. Another practical aspect of the maritime transportation such as high tide scenario is included in the model to depict the vessel arrival and departure time at a port. Two novel algorithms-Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Multiobjective particle swarm optimization have been applied to solve the multiobjective mathematical model. The illustrative examples inspired from the real-life problems of an international shipping company are considered for application. The experimental results, comparative, and sensitivity analysis demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Mixed radiation fields of this type can arise in the context of reactor accidents via, for example, 137Cs (gamma) and 244Cm (neutrons). However, performance degradation of such scintillators, such as EJ-301, is a significant possibility that might limit the use of this technology in accident response applications. The premise behind the high dose rate testing of such a liquid scintillator described in this paper is for fuel debris characterisation at Fukushima Daiichi, which has expected dose rates of up to 1000 Gy/hr in close proximity to fuel debris. The tests carried out for this investigation involved using the 60Co gamma irradiation facility at the Dalton Cumbria Facility, Cumbria, United Kingdom to expose the detector to a similar dose rate to that which is estimated within the primary containment vessel for survivability tests. Radiation hardness tests have rarely been reported for such devices and it is expected that the performance will be dependent on the survival of the window of the photomultiplier tube rather than the liquid scintillant itself. A major advantage of the use of this detector is its physical size, due to the limitations on access into Fukushima reactors physical space is a premium. The research described in this paper presents the results of the dose rate exposure of the detector before signal was lost with the total dose observed providing information on any degradation affecting the performance of the device post-irradiation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

To map the gamma-ray environment, a cerium bromide scintillator detector with a small form factor has been incorporated into the AVEXIS to identify radioactive isotopes via gamma-ray spectroscopy. This provides the combined system with the potential to map gamma-ray spectra and particle locations throughout submerged, contaminated facilities, such as Units 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

The complexity of the global shipping system makes predicting volumes and patterns of long-term future international maritime trade a challenging task which is best explored by building scenarios rather than ‘precise’ forecasts. We present four contrasting scenarios of international maritime trade out to 2050, available in high resolution in terms of the dimensions studied (regions, countries, commodities, decades), which are consistent with high and low levels of global CO2 mitigation and associated climate impacts. The scenarios project trade increasing to between two and four times the 2010 value by 2050. Scenarios characterised by low temperature increases and material intensity lead to the lower bound trade increase with high trade growth in bioenergy commodities. Unfettered production growth across countries, high temperature increases and material intensity lead to a quadrupling of trade across energy, containerised, dry and wet commodities. The estimated range is lower than those in existing scenarios and forecasts in which globalisation is assumed to continue apace. The scenarios which project the highest growth presupposes both limited decarbonisation (in contrast to the Paris Agreement) and continued growth in expanding markets. The scenarios therefore become a valuable policy and decision-making tool to address technological and operational change required of the shipping sector, if it is to deliver mitigation in line with the Paris Agreement.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The precise location of the debris is not known, for example as to whether it remains within the reactor pressure vessel or it has leaked through into the base of the pedestal below. Additionally, the state of the fuel is also in question as to whether this has evolved from within its cladding or if it is intact. The most likely scenario is a combination of all four of these situations. The flooding of the reactor floors immediately following the Fukushima accident adds an extra element of complexity for the detection system, for example requiring it to be submersible and to hold any detector system in water-tight confinement. The research carried out has involved extensive modifications to a previously-designed, low-cost, small-scale AVEXIS submersible inspection vehicle and the incorporation of a variety of radiation detectors. The latter has been designed to allow for mapping and determination of the situation that is present within the primary containment vessels. The challenges addressed with the detection system arise from the high dose rates that have been recorded around the reactor pressure vessels which can be as high as 1000 Gy/hr. In such a harsh environment not only will the radiation detectors struggle to operate but the components that make up the remote-operated vehicle are also likely to suffer radiation damage after only a relatively short period of time. The research presented here evaluates the components comprising the AVEXIS system in terms of their radiation tolerability as well as presenting the combination of detectors to be used in the remote probe for the investigation of the fuel debris.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

As such, refugees are now crossing waters that have become extended sovereign borders. This is manifest in increased maritime surveillance to prevent refugees arriving by boat and landing on Europe’s and Australia’s shores. In this context, materially and symbolically, lighthouses mark out the space between the sea and land and in so doing, delimit these territorial and maritime borders. Although the function of the lighthouse is to warn those at sea of the dangers on the coastline, steering them away from coastal hazards and guiding them through a safe passage, for many sea travellers it can also represent the safety of the land, of arrival. This paper explores the ambiguous roles and effects of lighthouses; uniquely placed as sentinel posts along the coast they can aid military surveillance and control while at the same time enabling humanitarian assistance. It explores these conflicting functions focusing on how the lighthouse, as a border between land and sea, simultaneously protects and excludes offering beacons of hope as well as signalling danger.

This article assesses the risk levels of bearing and gearbox, which are the most sensitive components of the ship crane using fuzzy rule–based judgement for common elements and their sources. This will provide the ship crane operators with a means to predict possible impending failure without having to dismantle the crane. Furthermore, to monitor the rate of wear in gearbox and bearing of a ship crane, the ship crane reliability, and a trend to provide an operational baseline of data that will help the engineers to detect abnormal wear rates as they develop, is established. Within the scope of this research, a risk assessment model is developed for determining the risk levels of a crane’s components and recommending solutions using all the diagnostic capability obtainable for effective condition monitoring of the gearbox and bearing in ship cranes.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

In doing so, we scrutinize how notions of urban resilience, climate adaptation, and ecosystem-based infrastructure are influencing contemporary planning practice. Our account from New Orleans and the Mississippi River Delta traces several large-scale hydrological engineering projects with origins in the early 20th century, which aimed to restructure the landscape for more effective maritime transportation, flood protection, and urban drainage. The account then turns to a discussion of a massive and ongoing planning project, which aims to restore the historical dynamics of the Mississippi River Delta, diverting the river into nearby coastal wetlands to provide storm protection for vulnerable communities, most especially New Orleans. Our analysis shows how the development of water infrastructure systems in the region produced cleavages in the region's body politic and eco-hydrology, generating disputes that threaten to slow or obstruct the plan's implementation. The study shows how the forms and discourses of political contention in the present are deeply informed by past decisions regarding the placement, operation, and maintenance of water infrastructures in the region. The conflicts that emerge from these cleavages comprise the primary obstacle facing ecosystem-based strategies aimed at securing New Orleans and other major settlements in the region from storm surges. This raises fundamental challenges for planning practice, which are explored here through a discussion of situational dissensus, conflicting rationalities, and pathways for democratic institutional innovation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Emphasis is placed on characterizing ice particle shapes in Tropical Maritime and Mid‐Latitude Continental anvil cirrus, as well as in cirrus formed in situ in the upper troposphere, and subvisible cirrus in the upper tropical troposphere layer. There is a distinctive difference in cirrus ice particle shapes formed in situ compared to those in anvils that are generated in close proximity to convection. More than half the mass in cirrus formed in situ are rosette‐shapes (polycrystals and bullet rosettes). Cirrus formed from fresh convective anvils is mostly devoid of rosette‐shaped particles. However, small frozen drops may experience regrowth downwind of an aged anvil in a regime with RHice > ~ 120%, and then grow into rosette shapes. Identifiable particle shapes in Tropical Maritime anvils that have not been impacted by continental influences typically contain mostly single plate‐like and columnar crystals and aggregates. Mid‐Latitude Continental anvils contain single rimed particles, more and larger aggregates with riming, and chains of small ice particles when in a highly electrified environment. The particles in subvisible cirrus are < ~ 100 μm and quasi‐spherical with some plates and rare trigonal shapes.

Notable examples are found in the Pyrenees, Maritime Alps, Italian Apennines, the Dinaric and Albanian Alps and the mountains of Turkey. Many glaciers disappeared during the 20th Century. Glaciers were much larger and more numerous during the Little Ice Age. Small glaciers even existed as far south as the High Atlas of Morocco and the Sierra Nevada of southern Spain. In more northerly areas, such as the western Balkans, glaciers and permanent snow fields occupied hundreds of cirques on relatively low-lying mountains. In the High Atlas and the Sierra Nevada no glaciers exist today, whilst in the Balkans only a few modern glaciers have been reported (","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Composite particle algorithm for sustainable integrated dynamic ship routing and scheduling optimization","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/composite-particle-algorithm-for-sustainable-integrated-dynamic-s","De, A.; Mamanduru, V. K. R.; Gunasekaran, A.; Subramanian, N.; Tiwari, M. K.","8 Apr 2016","Ship routing and scheduling problem is considered to meet the demand for various products in multiple ports within the planning horizon. The ports have restricted operating time, so multiple time windows are taken into account. The problem addresses the operational measures such as speed optimisation and slow steaming for reducing carbon emission. A Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model is presented and it includes the issues pertaining to multiple time horizons, sustainability aspects and varying demand and supply at various ports. The formulation incorporates several real time constraints addressing the multiple time window, varying supply and demand, carbon emission, etc. that conceive a way to represent several complicating scenarios experienced in maritime transportation. Owing to the inherent complexity, such a problem is considered to be NP-Hard in nature and for solutions an effective meta-heuristics named Particle Swarm Optimization-Composite Particle (PSO-CP) is employed. Results obtained from PSO-CP are compared using PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and GA (Genetic Algorithm) to prove its superiority. Addition of sustainability constraints leads to a 4-10% variation in the total cost. Results suggest that the carbon emission, fuel cost and fuel consumption constraints can be comfortably added to the mathematical model for encapsulating the sustainability dimensions.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

"Vascular plant success in a warming Antarctic may be due to efficient nitrogen acquisition","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/vascular-plant-success-in-a-warming-antarctic-may-be-due-to-effic","Hill, P. W.; Farrar, J.; Roberts, P.; Farrell, M.; Grant, H.; Newsham, K. K.; Hopkins, D. W.; Bardgett, R. D.; Jones, D. L.","Apr 2011","For the past 50 years there has been rapid warming in the maritime Antarctic, with concurrent, and probably temperature-mediated, proliferation of the two native plants, Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) and especially Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica). In many terrestrial ecosystems at high latitudes, nitrogen (N) supply regulates primary productivity. Although the predominant view is that only inorganic and amino acid N are important sources of N for angiosperms, most N enters soil as protein. Maritime Antarctic soils have large stocks of proteinaceous N, which is released slowly as decomposition is limited by low temperatures. Consequently, an ability to acquire N at an early stage of availability is key to the success of photosynthetic organisms. Here we show that D. antarctica can acquire N through its roots as short peptides, produced at an early stage of protein decomposition, acquiring N over three times faster than as amino acid, nitrate or ammonium, and more than 160 times faster than the mosses with which it competes. Efficient acquisition of the N released in faster decomposition of soil organic matter as temperatures rise may give D. antarctica an advantage over competing mosses that has facilitated its recent proliferation in the maritime Antarctic. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Mass-balance characteristics of arctic glaciers","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/mass-balance-characteristics-of-arctic-glaciers","Braithwaite, R. J.","2005","A survey of available mass-balance data shows that glaciers on arctic islands, i.e. mountain glaciers and ice caps in northern Canada, Greenland, Svalbard and the Eurasian islands, share mass-balance characteristics of low annual amplitude and small interannual variability. By contrast, glaciers around the Arctic (e.g. in Alaska, Iceland, mainland Scandinavia and northern Eurasia) can have exceptionally large annual amplitude and interannual variability but otherwise share characteristics with glaciers in lower latitudes. The arctic island glaciers occur in areas with low annual precipitation and high annual temperature variability, i.e. in dry-cold or continental regions. Most glaciers surrounding the Arctic (Alaska, Iceland and Scandinavia) occur in areas with high annual precipitation and low annual temperature variability, i.e. in wet-warm or maritime regions. Earlier mass-balance modelling showed that arctic island glaciers have low sensitivity to temperature changes consistent with their low mass-balance amplitude. However, very large changes in mass balance could occur on arctic island glaciers if the sea ice surrounding the arctic islands were reduced so that the climate of the arctic islands becomes more maritime.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

"Blue diakonia: the mission of Indonesian churches for and with the sea","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/blue-diakonia-the-mission-of-indonesian-churches-for-and-with-the","Maggang, E.","18 Nov 2022","How could the Indonesian churches’ ministry of diakonia contribute to overcoming the marine ecological crisis? Because the poor suffer the most from that crisis, diakonia, which considers looking after the poor as one of its concerns, can play a critical role. However, instead of focusing exclusively on human interest, this article seeks to conceptualise diakonia as a ministry that has concerns for all creatures whose lives rely on the sea, and the sea itself. I begin with integrating the marine ecological crisis into diakonia by engaging with theological discourses on diakonia to suggest that such an integration is plausible and necessary. This integration leads to a discussion on the emerging discourse of eco-diakonia to argue that the sea should be a recipient of diakonia. Then, based on the encounter between a Christian theology of diakonia and traditional maritime cultures of Indonesia navigated by a Trinitarian pneumatology of creation, I proceed further to argue that the sea should also be perceived as diakonos. These arguments constitute the concept of ‘blue diakonia’: a ministry that acknowledges and supports the sea as an active participant in the Trinitarian Spirit’s work by feeding the poor and giving life to all creatures.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
