Computations agree well with experimental data of the bare rotor but indicate that three-dimensional unsteadiness means that a strictly 2-dimensional idealization produces too high lift and too low drag. The addition of discs, while leading toapparently negative drag coefficients, does not produce the striking rise in lift coefficients that Thom’s experiments had shown. Moreover, the great increase in torque coefficients associated with adding discs seemsto exclude their use in sea-going propulsion applications.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

S.; Wang, J.; Ruxton, T.; Yang, J. B.; Liu, J.","2004","Safety assessment based on conventional methods such as probability risk assessment (PRA) may not be well suited for dealing with innovative systems having a high level of uncertainty, particularly in the feasibility and concept design stages of a maritime engineering system. By contrast, safety models using fuzzy logic approaches employing fuzzy IF-THEN rules can model the qualitative aspects of human knowledge and reasoning processes without employing precise quantitative analyses. Fuzzy-logic-based approaches may be more appropriately used to carry out risk analysis in the initial design stages of large maritime engineering systems. This provides a tool for working directly with the linguistic terms commonly used in carrying out safety assessment. This paper focuses on the development and representation of linguistic variables to model risk levels subjectively. These variables are then quantified using fuzzy set theory. In this paper, the development of two safety evaluation frameworks using fuzzy logic approaches for maritime engineering safety-based decision support in the concept design stage are presented. An example is used to illustrate and compare the proposed approaches. Future risk analysis in maritime engineering applications may take full advantages of fuzzy logic approaches to complement existing ones.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.; Gunasekaran, A.; Tiwari, M. K.","8 Mar 2017","Maritime inventory routing problem is addressed in this paper to satisfy the demand at different ports during the planning horizon. It explores the possibilities of integrating slow steaming policy as mentioned in Kontovas et al. (2011) and Norstad et al. (2011) within ship routing. A mixed integer non-linear programming model is presented considering various scheduling and routing constraints, loading/unloading constraints and vessel capacity constraints. Non-linear equation between fuel consumption and vessel speed has been incorporated to capture the sustainability aspects. Several time window constraints are inculcated in the mathematical model to enhance the service level at each port. Penalty costs are incurred if the ship arrives early before the starting of the time window or if it finishes its operation after the ending of the time window. Costs associated with the violation of time window helps in maintaining a proper port discipline. Now, owing to the inherent complexity of the aforementioned problem, an effective search heuristics named Particle Swarm Optimization for Composite Particle (PSO-CP) is employed. Particle Swarm Optimization – Differential Evolution (PSO-DE), Basic PSO and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are used to validate the result obtained from PSO-CP. Computational results provided for different problem instances shows the superiority of PSO-CP over the other algorithms in terms of the solution obtained.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

After providing an ethnographic account of the contemporary place of the sea in local discourses of Hunchun’s identity, I draw on archival material to analyze the politico-linguistic history of maritime affairs in this part of China and beyond. I examine how the notion yang (ocean/foreign) transformed from being a label of foreign interventions in China to serving as a metaphor for domestic economic progress. The sea is both a distant dream and a source of concrete developmental potential for Hunchun today. It is also an optic through which to observe the town’s future.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

A.; Newsham, K. K.; Cox, F.; Garnett, M. H.; Robinson, C. H.; Dungait, J. A. J.","Feb 2020","We report a space-for-time substitution study predicting the impacts of climate change on vegetated maritime Antarctic soils. Analyses of soils from under Deschampsia antarctica sampled from three islands along a 2,200 km climatic gradient indicated that those from sub-Antarctica had higher moisture, organic matter and carbon (C) concentrations, more depleted δ13C values, lower concentrations of the fungal biomarker ergosterol and higher concentrations of bacterial PLFA biomarkers and plant wax n-alkane biomarkers than those from maritime Antarctica. Shallow soils (2 cm depth) were wetter, and had higher concentrations of organic matter, ergosterol and bacterial PLFAs, than deeper soils (4 cm and 8 cm depths). Correlative analyses indicated that factors associated with climate change (increased soil moisture, C and organic matter concentrations, and depleted δ13C contents) are likely to give rise to increases in Gram negative bacteria, and decreases in Gram positive bacteria and fungi, in maritime Antarctic soils. Bomb-14C analyses indicated that sub-Antarctic soils at all depths contained significant amounts of modern 14C (C fixed from the atmosphere post c. 1955), whereas modern 14C was restricted to depths of 2 cm and 4 cm in maritime Antarctica. The oldest C (c. 1,745 years BP) was present in the southernmost soil. The higher nitrogen (N) concentrations and δ15N values recorded in the southernmost soil were attributed to N inputs from bird guano. Based on these analyses, we conclude that 5–8 °C rises in air temperature, together with associated increases in precipitation, are likely to have substantial impacts on maritime Antarctic soils, but that, at the rates of climate warming predicted under moderate greenhouse gas emission scenarios, these impacts are likely to take at least a century to manifest themselves.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Exploring the vulnerability of transportation networks by entropy: A case study of Asia–Europe maritime transportation network","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/exploring-the-vulnerability-of-transportation-networks-by-entropy","Wen, T.; Gao, Q.; Chen, Y-W.; Cheong, K. H.","1 Oct 2022","With the rise of global trade, maritime transportation networks have become an indispensable element of logistics networks. Approximately 80% of the global trade volume is transported by sea with the maritime logistics network fueling global economic integration. Due to the uncertainty of the transportation process and the impact of accidents, the reliability analysis of the logistics network is a topic of immense interest. In this paper, we propose an original and novel model to quantitatively analyze the vulnerability of the maritime logistics network by considering the importance of each port in the network. Three centrality measures that consider different topology information of the network are used in this paper to identify the importance of ports. Different information about the network is considered through the joint entropy and the multiscale factor  to evaluate the vulnerability of the logistics network. The Asia–Europe maritime transportation network serves as a real-world example to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed model. The experimental results suggest that the performance of the maritime network is closely related to the heterogeneity of the connectivity pattern and the process of decentralization can reduce the vulnerability of the maritime network.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.; Cox, F.; Sands, C. J.; Garnett, M. H.; Magan, N.; Horrocks, C. A.; Dungait, J. A. J.; Robinson, C.","1 Dec 2020","We report a previously undescribed member of the Helotiales that is superabundant in soils at two maritime Antarctic islands under Antarctic Hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica Desv.). High throughput sequencing showed that up to 92% of DNA reads, and 68% of RNA reads, in soils from the islands were accounted for by the fungus. Sequencing of the large subunit region of ribosomal (r)DNA places the fungus close to the Pezizellaceae, Porodiplodiaceae, and Sclerotiniaceae, with analyses of internal transcribed spacer regions of rDNA indicating that it has affinities to previously unnamed soil and root fungi from alpine, cool temperate and Low Arctic regions. The fungus was found to be most frequent in soils containing C aged to 1,000–1,200 years before present. The relative abundances of its DNA and RNA reads were positively associated with soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations and δ13C values, with the relative abundance of its DNA being negatively associated with soil pH value. An isolate of the fungus produces flask-shaped phialides with a pronounced venter bearing masses of conidia measuring 4.5–6(7) × 1.8–2.5 μm, suggestive of anamorphic Chalara. Enzymatic studies indicate that the isolate strongly synthesizes the extracellular enzyme acid phosphatase, and also exhibits alkaline phosphatase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase activities. Ecophysiological measurements indicate optimal hyphal growth of the isolate at a pH of 4.2–4.5 and a water potential of −0.66 MPa. The isolate is a psychrotroph, exhibiting measureable hyphal growth at −2°C, optimal hyphal extension rate at 15°C and negligible growth at 25°C. It is proposed that the rising temperatures that are predicted to occur in maritime Antarctica later this century will increase the growth rate of the fungus, with the potential loss of ancient C from soils. Analyses using the GlobalFungi Database indicate that the fungus is present in cold, acidic soils on all continents. We advocate further studies to identify whether it is superabundant in soils under D. antarctica elsewhere in maritime Antarctica, and for further isolates to be obtained so that the species can be formally described.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

We find that negative money supply shocks caused Spanish real output to decline. A transmission channel analysis highlights slow price adjustments and credit frictions as channels through which money supply changes affected the real economy. Especially large output declines occurred in textile manufacturing against the backdrop of a credit crunch that impaired merchants’ ability to supply their manufacturers with inputs.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Divisions at sea: Class, gender, race, and nation in maritime films of the Second World War, 1939-60","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/divisions-at-sea-class-gender-race-and-nation-in-maritime-films-o","Summerfield, P.","Sep 2011","The configuration of the war at sea in the popular memory of the Second World War has been relatively neglected. In particular, historians have overlooked the division between the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. Yet portrayals of the two navies differed widely. Maritime films both during and after the war followed a well-established tradition of representing the navy as a force of disciplined and respectable men led by gentlemen heroes that reliably defended nation and empire. Such representations rarely acknowledged the existence of the Merchant Navy with its globally recruited and racially mixed workforce and its troubling associations with indiscipline. Yet naval operations largely concerned its protection, and the British war effort depended on the goods it transported. In the context of the leftward drift of wartime politics, the Merchant Navy received rare attention in a 1943 film that nevertheless avoided depicting non-white merchant seaman or disturbing the gender division. After the war the focus of maritime films returned to the Royal Navy. The liminal presence of the Merchant Navy in films of the 1950s was, however, significant. It was, variously, the vector for the expression of British insecurities about the wartime victory, the occasion for the portrayal of the enemy as an honourable foe, and a means to both romanticize, and hint at the fragility of, imperial masculinity. © The Author [2011].

Shifts in ownership from the state to private hands or pious foundations put further stress on the state’s traditional fiscal base. Christ argues that the sultans increased taxation and state intervention in response, and thus that control of the international transit trade turned out to be particularly profitable. In order to tap it more effectively, the Mamluk sultanate reinforced ties with the Venetians in the Mediterranean and the Rasulids in the Red Sea. Relations were grounded in an ambiguous language of gift exchange which allowed for the harmonization of nominal hierarchical difference and de facto bilateral, symbiotic exchange. On the basis of shared trade interests, the Mamluks delegated power over the ‘Two Seas’. This delegation was not perfect though; the Mamluks also sought to establish a direct if only seasonal fiscal presence in the Egyptian gateways of this trade in Alexandria, Upper Egypt and the Hijaz , thus combining delegation on the seas with tighter control in the ports in order to channel the lucrative transit trade through their Cairo power base.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The objective is to ensure continuity of operation at all sites by maintaining adequate inventory levels of all raw materials. We develop a novel multi-grid continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation based (Susarla, Li, & Karimi, 2010) for this chemical logistics problem. Our model allows limited jetties at each site, non-zero transfer times, variable load/unload quantities, transfer task sequencing, etc. In contrast to the literature, it needs no separate estimates for arrivals at each site. Several examples are solved to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed formulation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Instead, a range of ascomycete fungi, termed dark septate endophytes (DSEs), frequently colonise the roots of these plant species. We demonstrate that colonisation of Antarctic vascular plants by DSEs facilitates not only the acquisition of organic nitrogen as early protein breakdown products, but also as non-proteinaceous D-amino acids and their short peptides, accumulated in slowly-decomposing organic matter, such as moss peat. Our findings suggest that, in a warming maritime Antarctic, this symbiosis has a key role in accelerating the replacement of formerly dominant moss communities by vascular plants, and in increasing the rate at which ancient carbon stores laid down as moss peat over centuries or millennia are returned to the atmosphere as CO2.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Comparisons are made between the available experimental and LES data both for the bare cylinder, as employed in Flettner's notable Atlantic crossing, and the variant advocated by Thom in which close-packed discs are distributed along the cylinder. Our results display close agreement with available experimental and LES data other than the results of Thom (1934). We conclude that the addition of discs by the latter led, at the relatively low Reynolds numbers of his experiments, to the boundary layer on the cylinder being thinned to a point at which the boundary layers became laminar or transitional, thus leading to higher lift coefficients than pertain in turbulent flow. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This was made possible through use of a holographic instrument able to image cloud particles at very high resolution and small size (6 μm). The environment in which the observations were conducted was notable for the presence of desert dust advected over the ocean from the Sahara. However, there is no laboratory evidence to suggest that these dust particles can act as ice nuclei at temperatures warmer than about −10 ◦ C, the zone in which the first ice was observed in these clouds. The small ice particles were observed to grow rapidly by vapour diffusion, riming, and possibly through collisions with supercooled raindrops, causing these to freeze and potentially shatter. This in turn leads to the further production of secondary ice in these clouds. Hence, although the numbers of primary ice particles are small, they are very effective in initiating the rapid glaciation of the cloud, altering the dynamics and precipitation produc- tion processes.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Organic aerosol above a tropical rainforest located in Danum Valley, Borneo, Malaysia, a high isoprene emission region, was studied during Summer 2008 using Aerosol Mass Spectrometry and offline detailed characterisation using comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography. Observations indicate that a substantial fraction (up to 15% by mass) of atmospheric sub-micron organic aerosol was observed as methylfuran (MF) after thermal desorption. This observation was associated with the simultaneous measurements of established gas-phase isoprene oxidation products methylvinylketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR). Observations of MF were also made during experimental chamber oxidation of isoprene. Positive matrix factorisation of the AMS organic mass spectral time series produced a robust factor which accounts for an average of 23% (0.18μgm-3), reaching as much as 53% (0.50 μgm-3) of the total oraganic loading, identified by (and highly correlated with) a strong MF signal. Assuming that this factor is generally representative of isoprene SOA, isoprene derived aerosol plays a significant role in the region. Comparisons with measurements from other studies suggest this type of isoprene SOA plays a role in other isoprene dominated environments, albeit with varying significance. © 2011 Author(s).","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Q.; Ma, F.; Chen, Y. W.; Wang, J.","24 Dec 2019","Ferries are usually used for transporting passengers and vehicles among docks, and any deviation of the course can lead to serious consequences. Therefore, transportation ferries must be watched closely by local maritime administrators, which involves much manpower. With the use of historical data, this article proposes an intelligent method of integrating artificial potential field with Bayesian Network to trigger deviation warnings for a ferry based on its trajectory, speed and course. More specifically, a repulsive potential field-based model is first established to capture a customary waterway of ferries. Subsequently, a method based on non-linear optimisation is introduced to train the coefficients of the proposed repulsive potential field. The deviation of a ferry from the customary route can then be quantified by the potential field. Bayesian Network is further introduced to trigger deviation warnings in accordance with the distribution of deviation values, speeds and courses. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by the historical data of a chosen ferry on a specific route. The testing results show that the approach is capable of providing deviation warnings for ferries accurately and can offer a practical solution for maritime supervision.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

M.; Mingham, C. G.; McLean, D. A.; Bandar, Z.

The methods most commonly used for the prediction of time-averaged overtopping volumes are parametric regression and numerical modelling. In this paper overtopping volumes are predicted using artificial neural networks. This approach is inherently non-parametric and accepts data from a variety of structural configurations and sea-states. Two different types of neural network are considered: multi-layer perceptron networks and radial basis function networks. It was found that the radial basis function networks considerably outperform both the multi-layer perceptron networks and the curve-fitting (parametric regression) regime, and approach bespoke numerical simulations in accuracy. Unlike numerical simulation, the neural network approach gives generic prediction across a range of structures and sea-states and therefore incurs considerably less computational cost.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Whether trading wool across the Channel to Europe, seeking spices in South Asia or importing sugar from the Caribbean, shipping was an essential resource. Yet, to undertake these trades, merchants required naval supplies – finished ships, timber to build them and stores to fill them – that were not always easily accessible. This challenge was particularly apparent in the early seventeenth century for trading corporations whose specific needs demanded innovative approaches to the naval supply problem. This article examines the responses of English corporations to the challenge of supplying its international shipping by focusing on activities on each side of the Atlantic. First, it assesses the development of the East India Company’s docks at Blackwall and Dundaniel, before turning to a detailed study of ship-building and supply in Virginia and New England. In doing so, this article highlights the importance of naval supply to Britain’s north Atlantic empire, both in terms of the rhetorical support for empire and the economic incentives of participants. This reveals how traditional interpretations of Britain’s naval development have too often focused on state-driven activities (particularly from the very end of the seventeenth century) and failed to examine the complex, sometimes chaotic attempts by private individuals and corporations to overcome the naval supply challenges common to this early period of globalisation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.","Sep 2006","A validated one-dimensional Boussinesq-non-linear shallow water equations numerical model was used to investigate the interaction of solitary waves with beaches. The numerical model requires two adjustable parameters: the bed friction coefficient and a wave breaking parameter. Excellent agreement was achieved between the numerical predictions of solitary wave transformation and run-up at a plane beach with two sets of high-quality laboratory measurements: one a large number of experiments in a wave flume by Synolakis, the other in the UK Coastal Research Facility. A parameter study investigated the effect of uniform offshore water depth, bed friction and bed slope on solitary wave run-up. A uniform water depth may be associated with a continental shelf region. The non-dimensional run-up was found to be an asymptotic function of non-dimensional wave amplitude at high and low values of initial wave steepness. Both asymptotes scale as (R/ho) ∼ α(Ao/h o)β where R is run-up (defined as the vertical elevation reached by the wave uprush above still water level), Ao is the offshore wave amplitude and ho is the uniform depth offshore of the beach. The empirical coefficients α and β depend on the beach characteristics. The model is then used to simulate the interaction of a full-scale tsunami event with an idealised beach profile representative of a beach in Eastern Kamchatka.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Furthermore, evidence collected through a survey instrument addressed to shipping companies located in Greece suggests that the choice of MCS is contingent upon the strategy pursued by the shipping companies. Moreover, this paper tests whether shipping companies with an optimal fit between their strategies and their MCS experience superior business performance and a higher perceived usefulness of MCS. Results reinforce the notion that the performance of the shipping companies is contingent on the use of those control systems which are consistent with their strategies and a number of control variables such as experience of the person implemented the MCS, the size, and age of company. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This article argues that it is therefore unsurprising that the sea also impacted on copper workers in the southern Aegean during the Early Bronze Age. Here, the sea was an integral element of the copper production, which is characterized by movement of metal across the sea from one manufacturing stage to the next—often over considerable distances requiring lengthy absences of the workers from their home communities, making metalworkers true maritime specialists alongside the more “typical” traders, fishermen, and seafarers. The distances traveled magnified the symbolic value of the raw materials as the object’s geographic distance became converted into a symbolic value-added “exotic” distance. This value was further enhanced thanks to the mastery of skills required to traverse the sea, an element very different from land and intimately associated with forgetting, disposal, and death.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

It identifies significant changes in a piece of machinery’s performance, which could be indicative of a developing fault and potentially lead to significant operational cost and even major disruption in manufacturing and production.Implementation of condition monitoring in a typical industrial environment requires support by a system of interconnected software and hardware elements. Traditionally, these systems were developed merely for the specific task of asset health monitoring. However, the digitalisation wave of Industry 4.0 and wider application of artificial intelligence-based (smart) technologies has provided a great opportunity for further development of these systems, thereby making substantial contributions to the efficiency of manufacturing and production.As a part of an Innovate UK-funded project, an intelligent condition monitoring system (called JANUS) was designed and developed in the R&D division of Monition Limited (now RS Components Limited) in order to contribute to operational efficiency, not only by means of reducing asset downtime via more accurate prediction of asset health condition but by more efficient use of technicians/labour resources. In order to meet these objectives, JANUS used machine learning and decision-making algorithms together to form an AI-DSS-based platform for analysis of condition monitoring data.","AI","University of Manchester"

In considering AI diagnostics we suggest that explainability should be explicated as ‘effective contestability’. Taking a patient-centric approach we argue that patients should be able to contest the diagnoses of AI diagnostic systems, and that effective contestation of patient-relevant aspect of AI diagnoses requires the availability of different types of information about 1) the AI system's use of data, 2) the system's potential biases, 3) the system performance, and 4) the division of labour between the system and health care professionals. We justify and define thirteen specific informational requirements that follows from ‘contestability’. We further show not only that contestability is a weaker requirement than some of the proposed criteria of explainability, but also that it does not introduce poorly grounded double standards for AI and health care professionals’ diagnostics, and does not come at the cost of AI system performance. Finally, we briefly discuss whether the contestability requirements introduced here are domain-specific.","AI","University of Manchester"

"Cynical Technical Practice: From AI to APIs","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/cynical-technical-practice-from-ai-to-apis","Hind, S.; Seitz, T.","15 Oct 2022","In this article, we examine how critical thinking, methods and design are used within the tech industry, using Philip Agre’s notion of critical technical practice (CTP) to consider the rise of ‘cynical’ technical practice. Arguments by tech firms that their AI systems are ethical, contextual, situated or fair, as well as APIs that are privacy-compliant and offer greater user control, are now commonplace. Yet, these justifications routinely disguise the organisational, and economic, reasons for the development of technical systems and features. The article considers how different forms of ‘technical critique’ are used by technical practitioners such as software engineers, applying Agre’s work on CTP, AI planning, grammars of action and empowerment to evaluate, and contextualise these justifications. As Agre understood, technical practitioners are not necessarily ‘a-critical’ or ‘uncritical’ in their approach to the design of technological systems or methods, but ordinarily compare the utility or performance of such according to a golden ethic: ‘does it work?’. Drawing on Agre’s studies of AI in the 1990s, the article considers how and what Agre considered to be the ‘Cartesian soul’ of AI research, on linguistic structuralism, and continues to frame much work within the wider tech industry today. Yet increasingly, as the article shows, ‘narrow’ and cynical forms of technical criticality are being used to legitimise, and publicise, corporate strategies of tech firms, whether through the development of AI systems by automotive start-ups such as Comma, or the management of relations with external developers through APIs, in the case of Facebook. Rather than judging the moral character of technical practitioners, however, the article offers an approach – via the work of Philip Agre – to examine how critical thinking is used, and often abused, within and beyond the tech industry.","AI","University of Manchester"

However, there is some skepticism in the web community that AI can be made "web appropriate" and work on a web scale. I will introduce the Semantic Web concept and give a number of examples of how AI has already contributed to its development, primarily through knowledge representation languages. I will explore the reasons why the Semantic Web is a challenging environment for AI.

We argue that the application of relevant artificial intelligence (AI) technology could help address this challenge. Employing interactively prompted narrative storytelling, we investigate the effectiveness of sentiment analysis (SA) on extracting valuable CE insights from primary qualitative data generated via chatbot interviews.Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on a granular and semantically clear framework we developed for studying CE feelings, an AI-augmented chatbot was designed. The chatbot interviewed a crowdsourced sample of consumers about their recalled service experience feelings. By combining free-text and closed-ended questions, we were able to compare extracted sentiment polarities against established measurement scales and empirically validate our novel approach.Findings – We demonstrate that SA can effectively extract CE feelings from primary chatbot data. Our findings also suggest that further enhancement in accuracy can be achieved via improvements in the interplay between the chatbot interviewer and SA extraction algorithms.Research limitations/implications – The proposed customer-centric approach can help service companies to study and better understand CE feelings in a cost-effective and scalable manner. The AI-augmented chatbots can also help companies foster immersive and engaging relationships with customers. Our study focuses on feelings, warranting further research on AI’s value in studying other CE elements.Originality/value – The unique inquisitive role of AI-infused chatbots in conducting interviews and analyzing data in realtime, offers considerable potential for studying CE and other subjective constructs.","AI","University of Manchester"

Reward gaming occurs when the agent's reward function is mis-specified and the agent can achieve a high reward by altering or fooling, in some way, its sensors rather than by performing the desired actions. Our first heuristic tracks the rewards encountered in the environment and converts high rewards that fall outside the normal distribution into penalities. Our second heuristic relies on the existence of some validation action that an agent can take to check the reward. In this heuristic, on encountering an abnormally high reward, the agent performs a validation step before either accepting the reward as it is, or converting it into a penalty. We evaluate the performance of these heuristics on variants of the tomato watering problem from the AI Safety Gridworlds suite.","AI","University of Manchester"

Certainly it could, with benefit, replace serum cholesterol and HDL cholesterol in the estimation of CVD risk. Defining the therapeutic target of statin therapy in terms of serum apolipoprotein B (apo B) rather than LDL cholesterol could also help to optimize statin treatment. Deciding whether a therapeutic response is adequate also requires knowledge of whether there is persisting hypertriglyceridaemia, because this gives an indication of whether small dense LDL is likely to have been satisfactorily reduced. Raising low levels of HDL, probably best measured as apo AI, may also prove to be an important aim of treatment. This is, however, a more complex issue and also depends on the mechanism by which a particular therapy alters HDL levels and on whether the capacity of HDL to perform its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative functions is restored.

Complex ML models provide good prediction accuracy; however, the opacity of ML models does not provide sufficient assurance for their adoption in the automation of lending decisions. This paper presents an explainable AI decision-support-system to automate the loan underwriting process by belief-rule-base (BRB). This system can accommodate human knowledge and can also learn from historical data by supervised learning. The hierarchical structure of BRB can accommodates factual and heuristic rules. The system can explain the chain of events leading to a decision for a loan application by the importance of an activated rule and the contribution of antecedent attributes in the rule. A business case study on automation of mortgage underwriting is demonstrated to show that the BRB system can provide a good trade-off between accuracy and explainability. The textual explanation produced by the activation of rules could be used as a reason for denial of a loan. The decision-making process for an application can be comprehended by the significance of rules in providing the decision and contribution of its antecedent attributes.","AI","University of Manchester"

An emerging technique to address these concerns is the use of explainability. In this paper we present the results of an interview study with nuclear industry experts to explore the use of explainable intelligent systems within the field. We interviewed 16 participants with varying backgrounds of expertise, and presented two potential use cases for evaluation; a navigation scenario and a task scheduling scenario.

An emerging technique to address these concerns is the use of explainability. In this paper we present the results of an interview study with nuclear industry experts to explore the use of explainable intelligent systems within the field. We interviewed 16 participants with varying backgrounds of expertise, and presented two potential use cases for evaluation; a navigation scenario and a task scheduling scenario.

"Trading off accuracy and explainability in AI decision-making: findings from 2 citizens’ juries","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/trading-off-accuracy-and-explainability-in-ai-decision-making-fin","van der Veer, S.; Riste, L.; Cheraghi-Sohi, S.; Phipps, D.; Tully, M.; Bozentko, K.; Atwood, S.; Hubbard, A.; Wiper, C.; Oswald, M.; Peek, N.","18 Sep 2021","OBJECTIVETo investigate how the general public trades off explainability versus accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and whether this differs between healthcare and non-healthcare scenarios.MATERIALS AND METHODSCitizens’ juries are a form of deliberative democracy eliciting informed judgment from a representative sample of the general public around policy questions. We organized two 5-day citizens’ juries in the UK with 18 jurors each. Jurors considered 3 AI systems with different levels of accuracy and explainability in 2 healthcare and 2 non-healthcare scenarios. Per scenario, jurors voted for their preferred system; votes were analyzed descriptively. Qualitative data on considerations behind their preferences included transcribed audio-recordings of plenary sessions, observational field notes, outputs from small group work and free-text comments accompanying jurors’ votes; qualitative data were analyzed thematically by scenario, per and across AI systems.RESULTSIn healthcare scenarios, jurors favored accuracy over explainability, whereas in non-healthcare contexts they either valued explainability equally to, or more than, accuracy. Jurors’ considerations in favor of accuracy regarded the impact of decisions on individuals and society, and the potential to increase efficiency of services. Reasons for emphasizing explainability included increased opportunities for individuals and society to learn and improve future prospects and enhanced ability for humans to identify and resolve system biases.CONCLUSIONCitizens may value explainability of AI systems in healthcare less than in non-healthcare domains and less than often assumed by professionals, especially when weighed against system accuracy. The public should therefore be actively consulted when developing policy on AI explainability.","AI","University of Manchester"

With well-designed algorithmic steps, AI can provide guidance that is independent of subjective judgements biased by shareholder short-termism and board opportunism.

In the USA, more COVID related deaths have been reported than the combined fatalities of the Pearl Harbor War and the September 11 terror attacks. COVID-19 itself is highly infectious and the speed at which it can mutate is rapid, leading to multiple varieties and strands of active coronaviruses, and rapid increases in the numbers of infected cases and deaths. The virus has infected more than 217 million of the population worldwide before the end of August 2021, yet in early March 2020, the total infected cases were still not reaching 100,000 (WHO, 2021).The global challenge has changed how we live, with social distancing measures and face masks mandates, and has shone a spotlight on our healthcare capabilities, highlighting shortages of medical resources and capacity, and raising issues of equitable access to vaccines and drugs. Governments of different countries have been challenged to deal with the crisis using limited resources and have emphasized different policies suiting their national strategies (Ecke, 2020; Ranney et al., 2020).Machine Learning, AI and Big Data research, scientists can offer recommendations, new discoveries and predictive methods in addressing both societal impact (Gupta et al., 2018) and medical services (van der Sommen et al., 2020). Big Data and cloud computing (Chang, 2014; Hosseinian-Far et al., 2018), the Internet of Things (Sicari et al., 2016), and Artificial Intelligence techniques (Vaishya et al., 2020) have significantly contributed to developing an understanding of the virus, identifying and developing treatments and managing and tracking the social and economic impact of the pandemic, and predicting trends (Tuli et al., 2020). Scientists can better understand the structure and weaknesses of virus variants through simulations offered by ML algorithms, leading to vaccine development with higher efficacy (Rotondo et al., 2021). Challenges addressed range from COVID-19 diagnosis and infection confirmation based on a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Kim et al., 2020) to privacy protection and secure transmission of messages among medical professionals (Wang et al., 2020).","AI","University of Manchester"

During this transition, people’s intention to use AI technologies is still unclear and emotions such as fear are influencing it. In this paper, we focus on autonomous cars to first verify empirically the extent to which people fear AI and then examine the impact that fear has on their intention to use AI-driven vehicles. Our research is based on a systematic survey and it reveals that while individuals are largely afraid of cars that are driven by AI, they are nonetheless willing to adopt this technology as soon as possible. To explain this tension, we extend our analysis beyond just fear and show that people also believe that AI-driven cars will generate many individual, urban and global benefits. Subsequently, we employ our empirical findings as the foundations of a theoretical framework meant to illustrate the main factors that people ponder when they consider the use of AI tech. In addition to offering a comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of AI technology acceptance, this paper provides a nuanced understanding of the tension that exists between the fear and adoption of AI, capturing what exactly people fear and intend to do.","AI","University of Manchester"

While Buber introduces the idea of dialogic space, an idea which has proved useful for the analysis of dialogic education with technology, his account fails to engage adequately with the role of technology. This paper offers an introduction to the significance of the I-It/I-Thou duality of technology in relation with opening dialogic space. This is followed by a short schematic history of educational technology which reveals the role technology plays, not only in opening dialogic space, but also in expanding dialogic space. The expansion of dialogic space is an expansion of what it means to be ‘us’ as dialogic engagement facilitates the incorporation, into our shared sense of identity, of aspects of reality that are initially experienced as alien or ‘other’. Augmenting Buber with an alternative understanding of dialogic space enables us to see how dialogue mediated by technology, as well as dialogue with monologised fragments of technology (robots), can, through education, lead to an expansion of what it means to be human.","AI","University of Manchester"

Current treatments for AAD mainly focus on targeting AI and its contribution AHR, with the use of corticosteroids. However, there are no therapies for the direct treatment of AWR, which can contribute to airway obstruction, AHR and corticosteroid resistance independently of AI. The acute heart failure drug, serelaxin (recombinant human gene-2 relaxin, RLX), has potential anti-remodeling and anti-fibrotic effects but only when continuously infused or injected to overcome its short half-life. To alleviate this limitation, we conjugated serelaxin to biodegradable and noninflammatory nanoparticles (NP-RLX) and evaluated their therapeutic potential on measures of AI, AWR and AHR, when intranasally delivered to a preclinical rodent model of chronic AAD and TGF-β1-stimulated collagen gel contraction from asthma patient-derived myofibroblasts. NP-RLX was preferentially taken-up by CD206+-infiltrating and CD68+-tissue resident alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, NP-RLX ameliorated the chronic AAD-induced AI, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), chemokines (CCL2, CCL11) and the pro-fibrotic TGF-β1/IL-1β axis on AWR and resulting AHR, as well as human myofibroblast-induced collagen gel contraction, to a similar extent as unconjugated RLX. Hence, NP-RLX represents a novel strategy for treating the central features of asthma.","AI","University of Manchester"

It is argued here that the trial offers a prism through which to explore wider anxieties that the generation who fought the Second World War held during the late 1960s. It maps how contemporary generational tensions, fears of national decline, and concerns about distorted cultural representations of war in Britain were embedded into the trial. This libel case thus became invested with considerable cultural significance among an ageing community of wartime survivors who were intent upon safeguarding wider memories of ‘their’ war.","Navy","University of Manchester"

In particular, historians have overlooked the division between the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. Yet portrayals of the two navies differed widely. Maritime films both during and after the war followed a well-established tradition of representing the navy as a force of disciplined and respectable men led by gentlemen heroes that reliably defended nation and empire. Such representations rarely acknowledged the existence of the Merchant Navy with its globally recruited and racially mixed workforce and its troubling associations with indiscipline. Yet naval operations largely concerned its protection, and the British war effort depended on the goods it transported. In the context of the leftward drift of wartime politics, the Merchant Navy received rare attention in a 1943 film that nevertheless avoided depicting non-white merchant seaman or disturbing the gender division. After the war the focus of maritime films returned to the Royal Navy. The liminal presence of the Merchant Navy in films of the 1950s was, however, significant. It was, variously, the vector for the expression of British insecurities about the wartime victory, the occasion for the portrayal of the enemy as an honourable foe, and a means to both romanticize, and hint at the fragility of, imperial masculinity. © The Author [2011].

From 1592 to 1598, the Chosŏn dynasty suffered invasions from Japan that displaced much of the Korean population and devastated the economy and environment. The crucial role of the navy during the war, along with a dire postwar situation, heightened government anxieties about deforestation and timber scarcity. Thus, in the seventeenth century, the Chosŏn government expanded administration over forests, particularly pine forests, across the coasts and islands of southwestern Korea. The key vehicle for the expansion was the military. Due to wartime and postwar exigencies, the military became the late Chosŏn state’s primary organ for management of wood resources for state purposes. Furthermore, the growth of pine-centric state forests and shifts in military priorities would significantly reshape Korean ecologies.","Navy","University of Manchester"

M.; Mol, J. M. C.","1 Jun 2016","Despite over 40 years of research, the optimum methods for the analysis of electrochemical noise data remain uncertain. One class of methods examine the frequency content of the noise signal. The first such method to be used was conventional spectral analysis, initially using the Fourier Transform, and subsequently the Maximum Entropy Method. Apart from questions over the relative merits of the two methods, the estimation of the power spectrum suffers from the formal requirement that the signal being analysed is stationary, since corrosion processes are frequently non-stationary. This has lead to the use of alternative analysis methods that do not require the signal to be stationary, including wavelet analysis and, more recently, the Hilbert-Huang transform. It is not always appreciated that the wavelet method was developed as an extension of the Fourier transform and that there is a close relationship between the two methods. This paper will explore this relationship and implications for the analysis of electrochemical noise.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Did popular nationalism influence the PRC’s military escalation? A lack of transparency in elite Chinese decision-making puts a definitive answer to this question beyond our reach. However, this article utilizes qualitative and quantitative analyses of anti-Japanese discourse and deeds in both cyberspace and on the streets of urban China to argue that the circumstantial evidence is compelling: nationalist opinion is a powerful driver of China’s Japan policy. The demands of nationalist legitimation appear to pressure the elite to respond to popular nationalism. Should one or more Chinese die at the hands of the Japanese navy or air force, therefore, the popular pressure for escalation and war will likely be more than China’s leaders can manage.","Navy","University of Manchester"

M.; Mol, J. M. C.","2016","Transients in electrochemical noise (EN) signals that are associated with localized corrosion typically contain frequency information that is quite localized in time. The study of these transients is therefore preferably performed using analysis procedures with high discrimination ability in both time and frequency simultaneously. The present work studies the combination of the Hilbert-Huang transform with the continuous wavelet transform, as data analysis methods that operate in time as well as in frequency, for the identification of localized corrosion. Additionally it incorporates fast Fourier transform as a technique to determine the distribution of power over frequency. Finally, it integrates the study of transient shape into the analysis of (time-) frequency properties. It is shown that the maxima in instantaneous frequency amplitudes of transients with otherwise different shapes can be similar. In the case of the presence of multiple transients in the EN signal, the cut-off frequency obtained from power spectral density plots is related to maxima in instantaneous frequency amplitudes of only a limited number of transients.","Navy","University of Manchester"

"Oceanic seismotectonics from regional earthquake recordings: the 4-5˚N Mid-Atlantic Ridge","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/oceanic-seismotectonics-from-regional-earthquake-recordings-the-4","de Melo, G. W. S.; Mitchell, N.; Zahradnik, J.; Dias, F.; do Nascimento, A. F.","20 Nov 2021","Uncertainties in epicentral locations and hypocentral depths often prevent earthquakes from being associated with individual or group of faults in bathymetric data, thus limiting the understanding of tectonic behavior. Ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) can overcome this problem, but they take significant efforts to build and deploy, so information from them covers only a minor part of the earthquake record of mid-ocean ridges. As an alternative, a combination of records from seismometers at regional distances and appropriate processing methods can yield location and depth estimates that are useful because they provide extensive data. We illustrate this with a study of magnitude of the seismicity in the 4–5°N Mid-Atlantic Ridge using data from seismometers in Brazil, Cape Verdes, and Africa coast. The seismicity occurred in swarms in 2012 (seven events), 2014 (five events), 2016 (62 events), and 2019 (eight events). We compare the seismicity with features using bathymetric data collected with a multibeam sonars, which reveal two detachment fault surfaces (“megamullions”), one close to the modern rift valley floor but offset by ~10 km from it. The located seismicity is shallow (best estimate less than 8 km below seafloor). The swarms occurred over two segments of the ridge and, in the 2016 case, clearly involved movements on widely distributed multiple faults, including faults on both sides of the valley. Although the methods used produce epicenters and hypocenters with uncertainties that are still larger than those of OBS experiments, they could provide a way to study whether seismicity is systematically deep in certain parts of the ridge where megamullions are observed.","Navy","University of Manchester"

One of the towering figures of this epoch is W.V. Quine (1908-2000), champion of naturalism in philosophy of science, pioneer of mathematical logic, trying to unite an austerely physicalist theory of the world with the truths of mathematics, psychology, and linguistics. Quine's posthumous papers, notes, and drafts revealing the development of his views in the forties have recently begun to be published, as well as careful philosophical studies of, for instance, the evolution of his key doctrine that mathematical and logical truth are continuous with, not divorced from, the truths of natural science. But one central text has remained unexplored: Quine's Portuguese-language book on logic, his 'farewell for now' to the discipline as he embarked on an assignment in the Navy in WWII. Anglophone philosophers have neglected this book because they could not read it. Jointly with colleagues, I have completed the first full English translation of this book. In this accompanying paper I  draw out the main philosophical contributions Quine made in the book, placing them in their historical context and relating them to Quine's overall philosophical development during the period. Besides significant developments in the evolution of Quine's views on meaning and analyticity, I argue, this book is also driven by Quine's indebtedness to Russell and Whitehead, Tarski, and Frege, and contains crucial developments in his thinking on philosophy of logic and ontology. This includes early versions of some arguments from 'On What There Is', four-dimensionalism, and virtual set theory.","Navy","University of Manchester"

This article draws on a concept of popular memory that suggests that rival versions of the past compete for cultural centrality, to ask how Dunkirk acquired this position. During the war, accounts stressed the importance of the sea in the 'deliverance', but while some focused on the Navy, others concentrated on the civilian small boats, and criticism was rare. Immediately postwar there was a lull in representations. In the 1950s, attention switched to the land and to the problematic place of the defeated Army in the story, culminating in Ealing Studios' film Dunkirk (1958). Ealing attempted to synthesize previous emphases and struggled to achieve agreement about the representation of the evacuation. The film ensured the public prominence of the memory of Dunkirk, yet its reception was fractured along class and gender lines, indicating the instabilities of Ealing's negotiated consensus. The history of the contested inscription of Dunkirk in British culture emphasizes that at no point since the events occurred has the representation of the second world war been secure; the popular memory of the war is continually subject to construction, contestation and revision. © 2010 The Author.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Shifts in ownership from the state to private hands or pious foundations put further stress on the state’s traditional fiscal base. Christ argues that the sultans increased taxation and state intervention in response, and thus that control of the international transit trade turned out to be particularly profitable. In order to tap it more effectively, the Mamluk sultanate reinforced ties with the Venetians in the Mediterranean and the Rasulids in the Red Sea. Relations were grounded in an ambiguous language of gift exchange which allowed for the harmonization of nominal hierarchical difference and de facto bilateral, symbiotic exchange. On the basis of shared trade interests, the Mamluks delegated power over the ‘Two Seas’. This delegation was not perfect though; the Mamluks also sought to establish a direct if only seasonal fiscal presence in the Egyptian gateways of this trade in Alexandria, Upper Egypt and the Hijaz , thus combining delegation on the seas with tighter control in the ports in order to channel the lucrative transit trade through their Cairo power base.","Navy","University of Manchester"

We used two analysis techniques with independent estimates of the noise mmodels for the pulsar observations and different algorithms for obtaining the pulsar timescale. The two analyses agree within the estimated uncertainties and both agree with TT(BIPM17), a post-corrected timescale produced by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). We show that both methods could detect significant errors in TT(BIPM17) if they were present. We estimate the stability of the atomic clocks from which TT(BIPM17) is derived using observations of four rubidium fountain clocks at the US Naval Observatory. Comparing the power spectrum of TT(IPTA16) with that of these fountain clocks suggests that pulsar-based timescales are unlikely to contribute to the stability of the best timescales over the next decade, but they will remain a valuable independent check on atomic timescales. We also find that the stability of the pulsar-based timescale is likely to be limited by our knowledge of solar-system dynamics, and that errors in TT(BIPM17) will not be a limiting factor for the primary goal of the IPTA, which is to search for the signatures of nano-Hertz gravitational waves.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Ground-based measurements are from the CalNex Pasadena ground site, and airborne measurements took place onboard the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Navy Twin Otter and the NOAA WP-3D aircraft. BC predictions are in general agreement with observations at the Pasadena ground site and onboard the WP-3D, but are consistently overpredicted when compared to Twin Otter measurements. Adjustments to predicted inorganic mass concentrations, based on predicted aerosol size distributions and the AMS transmission efficiency, are shown to be significant. Owing to recent shipping emission reductions, the dominant source of sulfate in the L.A. Basin may now be long-range transport. Sensitivity studies suggest that severely underestimated ammonia emissions, and not the exclusion of crustal species (Ca2 +, K+, and Mg2 +), are the single largest contributor to measurement/model disagreement in the eastern part of the L.A. Basin. Despite overstated NOx emissions, total nitrate concentrations are underpredicted, which suggests a missing source of HNO 3 and/or overprediction of deposition rates. Adding gas-phase NH 3 measurements and size-resolved measurements, up to 10 μm, of nitrate and various cations (e.g. Na+, Ca2 +, K +) to routine monitoring stations in the L.A.

R.; Volt, F.; Wynn, R.; Lee, S. J.; Horowitz, M. M.; Gluckman, E.; Ruggeri, A.","Jul 2017","Background The standard for selecting unrelated umbilical cord blood units for transplantation for non-malignant diseases relies on antigen-level (lower resolution) HLA typing for HLA-A and HLA-B, and allele-level for HLA-DRB1. We aimed to study the effects of allele-level matching at a higher resolution—HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1, which is the standard used for adult unrelated volunteer donor transplantation for non-malignant diseases—for umbilical cord blood transplantation. Methods We retrospectively studied 1199 paediatric donor-recipient pairs with allele-level HLA matching who received a single unit umbilical cord blood transplantation for non-malignant diseases reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research or Eurocord and European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant. Transplantations occurred between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2012. The primary outcome was overall survival. The effect of HLA matching on survival was studied using a Cox regression model. Findings Compared with HLA-matched transplantations, mortality was higher with transplantations mismatched at two (hazard ratio [HR] 1·55, 95% CI 1·08–2·21, p=0·018), three (2·04, 1·44–2·89, p=0·0001), and four or more alleles (3·15, 2·16–4·58, p<0·0001). There were no significant differences in mortality between transplantations that were matched and mismatched at one allele (HR 1·18, 95% CI 0·80–1·72, p=0·39). Other factors associated with higher mortality included recipient cytomegalovirus seropositivity (HR 1·40, 95% CI 1·13–1·74, p=0·0020), reduced intensity compared with myeloablative conditioning regimens (HR 1·36, 1·10–1·68, p=0·0041), transplantation of units with total nucleated cell dose of more than 21 × 107 cells per kg compared with 21 × 107 cells per kg or less (HR 1·47, 1·11–1·95, p=0·0076), and transplantations done in 2000–05 compared with those done in 2006–12 (HR 1·64, 1·31–2·04, p<0·0001). The 5-year overall survival adjusted for recipient cytomegalovirus serostatus, conditioning regimen intensity, total nucleated cell dose, and transplantation period was 79% (95% CI 74–85) after HLA matched, 76% (71–81) after one allele mismatched, 70% (65–75) after two alleles mismatched, 62% (57–68) after three alleles mismatched, and 49% (41–57) after four or more alleles mismatched transplantations. Graft failure was the predominant cause of mortality. Interpretation These data support a change from current practice in that selection of unrelated umbilical cord blood units for transplantation for non-malignant diseases should consider allele-level HLA matching at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1.

The enactment of the National Defence Policy resulted in an increase in defence expenditure in Brazil that was primarily focused on developing and buying modern equipment and paying better salaries. The policy was implemented during three investment cycles that began with off-the-shelf acquisitions and moved to the execution of defence programmes aiming to develop indigenous technologies, substituting imports on the way. Despite the effort, we argue that the most likely scenario is that the achievement of the vision established in the National Defence Policy will be compromised, and that constant delays caused by the expenditure constraints might result in the delivery of outdated technologies and weapon systems, keeping a never-ending technological gap.","Navy","University of Manchester"

This paper uses the method of risk analysis to discuss defence procurement challenges in India. An original dataset of 88 contracts has been created to identify the most probable and the most severe causes for poor procurement performance. A schedule performance parameter has been constructed to quantify the impact of different adverse events. The findings display a high probability of technological risks followed by contractual risks as the cause for delays in Indian defence procurement. Technological risks are concentrated in cases of indigenous procurement, due to a lack of infrastructure and resources, while contractual risks mostly occur in contracts where the Ministry of Defence deals with external agents like foreign suppliers. This indicates frictions and transaction costs. These and other findings from the quantitative data on procurement performance are supplemented by insights from an extensive fieldwork in India which included 53 interviews.","Navy","University of Manchester"

It suspended the convertibility of the Bank of England's notes into gold, a policy that lasted until 1821. The current historical consensus is that it was a result of the state's need to finance the war, France’s remonetization, a loss of confidence in the English country banks, and a run on the Bank of England’s reserves following a landing of French troops in Wales. We argue that while these factors help us understand the timing of the suspension, they cannot explain its success.

Once the final colour is chosen, most of the problems associated with delivering the colour selected, under precise colour definition and control, at a reasonable cost, have been solved. Technical colour management is well served by accurate measurement and colour manipulation tools, and is founded on tried and tested science. By contrast, those managers whose responsibility it is to deliver successful colour selection, cannot appeal to much more than general principles, the dictates of fashion and intuition: they have very few tools and measurement techniques to assist them. Colour influences all aspects of our lives, from the clothes we wear and the food we eat to the environment in which we work [2]. The colour of an item of apparel worn by someone has an impact on how they are perceived by others and how they perceive themselves. This means that consumers are extremely sensitive to colour when choosing apparel goods. The rapid development of computers and information processing technology offers the prospect of bringing together hitherto fragmentary knowledge and precision colour technology in a concerted effort to improve the process of optimising product colour.

Including a link to one of the few examples of his work to survive ('White Fawn's Devotion' from 1910), the post highlights the fact that Young Deer strove to oppose the emerging stereotype in popular culture of Native Americans as savage unreasoning killers to present them as civilised and capable of mercy and love. The recently-solved mystery of Young Deer's own racial background is also examined, revealing him as genuinely Native American even though he had been officially designated as 'mulatto'.","Navy","University of Manchester"

S.","15 Jul 2019","Between 1500 and 1800 CE, patterns of governance on the Korean peninsula shifted toward a dynamic that I term the “rise of the brokered state.” While central political authority increasingly became entrenched in a small number of elite families residing in the capital region, the reach of the Chosŏn state continued to grow through local institutions such as clerks and military garrisons. Likewise, avenues of interaction between Seoul and the provinces broadened thanks to the social and organizational consolidation of local elites. Over time, the government was able to utilize a widening assemblage of bureaucratic administration and local cooperation to expand state management of resources such as grain and timber. Previous scholarship has often situated Chosŏn center-local dynamics within vectors of conflict, stagnation, or progress. My analysis reframes Chosŏn administrative expansion as an interactive process through which a wide array of local yangban, clerks, military officials, and monks became key intermediaries between the central government and the provinces, in turn forming the infrastructural contours of the Chosŏn state itself.","Navy","University of Manchester"

The two-stage cascade allows for increased separation selectivity whilst the integrated solvent recovery stage mitigates the otherwise large solvent consumption of the purification. This work explores the effect of washing the solvent recovery unit at intervals in order to attain high product purities with imperfect solvent recovery membranes possessing less than 100% rejection of the impurity. This operation attains a purity of 98.7% through semi-continuous operation with two washes of the solvent recovery stage, even when imperfect membranes are used in a closed-loop set-up. This contrasts favourably with the 83.0% maximum purity achievable in a similar set-up with a single continuous run. The process achieves slightly lower (−0.7%) yield of around 98.2% compared to a continuously operated process without solvent recovery but consumes approx. 85% less solvent (theoretical analysis suggests up to 96% reduction is possible). 9 different membranes, both commercial (GMT, Novamem, SolSep) and in-house fabricated, are screened and tested on a separation challenge associated with the synthesis of macrocycles – amongst the membrane materials are polyimide (PI), polybenzimidazole (PBI) and, polyetheretherketone (PEEK).","Navy","University of Manchester"

These areas play a vital role in the transfer of sediment through deep-water systems. Extensive outcrop exposures in the Karoo Basin, South Africa, permit investigation of the depositional architecture and evolution of entirely exhumed dip transects of a channel-lobe transition zone for the first time. Furthermore, the excellent paleogeographic constraint allows correlation to genetically related updip channel-levee systems and downdip lobe deposits over 40 km, with strike control over 20 km. Unlike the single time slice afforded by modern systems, the Karoo example uniquely allows study of the temporal shifting of the channel-lobe transition zone and transfer into the stratigraphic record. Key lateral changes along the base of slope include the variation from an interfingering levee-lobe transition zone to a bypass-dominated channel-lobe transition zone over a width of 14 km. Key recognition criteria for channel-lobe transition zones in the ancient record include combinations of scours and megaflutes, composite erosional surfaces, mudstone clast/coarse-grained sediment lags, and remnants of depositional bed forms, such as sediment waves. Documented here in a single channel-lobe transition zone, these features are arranged in a zone of juxtaposed remnant erosional and depositional features. The zone reaches 6 km in length, formed by at least four stages of expansion/contraction or migration. Strike variations and changes in the dimensions of the channel-lobe transition zone through time are interpreted to be the result of physiographic changes and variations in flow dynamics across the base of slope. The dynamic nature of channellobe transition zones results in complicated and composite stratigraphy, with preservation potential generally low but increasing distally and laterally away from the mouth of the feeder channel system. Here, we present the first generic model to account for dynamic channel-lobe transition zone development, encompassing distinctive recognition criteria, fluctuations in the morphology and position of the zone, and the complex transfer into the sedimentary record.","Navy","University of Manchester"
"Land of Opportunity? The Assimilation of Scottish Migrants in England, 1603-c.1762","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/land-of-opportunity-the-assimilation-of-scottish-migrants-in-engl","Brown, K.; Kennedy, A.","2018","Immigration and its consequences is one of the most contentious issues in the contemporary world, and historians are engaged in this debate by offering a longer-term perspective. In recent years, research on the United Kingdom's population has placed greater emphasis on population movement in shaping Britain's story, identifying waves of migrants from elsewhere alongside migration within Britain. One neglected aspect of this narrative, however, is the migration of Scots to England, particularly in the age of the regal and parliamentary union, when the changing political relationship between the two kingdoms had an impact on the scale, geographic spread, and opportunities and obstacles of that migration. While a minority of Scottish migrants were unwelcome, or chose to return home, the overwhelming weight of evidence is for those migrants who remained in England. The focus in this article is on that majority group for whom migration was a positive experience, thus raising questions about why these Scots were so successful and why they faced so little native opposition. That process of segmented assimilation offers an insight into the formation of Britain and the shifting ground of national identity associated with the emerging British state. The Scots, moreover, provide a model for “successful” migration, suggesting that a range of factors—principally, an educated, culturally malleable, and economically responsive migrant population, alongside an institutionally and attitudinally flexible host community—need to be in place in order to optimize the chances of migrant assimilation","Navy","University of Manchester"

"“Grateful” Children and “Humanitarian” Marines: Georgette “Dickey” Chapelle’s Vietnam Photography, 1962","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/grateful-children-and-humanitarian-marines-georgette-dickey-chape","Vesma, G.","5 Jul 2021","This article explores how one female photographer, Georgette ‘Dickey’ Chapelle (1918–1965), used children’s emotions as visual and rhetorical justification for early ‘advisory’ actions in Vietnam by the United States, situating the presence of U.S. Marines in Vietnam as ‘humanitarian’. Children are a common subject for ‘humanitarian photography’, mobilising an emotional response and justifying certain actions as humanitarian (Fehrenbach and Rodogno, Humanitarian Photography: A History. Cambridge University Press, 2015). War photography studies have explored the creation of a ‘humanitarian soldier' to justify colonising conflicts in the twenty-first century (Parry, Media, Culture and Society 33 (8): 1185–1201, 2011; Kotilainen, “Humanitarian Soldiers, Colonialised Others and Invisible Enemies-Visual Strategic Communication Narratives of the Afghan War.” FIIA Working Paper, 2011). This paper brings these ideas to a case study from the Vietnam War era, emphasising the role of emotional constructions in the production of such ‘humanitarian’ interpretations of military activity. In her article for National Geographic, “Helicopter War in Viet Nam,” Chapelle focused on interactions between uniformed American men and Vietnamese children, whom she portrayed as grateful recipients of airlifts, clothing and medical treatment. Chapelle used children to symbolise South Vietnam, reflecting political discourses in the United States that presented Vietnam as a ‘childlike’ nation in need of ‘rescue’. While many photographs of children from the Vietnam War era were used as evidence of the moral indefensibility of the conflict, this paper argues that Chapelle’s photographs from the Mekong Delta in 1962 portray Vietnam as ‘childlike’ to justify American intervention in Vietnam as ‘humanitarian’.","Navy","University of Manchester"

This paper explores the contested yet symbiotic relationship of management and the military, via a discussion of the Vietnam conflict and contemporary debates over restructuring the U.S. military to fight so-called ‘New Wars’. It portrays a complex picture of the organization and measurement of destruction, arguing that managerialism has long been an important ideological element of civilian and military practice. While management systems such as the infamous ‘measurements of progress’ in the Vietnam War were practically dysfunctional they were effective up to a point in their managerialist goal of portraying civilian and military organizations as effective, evidence-based, progressive and ethical. This logic also pertains to contemporary debates over ‘progress’ and its measurement in the Iraq and Afghanistan counterinsurgencies and the campaign against Isil. Despite its practical limitations, managerialism is highly prevalent as ideology in warfare, fixating on tactical and operational levels thereby excluding broader strategic, political or ethical discussions. ‘Progress’ and its mismeasurement in Vietnam and the New Wars are therefore best understood not simply as reasons for military and civilian failures in prolonged and inconclusive conflicts, but as evidence of the success of managerialism in restricting public scrutiny and accountability of the business of war.","Navy","University of Manchester"

A.; Durkan, C.","2019","Fouling of oil-exposed surfaces remains a crucial issue due to the continued importance of oil as the world’s primary energy source. The key perpetrators in crude oil fouling have been identified as asphaltenes, a poorly-described mixture of diverse polyfunctional molecules that form part of the heaviest fractions of oil. Asphaltenes are responsible for a decrease in oil production and energy efficiency, and an increase in the risk of environmental hazards. Hence, understanding and managing systems that are prone to fouling is of great value but constitutes a challenge due to their complexity. In an effort to reduce that complexity, a study of a synthesised foulant of archipelago structure is presented. An alternative perspective on previously described solubility and aggregation mechanisms (eg. Critical Nanoaggrerate Concentration, Critical Clustering Concentration) is offered since the characterised system favours a continuous distribution of n-mers instead. A battery of experimental and modelling techniques have been employed to link the bulk and interfacial behaviour of a representative foulant monomer to effective fouling mitigation strategies. This systematic approach defines a new multiscale methodology in the investigation of fouling systems.","Navy","University of Manchester"

The ability to recognize and classify activities can help in the objective monitoring of health and wellness trends in ageing adults. While the use of video and stereo cameras for monitoring activities provides an adequate insight, the privacy of users is not fully protected (i.e., users can easily be recognized from the images). Another concern is that widely used wearable sensors, such as accelerometers, have some disadvantages, such as limited battery life, adoption issues and wearability. This study investigates the use of low-cost thermal sensing solutions capable of generating distinct thermal blobs with timestamps to recognize the activities of study participants. More than 11,000 thermal blobs were recorded from 10 healthy participants with two thermal sensors placed in a laboratory kitchen: (i) one mounted on the ceiling, and (ii) the other positioned on a mini tripod stand in the corner of the room. Furthermore, data from the ceiling thermal sensor were fused with data gleaned from the lateral thermal sensor. Contact sensors were used at each stage as the gold standard for timestamp approximation during data acquisition, which allowed the attainment of: (i) the time at which each activity took place, (ii) the type of activity performed, and (iii) the location of each participant. Experimental results demonstrated successful cluster-based activity recognition and classification with an average regression co-efficient of 0.95 for tested clusters and features. Also, an average accuracy of 95% was obtained for data mining models such as k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, neural network and random forest on Evaluation Test.Clinical Relevance-This study presents an unobtrusive (i.e., privacy-friendly) solution for activity recognition and classification, for the purposes of profiling trends in health and wellbeing.","Navy","University of Manchester"

ML can perform tasks (e.g. categorisation, decision making, anomaly detection, etc.) through experience and without explicit instruction, even when the data are too vast, complex, highly variable, full of errors to be analysed in other ways. Thus, ML is great for natural language, images, or other complex and messy data available in large and growing volumes. Selecting ML models for tasks depends on many factors as they vary in supervision needed, tolerable error levels, and ability to account for order or temporal context, among many other things. Importantly, ML methods for tasks that use explicitly ordered or time-dependent data struggle with errors or data asymmetry. Most data are (implicitly) ordered or time-dependent, potentially allowing a hidden ‘arrow of time’ to affect ML performance on non-temporal tasks. This research explores the interaction of ML and implicit order using two ML models to automatically classify (a non temporal task) Tweets (temporal data) under conditions that balance volume and complexity ofdata. Results show performance was affected, suggesting researchers should carefully consider time when matching appropriate ML models to tasks, even when time is only implicitly included.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

"Clinical Text Data in Machine Learning: Systematic Review","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/clinical-text-data-in-machine-learning-systematic-review","Nenadic, G.","31 Mar 2020","Background: Clinical narratives represent the main form of communication within health care, providing a personalized account of patient history and assessments, and offering rich information for clinical decision making. Natural language processing (NLP) has repeatedly demonstrated its feasibility to unlock evidence buried in clinical narratives. Machine learning can facilitate rapid development of NLP tools by leveraging large amounts of text data.Objective: The main aim of this study was to provide systematic evidence on the properties of text data used to train machine learning approaches to clinical NLP. We also investigated the types of NLP tasks that have been supported by machine learning and how they can be applied in clinical practice.Methods: Our methodology was based on the guidelines for performing systematic reviews. In August 2018, we used PubMed, a multifaceted interface, to perform a literature search against MEDLINE. We identified 110 relevant studies and extracted information about text data used to support machine learning, NLP tasks supported, and their clinical applications. The data properties considered included their size, provenance, collection methods, annotation, and any relevant statistics.Results: The majority of datasets used to train machine learning models included only hundreds or thousands of documents. Only 10 studies used tens of thousands of documents, with a handful of studies utilizing more. Relatively small datasets were utilized for training even when much larger datasets were available. The main reason for such poor data utilization is the annotation bottleneck faced by supervised machine learning algorithms. Active learning was explored to iteratively sample a subset of data for manual annotation as a strategy for minimizing the annotation effort while maximizing the predictive performance of the model. Supervised learning was successfully used where clinical codes integrated with free-text notes into electronic health records were utilized as class labels. Similarly, distant supervision was used to utilize an existing knowledge base to automatically annotate raw text. Where manual annotation was unavoidable, crowdsourcing was explored, but it remains unsuitable because of the sensitive nature of data considered. Besides the small volume, training data were typically sourced from a small number of institutions, thus offering no hard evidence about the transferability of machine learning models. The majority of studies focused on text classification. Most commonly, the classification results were used to support phenotyping, prognosis, care improvement, resource management, and surveillance.Conclusions: We identified the data annotation bottleneck as one of the key obstacles to machine learning approaches in clinical NLP. Active learning and distant supervision were explored as a way of saving the annotation efforts. Future research in this field would benefit from alternatives such as data augmentation and transfer learning, or unsupervised learning, which do not require data annotation.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

This issue is due to the inherent problems of natural language such as ambiguity, impreciseness and incompleteness. In order to overcome these shortcomings, experts derive analysis models such as requirements models. However, these models are difficult and costly to create manually. Furthermore, the level of abstraction of the models is too low, thus hindering the automated transformation process. We propose a novel approach which uses high abstraction requirements models in the form of Object System Models (OSMs) as targets for the transformation of natural language specifications in conjunction with appropriate text mining and machine learning techniques. OSMs allow the interpretation of the textual specification based on a small set of facts and provide structural and behavioral information.

Considered variables are gender, age, time from diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, and smoking habit. Final models, tailored in accordance with the complications, provided an accuracy up to 0.838. Different variables were selected for each complication and time scenario, leading to specialized models easy to translate to the clinical practice.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

The most successful have made use of modern deep learning methods, in particular convolutional neural nets. However, such methods only provide a single scalar classification for each galaxy, which fails to account for the varying difficulty of each image. I will present the result of a novel application of a Bayesian convolutional neural network to provide predictions with uncertainty. Measuring uncertainty facilitates understanding the performance of the network and how it might be improved, but more importantly allows us to select the most informative images for citizen scientist classification. This in turn allows the development and deployment of a hybrid system which classifies new surveys more accurately than either humans or machines alone. We will present the performance of such a system with images from DeCALS, and explore how it allows us to scale citizen science classification while still retaining the potential for serendipitous discoveries of unexpected objects such as the Galaxy Zoo 'Peas'. ...","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"
"Machine Learning Applied to GRBAS Voice Quality Assessment","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/machine-learning-applied-to-grbas-voice-quality-assessment","Xie, Z.; Gadepalli, C.; Jalali, F.; Cheetham, B.; Homer, J.","1 Dec 2018","Voice problems are routinely assessed in hospital voice clinics by speech and language therapists (SLTs) who are highly skilled in making audio-perceptual evaluations of voice quality. The evaluations are often presented numerically in the form of five-dimensional ‘GRBAS’ scores. Computerised voice quality assessment may be carried out using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques which process recorded segments of a patient’s voice to measure certain acoustic features such as periodicity, jitter and shimmer. However, these acoustic features are often not obviously related to GRBAS scores that are widely recognised and understood by clinicians. This paper investigates the use of machine learning (ML) for mapping acoustic feature measurements to more familiar GRBAS scores. The training of the ML algorithms requires accurate and reliable GRBAS assessments of a representative set of voice recordings, together with corresponding acoustic feature measurements. Such ‘reference’ GRBAS assessments were obtained in this work by engaging a number of highly trained SLTs as raters to independently score each voice recording. Clearly, the consistency of the scoring is of interest, and it is possible to measure this consistency and take it into account when computing the reference scores, thus increasing their accuracy and reliability. The properties of well known techniques for the measurement of consistency, such as intra-class correlation (ICC) and the Cohen and Fleiss Kappas, are studied and compared for the purposes of this paper. Two basic ML techniques, i.e. K-nearest neighbour regression and multiple linear regression were evaluated for producing the required GRBAS scores by computer. Both were found to produce reasonable accuracy according to a repeated cross-validation test.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"
"Hybrid extreme learning machine approach for heterogeneous neural networks","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/hybrid-extreme-learning-machine-approach-for-heterogeneous-neural","Christou, V.; Tsipouras, M. G.; Giannakeas, N.; Tzallas, A. T.; Brown, G.","7 Oct 2019","In this paper, a hybrid learning approach, which combines the extreme learning machine (ELM) with a genetic algorithm (GA), is proposed. The utilization of this hybrid algorithm enables the creation of heterogeneous single layer neural networks (SLNNs) with better generalization ability than traditional ELM in terms of lower mean square error (MSE) for regression problems or higher accuracy for classification problems. The architecture of this method is not limited to traditional linear neurons, where each input participates equally to the neuron's activation, but is extended to support higher order neurons which affect the network's generalization ability. Initially, the proposed heterogeneous hybrid extreme learning machine (He-HyELM) algorithm creates a number of custom created neurons with different structure, which are used for the creation of homogeneous SLNNs. These networks are trained with ELM and an application specific GA evolves them into heterogeneous networks according to a fitness criterion utilizing the uniform crossover operator for the recombination process. After the completion of the evolution process, the network with the best fitness is selected as the most optimal. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning algorithm can get better results than traditional ELM, homogeneous hybrid extreme learning machine (Ho-HyELM) and optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM) for homogeneous and heterogeneous SLNNs.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

However, this technique retains a high barrier to entry. In particular, configuring image processing parameters for optimal cell profiling is susceptible to cognitive biases, and dependent on user experience. Here, we present an interactive machine learning strategy that learns the optimum cell profiling configuration to maximise quality of the cell profiling outcome. The process is guided by the user, from whom a rating of the quality of a cell profiling configuration is obtained. The machine learning algorithm uses this information to automatically recommend the next configuration to examine. We validated our interactive approach against the standard human trial-and-error scheme to optimise an object segmentation task on the standard software CellProfiler. Our approach enabled rapid optimisation of an object segmentation pipeline, which more accurately segmented objects compared to those optimsed through human trial-and-error. Users also attested to the ease of use and reduced cognitive load enabled by our machine learning strategy over the standard approach. We envision that our interactive machine learning strategy can enhance the quality and efficiency of pipeline optimisation to democratise image-based cell profiling.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

We applied supervised machine learning to the problem of using phenotype data to predict the functional class of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in Saccaromyces cerevisiae. Three sources of data were used: TRansposon-Insertion Phenotypes, Localization and Expression in Saccharomyces (TRIPLES), European Functional Analysis Network (EUROFAN) and Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS). The analysis of the data presented a number of challenges to machine learning: multi-class labels, a large number of sparsely populated classes, the need to learn a set of accurate rules (not a complete classification), and a very large amount of missing values. We modified the algorithm C4.5 to deal with these problems. Results: Rules were learnt which are accurate and biologically meaningful. The rules predict function of 83 ORFs of unknown function at an estimated accuracy of ≥80%.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

This work investigates snow coverage mapping by learning from Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral images via machine-learning methods. To this end, the largest dataset for snow coverage mapping (to our best knowledge) with three typical classes (snow, cloud and background) is first collected and labeled via the semi-automatic classification plugin in QGIS. Then, both random forest-based conventional machine learning and U-Net-based deep learning are applied to the semantic segmentation challenge in this work. The effects of various input band combinations are also investigated so that the most suitable one can be identified. Experimental results show that (1) both conventional machine-learning and advanced deep-learning methods significantly outperform the existing rule-based Sen2Cor product for snow mapping; (2) U-Net generally outperforms the random forest since both spectral and spatial information is incorporated in U-Net via convolution operations; (3) the best spectral band combination for U-Net is B2, B11, B4 and B9. It is concluded that a U-Net-based deep-learning classifier with four informative spectral bands is suitable for snow coverage mapping.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Survey breakoffs occur when respondents quit the survey partway through. The Cox survival model is commonly used to understand patterns of breakoffs. Nevertheless, there is a trend to using more data-driven models when the purpose is prediction, such as classification machine learning models. It is unclear in the breakoff literature what are the best statistical models for predicting question-level breakoffs. Additionally, there is no consensus about the treatment of time-varying question-level predictors, such as question response time and question word count. While some researchers use the current values, others aggregate the value from the beginning of the survey. This study develops and compares both survival models and classification models along with different treatments of time-varying variables. Based on the level of agreement between the predicted and actual breakoff, we find that the Cox model and gradient boosting outperform other survival models and classification models respectively. We also find that using the values of time-varying predictors concurrent to the breakoff status is more predictive of breakoff, compared to aggregating their values from the beginning of the survey, implying that respondents’ breakoff behaviour is more driven by the current response burden.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Past research has favored explanatory modeling, considering it a prediction-oriented approach; until recently, predictive analytics has been poorly understood and widely underappreciated. Research on IS for prediction-oriented modeling like predictive analytics remains rare, despite its potential for development and utility. Our research addresses the capacity of predictive analytics for advancing technology acceptance modeling by assessing predictive power, evaluating the current frameworks, and introducing new constructs. This research formulates a unique data-driven approach that utilizes machine learning (ML) and predictive analytics-based modeling to empirically predict end users’ acceptance of consumer-use technology in a non-organizational setting using the following steps. First, a thorough analysis of IS literature was conducted to explore the constructs of technology use in various contexts. Second, the Twitter API and interviews were utilized to extract new constructs and evaluate the content of current models of technology acceptance. Third, a unique technology acceptance model of thirty-seven constructs was developed and tested on thirty-two personal technologies with heterogeneous subjects. Fourth, ML algorithms estimated the predictive power of the model and ranked the influence of its variables, achieving an R
              2 of 0.97 and an error rate of 0.04. Thirteen new constructs were successfully introduced, including eight technology characteristics. Four other constructs were reinstated, presenting the utility of the ML approach to contribute to research. Ranking the thirty-seven constructs by applying a sensitivity analysis on the basis of partial derivatives showed the differences between the predictive model and the explanatory model of personal technology acceptance. The proposed approach demonstrates the capacity of ML to formulate a complex model of personal technology acceptance, which further develops technology acceptance models.

As such, they are targeted by attackers to impact their decisions. Text created by machine learning algorithms has many types of applications, some of which can be considered malicious especially if there is an intention to present machine-generated text as human-generated. In this paper, we surveyed major subjects in adversarial machine learning for text processing applications. Unlike adversarial machine learning in images, text problems and applications are heterogeneous. Thus, each problem can have its own challenges. We focused on some of the evolving research areas such as: malicious versus genuine text generation metrics, defense against adversarial attacks, and text generation models and algorithms. Our study showed that as applications of text generation will continue to grow in the near future, the type and nature of attacks on those applications and their machine learning algorithms will continue to grow as well. Literature survey indicated an increasing trend in using pre-trained models in machine learning. Word/sentence embedding models and transformers are examples of those pre-trained models. Adversarial models may utilize same or similar pre-trained models as well. In another trend related to text generation models, literature showed effort to develop universal text perturbations to be used in both black-and white-box attack settings. Literature showed also using conditional GANs to create latent representation for writing types. This usage will allow for a seamless lexical and grammatical transition between various writing styles. In text generation metrics, research trends showed developing successful automated or semi-automated assessment metrics that may include human judgement. Literature showed also research trends of designing and developing new memory models that increase performance and memory utilization efficiency without validating real-time constraints. Many research efforts evaluate different defense model approaches and algorithms. Researchers evaluated different types of targeted attacks, and methods to distinguish human versus machine generated text.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

E.","1992","Many attempts have been made to solve the problem of predicting protein secondary structure from the primary sequence but the best performance results are still disappointing. In this paper, the use of a machine learning algorithm which allows relational descriptions is shown to lead to improved performance. The Inductive Logic Programming computer program, Golem, was applied to learning secondary structure prediction rules for α/α domain type proteins. The input to the program consisted of 12 non-homologous proteins (1612 residues) of known structure, together with a background knowledge describing the chemical and physical properties of the residues. Golem learned a small set of rules that predict which residues are part of the α-helices—based on their positional relationships and chemical and physical properties. The rules were tested on four independent non-homologous proteins (416 residues) giving an accuracy of 81% (±2%). This is an improvement, on identical data, over the previously reported result of 73% by King and Sternberg (1990, J. Mol. Biol., 216, 441–457) using the machine learning program PROMIS, and of 72% using the standard Gamier-Osguthorpe-Robson method.

Based on the published algorithm to estimate the three lengths of the particles from the image pairs (method 1), the average error on the shortest length is around 140% on a test set of particles with different sizes, shapes, and alignment. Therefore, two potential improvements are tested in a simulation setting. The first approach uses an additional projection coupled with an oriented bounding box to estimate the three lengths (method 2). The second approach uses a machine learning model to estimate the three lengths from two projections (method 3). It is shown that method 2 marginally increases the accuracy, while method 3 leads to a significant improvement with an average error of 33% for the shortest characteristic length of particles in the test set and even less for the other lengths. It is shown that this remaining error is caused by the particle alignment with respect to the cameras. Since platelets cannot always be automatically distinguished from quasi-equant particles due to alignment issues, the model was also trained to estimate the three characteristic lengths of quasi-equant particles. The training set and the test set, used for model training and validation, respectively, comprise particles that exhibit quasi-equant, needlelike, and platelike shapes. Several machine learning models are identified and optimized to predict the three particle lengths based on the two projections from the imaging device. Artificial neural networks were chosen because of their superior predictive performance.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Solutions based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) have been presented to manage cloud infrastructure, however, these tend to be centralized and suffer in their ability to maintain Quality of Service (QoS) for data centres with thousands of nodes. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning management policy, which can run decentralized, and achieve fast convergence towards efficient resource allocation, resulting in lower SLA violations compared to centralized architectures. To address some of the common challenges in applying RL to cloud resource management, such as slow learning and state/action management, we use parallel learning and reduction of the state/action space. We apply a decision making approach to optimize the migration of a VM and choose a target node to host the VM in such a way that brings response time within SLA level. We have also demonstrate unique, multi-level reinforcement learning cooperation, that further reduces SLA violations.

High dimensional data with a small number of samples is of critical importance for identifying biomarkers and conducting feasibility and pilot work, however it can lead to biased machine learning (ML) performance estimates. Our review of studies which have applied ML to predict autistic from non-autistic individuals showed that small sample size is associated with higher reported classification accuracy. Thus, we have investigated whether this bias could be caused by the use of validation methods which do not sufficiently control overfitting. Our simulations show that K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) produces strongly biased performance estimates with small sample sizes, and the bias is still evident with sample size of 1000. Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data. The results suggest how to design robust testing methodologies when working with small datasets and how to interpret the results of other studies based on what validation method was used.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Finding suggests hybrid models provide useful tools for PM 2.5 concentration forecasting. The developed models show that machine learning models are efficient in predicting air particulate and can be used for air pollution forecasting. The study also provides insights into how the climatic factors influences the volume of pollutants found in the air.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"
"A novel approach to studying strategic decisions with eye-tracking and machine learning","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/a-novel-approach-to-studying-strategic-decisions-with-eye-trackin","Krol, M.; Król, M. E.","30 Nov 2017","We propose a novel method of using eye-tracking to study strategic decisions. The conventional approach is to hypothesize what eye-patterns should be observed if a given model of decision-making was accurate, and then proceed to verify if this occurs. When such hypothesis specification is difficult a priori, we propose instead to expose subjects to a variant of the original strategic task that should induce processing it in a way consistent with the postulated model. It is then possible to use machine learning pattern recognition techniques to check if the associated eye-patterns are similar to those recorded during the original task. We illustrate the method using simple examples of 2x2 matching-pennies and coordination games with or without feedback about the counterparts’ past moves. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the method in this context.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

The aim of this study is the spatial prediction of landslide using hybrid machine learning models including bagging (BA), random subspace (RS) and rotation forest (RF) with alternating decision tree (ADTree) as base classifier in the northern part of the Pithoragarh district, Uttarakhand, Himalaya, India. To construct the database, ten conditioning factors and a total of 103 landslide locations with a ratio of 70/30 were used. The significant factors were determined by chi-square attribute evaluation (CSEA) technique. The validity of the hybrid models was assessed by true positive rate (TP Rate), false positive rate (FP Rate), recall (sensitivity), precision, F-measure and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). Results concluded that land cover was the most important factor while curvature had no effect on landslide occurrence in the study area and it was removed from the modelling process. Additionally, results indicated that although all ensemble models enhanced the power prediction of the ADTree classifier (AUCtraining = 0.859; AUCvalidation = 0.813); however, the RS ensemble model (AUCtraining = 0.883; AUCvalidation = 0.842) outperformed and outclassed the RF (AUCtraining = 0.871; AUCvalidation = 0.840), and the BA (AUCtraining = 0.865; AUCvalidation = 0.836) ensemble model. The obtained results would be helpful for recognizing the landslide prone areas in future to better manage and decrease the damage and negative impacts on the environment.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

A more holistic road asset management approach enhanced by data-informed decision making through effective condition assessment, distress detection, future condition predictions can significantly enhance maintenance planning, prolonging asset life. Recent technology innovations such as Digital Twins have great potentials to enable the needed approach for road condition predictions and a proactive asset management. To this end, machine learning techniques have also demonstrated convincing capabilities in solving engineering problems. However, none of them has been considered specifically within digital twins context. There is therefore a need to review and identify appropriate approaches for the usage of machine learning techniques within road digital twins.This paper provides a systematic literature review of machine learning algorithms used for road condition predictions and discusses findings within the road digital twin framework. The results show that existing machine learning approaches are to some extent, suitable and mature to stipulate successful road digital twin development. Moreover, the review whilst identifying gaps in the literature, indicates several considerations and recommendations required on the journey to road digital twins, and suggests multiple future research directions based on the review summaries of machine learning capabilities.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

H.","Aug 2010","Metabolite fingerprinting of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants with known or predicted metabolic lesions was performed by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared, and flow injection electrospray-mass spectrometry. Fingerprinting enabled processing of five times more plants than conventional chromatographic profiling and was competitive for discriminating mutants, other than those affected in only low-abundance metabolites. Despite their rapidity and complexity, fingerprints yielded metabolomic insights (e.g. that effects of single lesions were usually not confined to individual pathways). Among fingerprint techniques, 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance discriminated the most mutant phenotypes from the wild type and Fourier transform infrared discriminated the fewest. To maximize information from fingerprints, data analysis was crucial. One-third of distinctive phenotypes might have been overlooked had data models been confined to principal component analysis score plots. Among several methods tested, machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely support vector machine or random forest (RF) classifiers, were unsurpassed for phenotype discrimination. Support vector machines were often the best performing classifiers, but RFs yielded some particularly informative measures. First, RFs estimated margins between mutant phenotypes, whose relations could then be visualized by Sammon mapping or hierarchical clustering. Second, RFs provided importance scores for the features within fingerprints that discriminated mutants. These scores correlated with analysis of variance F values (as did Kruskal-Wallis tests, true and false-positive measures, mutual information, and the Relief feature selection algorithm). ML classifiers, as models trained on one data set to predict another, were ideal for focused metabolomic queries, such as the distinctiveness and consistency of mutant phenotypes.

Identifying all the essential genes of an animal species can reveal critical functions that are needed during the development of the organism.  To inform studies of mouse development, we developed a supervised machine learning classifier based on phenotype data from mouse knockout experiments. We used this classifier to predict the essentiality of mouse genes lacking experimental data. Validation of our predictions against a blind test set of recent mouse knockout experimental data indicates a high level of accuracy (>80%). We also validated our predictions for other mouse mutagenesis methodologies, demonstrating that the predictions are accurate for lethal phenotypes isolated in random chemical mutagenesis screens and embryonic stem cell screens. The biological functions that are enriched in essential and non-essential genes have been identified, showing that essential genes tend to encode intracellular proteins that interact with nucleic acids. The genome distribution of predicted essential and non-essential genes was analysed, demonstrating that the density of essential genes varies throughout the genome.  A comparison with human essential and non-essential genes was performed, revealing conservation between human and mouse gene essentiality status. Our genome-wide predictions of mouse essential genes will be of value for the planning of mouse knockout experiments and phenotyping assays, for understanding the functional processes required during mouse development, and for the prioritisation of disease candidate genes identified in human genome and exome sequence datasets.

The absorbing screen consists of Hilbert curve metal strip array and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) graphene sheet. The graphene based screen is not only tunable when the chemical potential of the graphene changes, but also has broadband effective absorption. The absorption bandwidth is from 8.9GHz to 18.1GHz, ie., relative bandwidth of more than 68%, at chemical potential of 0eV, which is significantly wider than that if the graphene sheet had not been employed. As the chemical potential varies from 0 to 0.4eV, the central frequency of the screen can be tuned from 13.5GHz to 19.0GHz. In the proposed structure, Hilbert curve metal strip array was designed to provide multiple narrow band resonances, whereas the graphene sheet directly underneath the metal strip array provides tunability and averagely required surface resistance so to significantly extend the screen operation bandwidth by providing broadband impedance matching and absorption. In addition, the thickness of the screen has been optimized to achieve nearly the minimum thickness limitation for a nonmagnetic absorber. The working principle of this absorbing screen is studied in details, and performance under various incident angles is presented. This work extends applications of graphene into tunable microwave radar cross section (RCS) reduction applications.","Radar","University of Manchester"

It is found that turbulent dissipation rates in excess of 0.2 mW kg-1 may be detected using the spectral width, but uncertainties in the derivation of this parameter preclude detection of weak turbulence. Anisotropy of the signal is capable of detecting some turbulence in regions of high static stability, but the method is not quantitative and is best employed to confirm the spectral-width estimates when these are near the detection limit. Independent confirmation that atmospheric conditions were favourable for turbulence was provided by Richardson number profiles derived from the radar and a Raman lidar. Measurements of static stability by the lidar and spectral widths by the radar allow an estimate of the turbulent-dissipation rate. The application of these techniques to two jet stream passages is discussed.","Radar","University of Manchester"

Severe  wildfires  damage  peatlands,  removing vegetation and  burning  peat,  often  leaving  the  area  in  a  degraded  state.  Monitoring  burn  scar  location  and 
persistence is important for targeting restoration works, but mostly relies on ground surveying, with mapping  using  optical  satellite  imagery  limited  by  cloud  cover  in  the  UK  (Armitage  et  al.,  2007).

W.","1 Oct 2020","In this study, a dual-functional radar and communication (RadCom) system architecture is proposed for application at base-stations (BSs), or access points (APs), for simultaneously communicating with multiple user equipments (UEs) and sensing the environment. Specifically, massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) communication and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based MIMO radar are considered with the objective to jointly utilize channel diversity and interference. The BS consists of a mMIMO antenna array, and radar transmit and receive antennas. Employing OFDM waveforms for the radar allows the BS to perform channel state information (CSI) estimation  for the mMIMO and radar antennas simultaneously. The acquired CSI is then exploited to predict the radar signals received by the UEs. While the radar transmits an OFDM waveform for  detecting possible targets in range, the communication system beamforms to the UEs taking into account the predicted radar interference. To further enhance the capacity of the communication system, an optimum radar waveform is designed. Moreover, the network capacity is mathematically analyzed and verified by simulations. The results show that the proposed RadCom can achieve higher capacity than conventional mMIMO systems by utilizing the radar interference while simultaneously detecting targets.","Radar","University of Manchester"

M.","Oct 2007","We present an analysis of eight years' data from the UK MST radar at Aberystwyth, Wales, to determine the occurrence and properties of long-period, quasi-monochromatic oscillations in the wind vector identified with inertia-gravity waves. Wave perturbations were first isolated by filtering out background wind variation in the vertical, then the continuity of the radar measurements was exploited to apply band-pass filters in time to select quasi-monochromatic oscillations with periods 4-8 hours or 12-24 hours. By searching for altitude regions where the wind vector rotates systematically with height, and fitting ellipses to such sections, the properties of inertia-gravity waves can be derived. To guard against contamination by short-intrinsic-period mountain waves, cases were discarded when the vertical velocity measured by the radar exceeded 15 cm s-1. Results show that waves in the stratosphere are dominated by upward energy propagation (clockwise rotation) and those in the troposphere by downward propagation, consistent with the dominant source for inertia-gravity waves being at tropopause level. Long-period waves (> 12 hours) are observed 70% of the time in the lower stratosphere, roughly twice as often as the shorter-period waves, and 10-20% of the time in the troposphere. There is a winter maximum in occurrence in the troposphere and for the short-period stratospheric waves; however, the dominant long-period waves show little seasonal dependence. Likewise, they show only a weak correlation with jet-stream velocity or direction, unlike the other categories which are preferentially associated with strong jet streams and propagate along the jet. Inertia-gravity waves observed by the radar have typical amplitudes 1-2 m s-1 and vertical wavelength 2 km. The intrinsic wave period, estimated for non-jet-stream conditions, is similar for the two band-passed series, pointing to the importance of Doppler shifting in generating the observed oscillations.

M.","2000","The break-up of a stratospheric streamer over the British Isles is described, using satellite, Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere (MST) radar and in situ observations together with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses. The streamer started as a thin ribbon of high potential vorticity to the west of the British Isles. As this was strained by the background flow it broke up into a series of mesoscale vortices. MST radar and ozonesonde observations delineated a tropopause fold to the west of the initial streamer, taking the form of a thin layer of stratospheric air embedded in a deep layer of descending upper-tropospheric air. The fold appears to have been mixed out by small-scale turbulence as the streamer broke up. This break-up also generated strong inertia-gravity waves, which broke just above the tropopause introducing extensive mixing to the lowermost stratosphere. One of the mesoscale vortices returned over the MST radar, showing a very indistinct tropopause typical of a synoptic-scale cut-off low. This vortex was also responsible for the development of a rain band on its eastern flank, which brought significant rainfall to the British Isles at a time when the synoptic flow pattern was strongly anticyclonic.","Radar","University of Manchester"

J.","2013","Electromagnetic systems for imaging concealed objects at checkpoints typically employ radiation at millimetre and terahertz frequencies. These systems have been shown to be effective and provide a sufficiently high resolution image. However there are difficulties and current electromagnetic systems have limitations particularly in accurately differentiating between threat and innocuous objects based on shape, surface emissivity or reflectivity, which are indicative parameters. In addition, water has a high absorption coefficient at millimetre wavelength and terahertz frequencies, which makes it more difficult for these frequencies to image through thick damp clothing. This paper considers the potential of using ultra wideband (UWB) in the low gigahertz range. The application of this frequency band to security screening appears to be a relatively new field. The business case for implementing the UWB system has been made financially viable by the recent availability of low-cost integrated circuits operating at these frequencies. Although designed for the communication sector, these devices can perform the required UWB radar measurements as well. This paper reports the implementation of a 2 to 5 GHz bandwidth linear array scanner. The paper describes the design and fabrication of transmitter and receiver antenna arrays whose individual elements are a type of antipodal Vivaldi antenna. The antenna's frequency and angular response were simulated in CST Microwave Studio and compared with laboratory measurements. The data pre-processing methods of background subtraction and deconvolution are implemented to improve the image quality. The background subtraction method uses a reference dataset to remove antenna crosstalk and room reflections from the dataset. The deconvolution method uses a Wiener filter to sharpen the returned echoes which improves the resolution of the reconstructed image. The filter uses an impulse response reference dataset and a signal-to-noise parameter to determine how the frequencies contained in the echo dataset are normalised. The chosen image reconstruction algorithm is based on the back-projection method. The algorithm was implemented in MATLAB and uses a pre-calculated sensitivity matrix to increase the computation speed. The results include both 2D and 3D image datasets. The 3D datasets were obtained by scanning the dual sixteen element linear antenna array over the test object. The system has been tested on both humans and mannequin test objects. The front surface of an object placed on the human/mannequin torso is clearly visible, but its presence is also seen from a tell-tale imaging characteristic. This characteristic is caused by a reduction in the wave velocity as the electromagnetic radiation passes through the object, and manifests as an indentation in the reconstructed image that is readily identifiable. The prototype system has been shown to easily detect a 12 mm x 30 mm x70 mm plastic object concealed under clothing. © 2013 SPIE.","Radar","University of Manchester"

"Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging for Burn Wounds Diagnostics","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/synthetic-aperture-radar-imaging-for-burn-wounds-diagnostics","Owda, A. Y.; Owda, M.; Rezgui, N.","2020","The need for technologies to monitor the wound healing under dressing materials has led us to investigate the feasibility of using microwave and millimetre wave radiations due to their sensitivity to water, non- ionising nature, and transparency to dressing materials and clothing. This paper presents synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images obtained from an active microwave and millimetre wave scanner operating over the band 15–40 GHz. Experimental images obtained from porcine skin samples with the presence of dressing materials and after the application of localised heat treatments reveal that SAR images can be used for diagnosing burns and for potentially monitoring the healing under dressing materials. The experimental images were extracted separately from the amplitude and phase measurements of the input reflection coefficient (S11). The acquired images indicate that skin and burns can be detected and observed through dressing materials as well as features of the skin such as edges, irregularities, bends, burns, and variation in the reflectance of the skin. These unique findings enable a microwave and millimetre-wave scanner to be used for evaluating the wound healing progress under dressing materials without their often-painful removal: a capability that will reduce the cost of healthcare, distress caused by long waiting hours, and the healthcare interventional time.","Radar","University of Manchester"

The first factor is determined by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), whose nodes represent the blip's characteristics, including the velocity, direction and size. Additionally, the structure and conditional probability tables of the DAG can be learned from verified samples. Subsequently, obstacles in a waterway can be described as collision potential fields using an Artificial Potential Field model, and the corresponding coefficients can be trained in accordance with the historical vessel distribution. Then, the other factor, the positional collision potential of any position is obtained through overlapping all the collision potential fields. For simplicity, only static obstacles have been considered. Eventually, the two factors are characterised as evidence, and the collision probability of a blip is estimated by combining them with Dempster's rule. Through ranking blips on collision probabilities, those that pose high threat to safety can be picked up in advance to remind radar operators. Particularly, a good agreement between the proposed approach and the manual operation was found in a preliminary test.","Radar","University of Manchester"

We find that the echoes are greatest in air of moderate (30-70%) humidity, and least in very dry or near-saturated air. Compared to moderate humidities, the standard model for radar echoes, based on potential refractivity, overpredicts the echo power at high relative humidity by approximately 10 dB. We propose that this is due to the effect of precipitation in suppressing small-scale humidity gradients. A model which assumes complete suppression underpredicts the observed power drastically, showing that precipitation can only remove a part of the small-scale structure in refractivity which is caused by fluctuations in humidity.","Radar","University of Manchester"

It radiates radar pulses to probe the ground that contains a variety of media, including landmine, sand, soil, clay, water, etc. and a large number of clutter items like burrows, cracks, discarded waste, branches and roots, metal wire, and so on. The subsurface is in such a complex and unidentified condition, that it will impact the performance of the GPR system considerably. This brings a big challenge for the system developers to control and understand the GPR system, especially during the early stage of the design. Therefore, a simpler and less time-consuming simulation method for GPR than the real-field test is essential for engineers to have an overview and a clear grasp of the whole GPR system.

The characterization of morphology, chemical composition, magnetic and mechanical properties, including tensile strength, bending rigidity and friction, of the prepared ferromagnetic nickel micron-fiber is investigated. The results showed that compared with conventional radar absorbers, ferromagnetic nickel micron-fibers have many advantages in theirappearance and magnetic performance. The total ferromagnetic metal fraction of Ni and Fe was above 90%. Irregular cross-section and large aspect ratio of 3800 of the fiber enabled the magnetic hysteresis loss and absorbing performance to be increased obviously.

Particularly, an unequal-distance discretisation method is proposed to reduce the intervals of a blip's characteristics for avoiding the combinatorial explosion problem. Then, the undetermined DAG structure and parameters are learned from manually verified data samples.

The aircraft instrumentation included the Small Ice Detector (SID) and Nevzorov probe that are both capable of discriminating between liquid and ice phase. It was found that particle sphericity measured by the SID could be successfully used as a proxy for particle phase. Using a combination of the SID and other probes it is possible to determine whether a 100 m cloud segment is ice, liquid or mixed-phase. Regions as short as 100 m exhibited mixed-phase characteristics. There was generally good agreement between water phase indicated by the SID and Nevzorov probes, with any differences arising from the fact that the SID provides a number-weighted estimate of dominant phase, while the Nevzorov probe provides a mass-weighted estimate. The radar and aircraft observations show that when high values of differential reflectivity are observed the nearby presence of liquid water is indicated. When large ice crystals are present in deeper cloud they can suppress the differential reflectivity signal. Therefore the absence of a high differential reflectivity signal does not necessarily mean that liquid water is absent. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2004.","Radar","University of Manchester"

A total of 127 radiosondes provide an independent measure of winds. Differences between radiosonde and radar-measured horizontal winds are correlated with long-term averages of vertical velocities, suggesting an influence from local mountain waves. These local influences are an important consideration when using radar winds as a measure of regional conditions, particularly for numerical weather prediction. For those applications, local effects represent a source of sampling error additional to the inherent uncertainties in the measurements themselves. The radar renovation improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of measurements, with a corresponding improvement in altitude coverage. It also corrected an underestimate of horizontal wind speeds attributed to beam formation problems, due to pre-renovation component failure. The root mean square error (RMSE) in radar-measured horizontal wind components, averaged over half an hour, increases with wind speed and altitude, and is 0.8–2.5 m s−1 (6–12% of wind speed) for post-renovation winds. Pre-renovation values are typically 0.1 m s−1 larger. The RMSE in radial velocities is <0.04 m s−1. Eight weeks of special radar operation are used to investigate the effects of echo power aspect sensitivity. Corrections for echo power aspect sensitivity remove an underestimate of horizontal wind speeds; however aspect sensitivity is azimuthally anisotropic at the scale of routine observations (≈1 h). This anisotropy introduces random error into wind profiles. For winds averaged over half an hour, the RMSE is around 3.5% above 8 km, but as large as 4.5% in the mid-troposphere.","Radar","University of Manchester"

While some of the interviewees more or less approved of these practices as logical from the corporate perspective, and were confident that their jobs were too complex to be at risk, most are questioning these processes and some were actively trying to organize in an effort to halt or at least slow down such trends. How and why high-tech workers accommodate or resist management policies and practices they disagree with is analyzed with attention to the impact of ideology.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Oda Nobunaga was the first of three military leaders who all played leading roles in unifying Japan (the other two being Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu). For a long period of time, access to Banshōji was limited to members of Japan’s military and financial elites.As head priest Daitō Gen’yū explains in this video, only around twenty extended family households were affiliated as parishioners of Banshōji before he took office. His tenure marked the construction of “eternal memorial graves” (eitai kuyōbo), an innovative grave model that flourished in response to societal changes in Japan’s rapidly shrinking and aging society. This video introduces several of Banshōji’s indoor graves and shows how different graves represent different aesthetics, needs, and financial plans.

The results show that entrepreneurs learn strategically about business opportunities. Six learning strategies were identified as relevant to the process of opportunity identification. Prior knowledge of foreign markets was found as the most significant factor, while cognitive style was found to moderate the strength of the relationships between prior knowledge and the learning strategies. Entrepreneurs can benefit from these findings by recognising that they have a battery of learning strategies, which are relevant to the opportunity identification process. The identification of six learning strategies that are relevant to the process of opportunity identification is unique to this study.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Consistently with previous literature, the knowledge stock has a significant positive impact on a firm's productivity. More interestingly, the coefficient turns out to be significantly larger in the R&D-user services and high-tech manufacturing sectors than in the non-high-tech manufacturing sectors. Contrary to the ‘latecomer advantage’ approach, these outcomes suggest that firms in high-tech sectors are still ahead in terms of impact on productivity of R&D investments.","Tech","University of Manchester"

The empirical analysis is based on both the European sectoral OECD data and on a unique micro-longitudinal database consisting of 532 top European R&D investors. The main conclusions are as follows. First, the R&D stock has a significant positive impact on labor productivity; this general result is largely consistent with previous literature in terms of the sign, the significance, and the magnitude of the estimated coefficients. More interestingly, both at sectoral and firm levels the R&D coefficient increases monotonically (both in significance and magnitude) when we move from the low-tech to the medium- and high-tech sectors. This outcome means that corporate R&D investment is more effective in the high-tech sectors and this may need to be taken into account when designing policy instruments (subsidies, fiscal incentives, etc.) in support of private R&D. However, R&D investment is not the sole source of productivity gains; technological change embodied in gross investment is of comparable importance on aggregate and is the main determinant of productivity increase in the low-tech sectors. Hence, an economic policy aiming to increase productivity in the low-tech sectors should support overall capital formation.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Far from business-as-usual, we explain how Big Tech is reshaping the traditional automotive industry by making the car “platform ready,” as imposed on the web before it. The article considers how this novel transformation of automobility is increasingly significant for critical scholars of social media, platforms, and platformization, as bespoke forms of mediated, datafied, and platformized, sociality emerge. Specifically, we identify six levels upon which this platformization of automobility is unfolding and through which Big Tech is reorganizing the automotive industry according to platform logics concerning programmability, modularity, connectivity, data collection, and developmental partnerships. We do so by analyzing academic and technical literature, industry reports, and initiatives with a stake in platform automobility. Finally, we suggest directions for further research into Big Tech’s stake in the future of automobility, as these new dynamics begin to reshape the automotive industry at large.","Tech","University of Manchester"

The recent trend of further fine slicing within the chains and fragmentation of production has become possible partly due to the changes in trade and investment regulation. However, Intellectual Property (IP) has played a crucial role in those changes, especially in a high-tech sector that has been driven mainly by the interests of Multinational Enterprises (MNEs). As of today, one of the biggest challenges has been to regulate IPRs in the cases of 1st and 2nd tier suppliers plugged into transnational chains.The paper aims to address the existing asymmetry in literature and provide a legal analysis of the IPRs in their relevance to high-tech GVCs/GPNs. The specific choice of an inter-disciplinary approach has been made to ensure a comprehensive all-rounded legal evaluation of IP in the context of high-tech chains, which so far have been mainly the subject of an economic and developmental agenda. In particular, patents, utility models, technological processes, know-how and technology transfer will be evaluated in their scope and application under Indian, Japanese and EU legislation with the emphasis on the comparative assessment of relevant case law. It will further enable establishing links between IPRs functioning on a national level and international regime via TRIPs. The paper will also cover the challenges of compulsory licensing in India and its potential impact on IPRs.Overall, the paper will benefit PhD students and legal scholars specialising in IP and technology transfer as well as professionals researching on GVCs/GPNs and IP. It will also be beneficial to a wider audience.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Codification and (de-)skilling in automotive components value chains","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/whither-high-tech-labor-codification-and-de-skilling-in-automotiv","Machacek, E.; Hess, M.","7 Feb 2019","This paper seeks to address the limits of the global value chain (GVC) framework for explaining processes of deskilling in the changing international division of labor, outsourcing and offshoring. In the GVC framework, deskilling is insufficiently addressed in the context of social upgrading which usually focuses on measureable labor standards and enabling rights. Using a case study of component manufacturing in the automotive sector, this study shows that a critical understanding of the codification process is key for identifying how deskilling occurs within international divisions of labor in a high-tech industry. The paper draws on Michael Polanyi’s conceptualization of tacit knowledge and Harry Braverman’s work on labor and monopoly capital to refine and frame the role of codification in GVC governance structures. Currently, explanations of the ability to codify knowledge center on a technical and, at most, implicit experiential dimension of tacit knowledge (the know-how acquired through experience), and thus only on one of two constituents of Polanyi’s conceptualization. Yet the cognitive dimension, which relies on the articulation and sharing of experiences, imitation, performance and other forms of knowledge exchange among workers, is largely absent. This is detrimental to explaining the complex processes of deskilling within GVCs. Empirically, our argument is illustrated by analyzing intra-firm decisions on codifying information for the manufacturing of automotive magnet components in Europe and in the magnet industry hub of Ningbo, China. Specifically, we discuss how these decisions liberate some workers in some places for skill upgrading (upskilling), but are clearly limiting many others to perform routine tasks removed from any innovative collaboration, i.e. (relative) deskilling. The paper finds an international division of labor facilitated and maintained to no small extent by intra-firm decision-making on knowledge codification, with mixed results for skills upgrading and (relative) deskilling.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Design buffers involve building slack into a proven systems architecture to absorb foreseeable change requests. Choosing the appropriate amounts of reuse and slack is dependent on the uncertainty in the manufacturing technology over the infrastructure life cycle. While proven infrastructure designs can economically accommodate incremental changes in technology, adaptation costs escalate when sufficient buffers are not built-in and changes are radical. We uncover opposing stakeholder interests in determining the extent to which reuse or buffers are used. Design reuse is attractive to the client to reduce the risk that a facility fails to perform, but limits the designer's job to tedious customization work. Design buffers are attractive to the designer to do original problem-solving and limit the risks of being unresponsive to uncertainty, but not to the client who is not guaranteed that the investments will pay off. We find that inequalities between the two stakeholders in the governing power on design decision-making compound the difficulties in assessing and implementing the reuse versus buffers tradeoff. © 2007 IEEE.","Tech","University of Manchester"

A.; Blome, C.; Papadopoulos, T.","15 May 2019","The scarcity of IT resources and technological advancements in high-tech small and medium enterprises (SMEs) require leaders to embed IT ambidexterity – simultaneous pursuit of IT exploitation and IT exploration activities – into their organization’s strategy, which could be challenging. To better understand how leaders enable IT ambidexterity, this study focuses on the leadership decision-making style (directive decision-making and participative decision-making) as a key driving factor. Moreover, we examine how and when leadership decision-making styles are most effective in enacting IT ambidexterity by considering new product development (NPD) team diversity and shared vision as two important contingencies. Finally, we test the role of IT ambidexterity in improving NPD performance. We analyse our research model using survey data from 292 high-tech SMEs. Our findings suggest that both decision-making styles enable IT ambidexterity, however, participative decision-making style is more effective in highly diverse NPD teams and directive decision-making style should be preferred when shared vision is a dominant factor among NPD team members. Our results also show that IT ambidexterity significantly enhances NPD performance. We discuss our contribution to information systems (IS) and ambidexterity research and provide implications for practice.","Tech","University of Manchester"

This paper outlines the concept of the MFP, looks at the environmental issues which the MFP raises for creating sustainable urban development, and seeks to identify some of the challenges to urban planning and urban governance raised by the MFP. In this respect, some interesting tensions have arisen between the different strands of the MFP debate, where commercial viability and political credibility have become a central issue for investors, whilst environmental issues have emerged as a pivotal theme in gaining community acceptance of the MFP proposal. -from Author","Tech","University of Manchester"

Despite the Italian industrial system being only marginally present in the Japanese market, in comparison to other European countries, interesting interaction dynamics are detectable between Japanese and Italian industrial companies active in medium and high-tech technology sectors. By adopting the Uppsala Model for internationalization and the IMP Group relationship marketing perspective approach, four case studies of Italian companies who successfully invested in Japan are addressed. The companies are analyzed with respect to their entry strategies and to their progressive commitment into the Japanese market, following a stage-based approach aiming at further strengthening their credibility. The common aspects in the process of Italian firms approaching the market are passed in review and properly discussed in the last section of the paper, together with difficulties and peculiarities characterizing the integration of foreign companies in the local supply chains. Moreover, the role of Japan as a “learing market” for the investing firms is considered, especially in terms of acquired competitive advantages and potential gains to be exploited also in other attractable markets for their business.","Tech","University of Manchester"

The traditional internationalization theories suggest that the firm's international involvement increases in stages as a result of incremental learning. However, the small information and communications technology (ICT) companies are often characterized as born globals, showing very rapid and intensive international growth enabled by the use of external resources, such as partnerships and networks. Adopting a knowledge-based view of the firm has proved to be a useful way to theoretically explain the internationalization process of these ICT SMEs. However, in our view, the crucial dynamic aspects of knowledge development have not received enough attention in previous empirical studies, which have typically been more like static snapshots. In this paper, we will first launch an evolutionary knowledge management model, derive then its basic theoretical propositions and finally test them empirically in terms of a longitudinal survey of small- and medium-sized software and content providers in the Finnish ICT-sector (from the year 1999 to 2001). Most of the results are straightforward and show that at least some of the proposed knowledge-related determinants really have significant effects on the dynamics of internationalization.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Based on a survey of active users of mobile telecommunications services in Taiwan, we obtained the following findings. First, we found that empathy, network quality, reliability, and assurance, but not tangibles and responsiveness, have a significant effect on service quality and value perception. Second, the effect of overall service quality on brand equity is partially mediated by perceived value. Third, overall service quality has differential mediation effects on the relationships between specific service quality dimensions and perceived value. Finally, empathy and network quality have direct effects on brand equity. For managers, our study suggests the importance of identifying key service drivers for building strong service brand for high-tech service firms. The identification of key service drivers could then enable these firms to make strategic decisions on services investments. It also demonstrates the importance of the humanisation of technology for services firms.

The techniques used are categorized according to their effect and the principal findings are summarized. The majority of participants preferred enhanced images over the original for a wide range of enhancement types. Adapting the contrast and spatial frequency content often improved performance at object recognition and reading speed, as did techniques that attenuate the image background and a technique that induced jitter. A lack of consistency in preference and performance measures was found, as well as a lack of independent studies.

M. C.; Aldred, M. L.","Jun 2011","Purpose: This paper aims to assess the extent to which convergence in institutional regimes is likely to occur, by examining all ten new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe in terms of their development of comparative advantages in high-tech export markets either by drawing on foreign investors in the form of multinational companies or by making use of domestic institutional resources. Design/methodology/approach: The article uses fuzzy sets and qualitative comparative analysis to examine both necessary and sufficient causes of success in high-tech export markets. By doing so, it can address the important issue of institutional complementarity. Findings: While it finds that countries that have stronger records in such markets share common features, there are also important differences between them - not least in the areas of employee relations. This, together with other evidence presented in the paper, suggests that convergence around a specific institutional model is unlikely to happen. Originality/value: Analysing, unlike many previous studies, all ten new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe enables conclusions to be drawn that apply to the whole region. The novel method used in this article means that the extent of any complementarity between different institutions can be addressed, and ensures that issues relating to convergence/divergence are explored. The article, therefore, contributes to a number of important debates on the convergence among types of capitalism, the dependency of the new EU member states on foreign investors, and the institutional foundations for success in high-tech export markets. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Tech","University of Manchester"

"Entering the Asian developmental state in high-tech and service industries: the case of Italian SMEs in China and Japan","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/entering-the-asian-developmental-state-in-high-tech-and-service-i","Corsi, S.","Jul 2010","From an industrial policy point of view, Japan and China show similar attitudes towards a progressive opening of their market economies even though they pursuit it in different periods. The two countries share also a good economic planning run by an effective bureaucracy. Japanese industrial system has always been regarded as a state controlled relationship network amongst firms (Gerlach, 1992; Lincoln et al, 1992). During the '80s and '90s, these particular features and business practices have been described as one of the main sources of competitive advantage for the Japanese manufacturing system (Imai, 1986; Lincoln et al, 1996, Lincoln et al , 1998).On the other side foreign manufacturing firms have looked at the Chinese industrial system as a low cost one and they therefore delocalize there consistent parts of their activities. Nowadays mostly foreign service and high-tech firms  look at China as a competitive and important market both for selling and for product development (Child, Tse, 2001). In both cases foreign firms face difficulties both in entry processes and in establishing regular and profitable activities because of cultural distance, different institutions, scarce resources, and so on. From a micro perspective the two investigated countries show similarities in typical business practices (Hofstede, 1980). In particular they seem to share a strong attitude towards long-term business relationships (Dyer et al, 2001; Leung et al, 2005). These relations shape the markets in interconnected business networks and allow to overcome traditional and pure market mechanisms. Moreover long-term relationships help innovation processes in terms of flexibility and knowledge sharing as well as time-to-market and cost reduction (Herbig et al, 1996).We use case study research to collect data on Italian service and high-tech small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that operate in China and Japan and we try to understand if a competitive advantage can be earned from local business practices and if it can be replicated in the country of origin. This study represents a first effort aimed at refining the research questions above and it will be used to focus our ongoing research in a more focused direction. Our current data suggest that, despite major changes in the investigated systems have occurred during the last years, SMEs can still earn a competitive advantage on the Chinese and Japanese markets from such local business practices. However our focal firms seem to face difficulties replying these advantages in their country of origin because of cultural distance and differences in industrial systems organization.","Tech","University of Manchester"

H.; Ding, Z.","Mar 2008","This brief paper continues a development in earlier publications by Rosenbrock, in which results in quantum mechanics were obtained by adding a random disturbance to Hamilton's principle. The disturbance is complex, and the resulting variational problem is solved by dynamic programming, which computes the causal relations needed to accomplish a purpose. It is shown here that this procedure leads to many results that agree with those obtained in the standard theory of quantum mechanics, but also to some that are not readily obtained in that theory. For example, certain changes at a time tm to the end condition xf, which will be reached at tftm, can instantaneously change some aspects of the particle's behaviour at t m while it is still in transit. This accounts for Einstein's 'spooky action at a distance'. An approach is also given to interference and entanglement, which is simpler than the standard account and may therefore be useful in quantum control and quantum computation. © 2008 The Institute of Measurement and Control.","Programming","University of Manchester"

We first exploit the duality between the linear optimal observer and the linear quadratic tracking (LQT) control. We show that the optimal observer design can be formulated as an optimal control problem subject to a specific cost function, and thus the solution can be obtained by solving an algebraic Riccati equation (ARE). For nonlinear systems, we further introduce an optimal observer design formulation and suggest a modified policy iteration method. Finally, to solve the problem online we propose a framework based on ADP and specifically on an approximator structure. Namely, a critic approximator is used to estimate the optimal value function, and a newly developed tuning law is proposed to find the parameters online. The stability and the performance are guaranteed with rigorous proofs. Numerical simulations are given to validate the theoretical studies.","Programming","University of Manchester"

Bounded Model Checking (BMC) is one method that can achieve decidability by searching for violations of properties of a program up to a bound k. BMC reduces the program verification problem to the classic NP-complete Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). However, it can still lead to an exponential state-space exploration due to the program’s large and possibly unbounded loops. In this case, there might be many execution paths to traverse through a program during its symbolic execution. Therefore, the control flow or computation during the program’s execution, mainly in symbolic execution, can be represented as a directed graph named Control Flow Graph (CFG). In this work, we present the properties of the CFG and discuss the application of constraint programming techniques to reduce variable domains as a preprocessing step or during the BMC process for verifying software systems. We also describe how constraint programming can be exploited to prove the (partial) correctness of the program via proof by induction built on top of BMC.","Programming","University of Manchester"

This is the first comprehensive approach to the verification of programs developed using programming languages based on the BDI (belief-desire-intention) model of agency. In particular, we have developed a specific layer of abstraction, sitting between the underlying verification system and the agent programming language, that maps the semantics of agent programs into the relevant model-checking framework. Crucially, this abstraction layer is both flexible and extensible; not only can a variety of different agent programming languages be implemented and verified, but even heterogeneous multi-agent programs can be captured semantically. In addition to describing this layer, and the semantic mapping inherent within it, we describe how the underlying model-checker is driven and how agent properties are checked. We also present several examples showing how the system can be used. As this is the first system of its kind, it is relatively slow, so we also indicate further work that needs to be tackled to improve performance.","Programming","University of Manchester"

However, the open-world semantics of OWL seems to be fundamentally incompatible with the closed-world semantics of LP. This has sparked a heated debate in the Semantic Web community, resulting in proposals for alternative ontology languages based entirely on logic programming. To help resolving this debate, we investigate the practical use cases which seem to be addressed by logic programming. In fact, many of these requirements have already been addressed outside the Semantic Web. By drawing inspiration from these existing formalisms, we present a novel logic of hybrid MKNF knowledge bases, which seamlessly integrates OWL with LP. We are thus capable of addressing the identified use cases without a radical change in the architecture of the Semantic Web. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","Programming","University of Manchester"

In the Inventory and Impact Assessment phases, in addition to calculating the environmental impacts and burdens, it can be used for solving the problem of allocation in multiple- output systems. In the Improvement Assessment phase, it provides a systematic approach to identifying possibilities for system improvements by optimising the system on different environmental objective functions, defined as burdens or impacts. Ultimately, if the environmental impacts are aggregated to a single environmental impact function in the Valuation phase, LP optimisation can identify the overall environmental optimum of the system. However, the aggregation of impacts is not necessary: the system can be optimised on different environmental burdens or impacts simultaneously by using Multiobjective LP. As a result, a range of environmental optima is found offering a number of alternative options for system improvements and enabling the choice of the Best Practicable Environmental Option (BPEO). If, in addition, economic and social criteria are introduced in the model, LP can be used to identify the best compromise solution in a system with conflicting objectives. This approach is illustrated by a real case study of the borate products system.","Programming","University of Manchester"

High level languages for bio-molecular systems aim to achieve a similar level of abstraction, so that a system might be de- signed on the basis of the behaviors that are desired, rather than the particulars of the genetic code that will be used to implement these behaviors. The drawback to this sort of high-level approach is that it generally means giving up control over some aspects of the system and having decreased efficiency relative to hand-tuned designs. Different languages make different tradeoffs in which aspects of design they em- phasize and which they automate, so we expect that for biology, there will be no single “right language,” just as there is not for electronic com- puting. Because synthetic biology is a new area, no mature languages have yet emerged. In this chapter, we present an in-depth survey of four representative languages currently in development—GenoCAD, Eugene, GEC, and Proto—as well as a brief overview of other related high-level design tools.","Programming","University of Manchester"

Restructuring algorithms in terms of simple linear algebra modules is reviewed. This technique has proved very succesful in obtaining a high level of transportability without severe loss of performance on a wide variety of both vector and parallel computers. The use of modules to encapsulate parallelism and reduce the ratio of data movement to floating-point operations has been demonstrably effective for regular problems such as those found in dense linear algebra. In other situations it may be necessary to express explicitly parallel algorithms. We also present a programming methodology that is useful for constructing new parallel algorithms which require sophisticated synchronization at a large grain level.

The objective in performing this adaptive grouping and allocation is to improve the quality of service (QoS) - in terms of bit error rate (BER) - seen by users in the system. Employing a simu lation study, we compare the results of the proposed linear programming algorithm with the results of other approaches from the literature. These results show that the proposed algorithm gives better QoS performance, for more users in the system, than previous approaches.","Programming","University of Manchester"

"Zames-Falb multipliers for quadratic programming","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/zames-falb-multipliers-for-quadratic-programming","Heath, W. P.; Wills, A. G.","Oct 2007","In constrained linear model predictive control, a quadratic program must be solved on-line at each control step, and this constitutes a nonlinearity. If zero is a feasible point for this quadratic program then the resultant nonlinearity is sector bounded. We show that if the nonlinearity is static then it is also monotone and slope restricted; hence, we show the existence of Zames-Falb multipliers for such a nonlinearity. The multipliers may be used in a general and versatile analysis of the robust stability of input constrained model predictive control. © 2007 IEEE.","Programming","University of Manchester"

"Separation Process Optimization under Uncertainty by Chance Constraint Programming with Recourse","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/separation-process-optimization-under-uncertainty-by-chance-const","Sun, L.; Zhang, H.","2015","In this paper, the methodology of chance constraints programming with resource is proposed for the separation process optimization under uncertainty. In this approach, uncertain factors are classified into two types: the first type of uncertainties is compensated for by introducing a penalty term to the optimization objective, and the other uncertainties are expressed by chance constraints at certain confidence levels in the optimization model. The solution strategy is developed by a sequence transform hybrid algorithm involving both Monte Carlo integration and improved Benders decomposition strategies with sequential quadratic programming. 1-hexene separation process is optimized as a case study to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed strategy.","Programming","University of Manchester"
"Multi-dimensional dynamic programming in ruled surface fitting","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/multi-dimensional-dynamic-programming-in-ruled-surface-fitting","Wang, C. C. L.; Elber, G.","15 Feb 2014","Ruled surfaces play an important role in many manufacturing and construction applications. In this work, we explore a multi-dimensional dynamic programming based ruled surface fitting scheme to a given freeform rational surface, S. Considering two initial opposite boundaries of S, sampled into a discrete piecewise linear polyline representation, the ruled surface fitting problem is reduced to a pairing-search between the polylines and elevations above the polylines, in the normal directions of S. A four-dimensional dynamic programming solution is sought for the four dimensions prescribed by the two polylines and the two elevation levels along the surface normals. This multi-dimensional dynamic programming is evaluated using highly parallel algorithms running on GPUs that ensures the best fit to the sampled data. In order to evaluate the fitting error with respect to S, we derive a scheme to compute a bound from above on the maximal error between a bilinear surface patch (formed by two consecutive point-pairs) and its corresponding surface region on S. Surface-surface composition is employed to extract the corresponding surface region on S to compare against. Finally, the above ruled surface fitting approach is also extended into a discrete algorithm to find the non-isoparametric subdivision curve on S when a discrete recursive piecewise-ruled surface fitting is considered. A five- or seven-dimensional dynamic programming solution is employed towards this end and once again, surface-surface composition is employed to extract the two subdivided patches as tensor products.","Programming","University of Manchester"
"Peptide detectability prediction following ESI mass spectrometry using genetic programming.","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/peptide-detectability-prediction-following-esi-mass-spectrometry-","Wedge, D.; Lau, K.; Gaskell, S.; Hubbard, S.; Kell, D.; Eyers, C.","9 Jul 2007","The accurate quantification of proteins is important in several areas of cell biology, biotechnology and medicine. Both relative and absolute quantification of proteins is often determined following mass spectrometric analysis of one or more of their constituent peptides. However, in order for quantification to be successful, it is important that the experimenter knows which peptides are readily detectable under the mass spectrometric conditions used for analysis. In this paper, genetic programming is used to develop a function which predicts the detectability of peptides from their calculated physico-chemical properties. Classification is carried out in two stages: the selection of a good classifier using the AUROC objective function and the setting of an appropriate threshold. This allows the user to select the balance point between conflicting priorities in an intuitive way. The success of this method is found to be highly dependent on the initial selection of input parameters. The use of brood recombination and a modified version of the multi-objective FOCUS method are also investigated. While neither has a significant effect on predictive accuracy, the use of the FOCUS method leads to considerably more compact solutions.","Programming","University of Manchester"
