Looking especially as cost-cutting labor strategies of contingent employment, importation of foreign workers, and the outsourcing of professional high-tech work, it is argued that these are essentially restrictive employment strategies that benefit employers at the expense of employees. While some of the interviewees more or less approved of these practices as logical from the corporate perspective, and were confident that their jobs were too complex to be at risk, most are questioning these processes and some were actively trying to organize in an effort to halt or at least slow down such trends. How and why high-tech workers accommodate or resist management policies and practices they disagree with is analyzed with attention to the impact of ideology.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Oda Nobunaga was the first of three military leaders who all played leading roles in unifying Japan (the other two being Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu). For a long period of time, access to Banshōji was limited to members of Japan’s military and financial elites.As head priest Daitō Gen’yū explains in this video, only around twenty extended family households were affiliated as parishioners of Banshōji before he took office. His tenure marked the construction of “eternal memorial graves” (eitai kuyōbo), an innovative grave model that flourished in response to societal changes in Japan’s rapidly shrinking and aging society. This video introduces several of Banshōji’s indoor graves and shows how different graves represent different aesthetics, needs, and financial plans. Viewers will notice the importance placed on light and the material features involved in making religious beliefs and practices visible and tangible at Banshōji. ","Tech","University of Manchester"

The study focuses on how entrepreneurs learn about business opportunities and explores the factors that affect the way they do it. A conceptual model is presented and then empirically tested. The results show that entrepreneurs learn strategically about business opportunities. Six learning strategies were identified as relevant to the process of opportunity identification. Prior knowledge of foreign markets was found as the most significant factor, while cognitive style was found to moderate the strength of the relationships between prior knowledge and the learning strategies. Entrepreneurs can benefit from these findings by recognising that they have a battery of learning strategies, which are relevant to the opportunity identification process. The identification of six learning strategies that are relevant to the process of opportunity identification is unique to this study.","Tech","University of Manchester"

"Evaluating Intellectual Property Rights in the Context of High-tech Global Value Chains/ Global Production Networks","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/evaluating-intellectual-property-rights-in-the-context-of-high-te","Chetverikova, O.","3 Sept 2019","The world economy has gone through significant changes that resulted in creation, spread and dominance of Global Value Chains (GVCs) and Global Production Networks (GPNs). The recent trend of further fine slicing within the chains and fragmentation of production has become possible partly due to the changes in trade and investment regulation. However, Intellectual Property (IP) has played a crucial role in those changes, especially in a high-tech sector that has been driven mainly by the interests of Multinational Enterprises (MNEs). As of today, one of the biggest challenges has been to regulate IPRs in the cases of 1st and 2nd tier suppliers plugged into transnational chains.The paper aims to address the existing asymmetry in literature and provide a legal analysis of the IPRs in their relevance to high-tech GVCs/GPNs. The specific choice of an inter-disciplinary approach has been made to ensure a comprehensive all-rounded legal evaluation of IP in the context of high-tech chains, which so far have been mainly the subject of an economic and developmental agenda. In particular, patents, utility models, technological processes, know-how and technology transfer will be evaluated in their scope and application under Indian, Japanese and EU legislation with the emphasis on the comparative assessment of relevant case law. It will further enable establishing links between IPRs functioning on a national level and international regime via TRIPs. The paper will also cover the challenges of compulsory licensing in India and its potential impact on IPRs.Overall, the paper will benefit PhD students and legal scholars specialising in IP and technology transfer as well as professionals researching on GVCs/GPNs and IP. It will also be beneficial to a wider audience.","Tech","University of Manchester"
"Design reuse and buffers in high-tech infrastructure development: A stakeholder perspective","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/design-reuse-and-buffers-in-high-tech-infrastructure-development-","Gil, N.; Beckman, S.","Aug 2007","This study investigates the implementation of design reuse and buffers in developing the infrastructure of high-tech production facilities Design reuse entails using the same systems architecture from one project to the next. Design buffers involve building slack into a proven systems architecture to absorb foreseeable change requests. Choosing the appropriate amounts of reuse and slack is dependent on the uncertainty in the manufacturing technology over the infrastructure life cycle. While proven infrastructure designs can economically accommodate incremental changes in technology, adaptation costs escalate when sufficient buffers are not built-in and changes are radical. We uncover opposing stakeholder interests in determining the extent to which reuse or buffers are used. Design reuse is attractive to the client to reduce the risk that a facility fails to perform, but limits the designer's job to tedious customization work. Design buffers are attractive to the designer to do original problem-solving and limit the risks of being unresponsive to uncertainty, but not to the client who is not guaranteed that the investments will pay off. We find that inequalities between the two stakeholders in the governing power on design decision-making compound the difficulties in assessing and implementing the reuse versus buffers tradeoff. © 2007 IEEE.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Examining the responses of 200 Chinese R&D and marketing managers, an exploratory investigation of marketing and R&D integration in Chinese high technology firms was undertaken. Study results find that Chinese high technology firms with higher levels of achieved integration perform better. It was also found that R&D involvement in screening new product ideas, designing communication strategies for the customers of new products, training users of new products and analysing customer needs appear to be top priorities for R&D integration in Chinese companies. These and other results are compared to prior findings in US and Japanese samples to support general propositions for R&D-marketing integration. We offer explanations for the results and discuss theoretical development of the R&D-marketing integration construct. Future research considerations are presented to spur continued focus in this area. © 2010 Imperial College Press.","Tech","University of Manchester"
"Is corporate R&D investment in high-tech sectors more effective?","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/is-corporate-rampd-investment-in-high-tech-sectors-more-effective","Ortega-Argilés, R.; Piva, M.; Potters, L.; Vivarelli, M.","18 Jun 2010","This paper discusses the link between R&D and productivity across the European industrial and service sectors. The empirical analysis is based on both the European sectoral OECD data and on a unique micro-longitudinal database consisting of 532 top European R&D investors. The main conclusions are as follows. First, the R&D stock has a significant positive impact on labor productivity; this general result is largely consistent with previous literature in terms of the sign, the significance, and the magnitude of the estimated coefficients. More interestingly, both at sectoral and firm levels the R&D coefficient increases monotonically (both in significance and magnitude) when we move from the low-tech to the medium- and high-tech sectors. This outcome means that corporate R&D investment is more effective in the high-tech sectors and this may need to be taken into account when designing policy instruments (subsidies, fiscal incentives, etc.) in support of private R&D. However, R&D investment is not the sole source of productivity gains; technological change embodied in gross investment is of comparable importance on aggregate and is the main determinant of productivity increase in the low-tech sectors. Hence, an economic policy aiming to increase productivity in the low-tech sectors should support overall capital formation.","Tech","University of Manchester"

We use a unique longitudinal database consisting of 1809 US and European manufacturing and service firms over the period 1990–2008. Our main findings can be summarised as follows. Consistently with previous literature, the knowledge stock has a significant positive impact on a firm's productivity. More interestingly, the coefficient turns out to be significantly larger in the R&D-user services and high-tech manufacturing sectors than in the non-high-tech manufacturing sectors. Contrary to the ‘latecomer advantage’ approach, these outcomes suggest that firms in high-tech sectors are still ahead in terms of impact on productivity of R&D investments.","Tech","University of Manchester"

D.","26 Jun 2022","“Big Tech” platform companies like Alphabet (Google), Apple, and Amazon are deeply invested in the future of automobility—from developing car-specific interfaces and self-driving technology to establishing business partnerships with automakers. Far from business-as-usual, we explain how Big Tech is reshaping the traditional automotive industry by making the car “platform ready,” as imposed on the web before it. The article considers how this novel transformation of automobility is increasingly significant for critical scholars of social media, platforms, and platformization, as bespoke forms of mediated, datafied, and platformized, sociality emerge. Specifically, we identify six levels upon which this platformization of automobility is unfolding and through which Big Tech is reorganizing the automotive industry according to platform logics concerning programmability, modularity, connectivity, data collection, and developmental partnerships. We do so by analyzing academic and technical literature, industry reports, and initiatives with a stake in platform automobility. Finally, we suggest directions for further research into Big Tech’s stake in the future of automobility, as these new dynamics begin to reshape the automotive industry at large.","Tech","University of Manchester"

"Whither 'high-tech' labor? Codification and (de-)skilling in automotive components value chains","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/whither-high-tech-labor-codification-and-de-skilling-in-automotiv","Machacek, E.; Hess, M.","7 Feb 2019","This paper seeks to address the limits of the global value chain (GVC) framework for explaining processes of deskilling in the changing international division of labor, outsourcing and offshoring. In the GVC framework, deskilling is insufficiently addressed in the context of social upgrading which usually focuses on measureable labor standards and enabling rights. Using a case study of component manufacturing in the automotive sector, this study shows that a critical understanding of the codification process is key for identifying how deskilling occurs within international divisions of labor in a high-tech industry. The paper draws on Michael Polanyi’s conceptualization of tacit knowledge and Harry Braverman’s work on labor and monopoly capital to refine and frame the role of codification in GVC governance structures. Currently, explanations of the ability to codify knowledge center on a technical and, at most, implicit experiential dimension of tacit knowledge (the know-how acquired through experience), and thus only on one of two constituents of Polanyi’s conceptualization. Yet the cognitive dimension, which relies on the articulation and sharing of experiences, imitation, performance and other forms of knowledge exchange among workers, is largely absent. This is detrimental to explaining the complex processes of deskilling within GVCs. Empirically, our argument is illustrated by analyzing intra-firm decisions on codifying information for the manufacturing of automotive magnet components in Europe and in the magnet industry hub of Ningbo, China. Specifically, we discuss how these decisions liberate some workers in some places for skill upgrading (upskilling), but are clearly limiting many others to perform routine tasks removed from any innovative collaboration, i.e. (relative) deskilling. The paper finds an international division of labor facilitated and maintained to no small extent by intra-firm decision-making on knowledge codification, with mixed results for skills upgrading and (relative) deskilling.","Tech","University of Manchester"

The traditional internationalization theories suggest that the firm's international involvement increases in stages as a result of incremental learning. However, the small information and communications technology (ICT) companies are often characterized as born globals, showing very rapid and intensive international growth enabled by the use of external resources, such as partnerships and networks. Adopting a knowledge-based view of the firm has proved to be a useful way to theoretically explain the internationalization process of these ICT SMEs. However, in our view, the crucial dynamic aspects of knowledge development have not received enough attention in previous empirical studies, which have typically been more like static snapshots. In this paper, we will first launch an evolutionary knowledge management model, derive then its basic theoretical propositions and finally test them empirically in terms of a longitudinal survey of small- and medium-sized software and content providers in the Finnish ICT-sector (from the year 1999 to 2001). Most of the results are straightforward and show that at least some of the proposed knowledge-related determinants really have significant effects on the dynamics of internationalization.","Tech","University of Manchester"

A.; Blome, C.; Papadopoulos, T.","15 May 2019","The scarcity of IT resources and technological advancements in high-tech small and medium enterprises (SMEs) require leaders to embed IT ambidexterity – simultaneous pursuit of IT exploitation and IT exploration activities – into their organization’s strategy, which could be challenging. To better understand how leaders enable IT ambidexterity, this study focuses on the leadership decision-making style (directive decision-making and participative decision-making) as a key driving factor. Moreover, we examine how and when leadership decision-making styles are most effective in enacting IT ambidexterity by considering new product development (NPD) team diversity and shared vision as two important contingencies. Finally, we test the role of IT ambidexterity in improving NPD performance. We analyse our research model using survey data from 292 high-tech SMEs. Our findings suggest that both decision-making styles enable IT ambidexterity, however, participative decision-making style is more effective in highly diverse NPD teams and directive decision-making style should be preferred when shared vision is a dominant factor among NPD team members. Our results also show that IT ambidexterity significantly enhances NPD performance. We discuss our contribution to information systems (IS) and ambidexterity research and provide implications for practice.","Tech","University of Manchester"

M. C.; Aldred, M. L.","Jun 2011","Purpose: This paper aims to assess the extent to which convergence in institutional regimes is likely to occur, by examining all ten new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe in terms of their development of comparative advantages in high-tech export markets either by drawing on foreign investors in the form of multinational companies or by making use of domestic institutional resources. Design/methodology/approach: The article uses fuzzy sets and qualitative comparative analysis to examine both necessary and sufficient causes of success in high-tech export markets. By doing so, it can address the important issue of institutional complementarity. Findings: While it finds that countries that have stronger records in such markets share common features, there are also important differences between them - not least in the areas of employee relations. This, together with other evidence presented in the paper, suggests that convergence around a specific institutional model is unlikely to happen. Originality/value: Analysing, unlike many previous studies, all ten new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe enables conclusions to be drawn that apply to the whole region. The novel method used in this article means that the extent of any complementarity between different institutions can be addressed, and ensures that issues relating to convergence/divergence are explored. The article, therefore, contributes to a number of important debates on the convergence among types of capitalism, the dependency of the new EU member states on foreign investors, and the institutional foundations for success in high-tech export markets. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Tech","University of Manchester"

This article charts the development of this debate, in particular examining the controversial decision to locate the MFP in what its critics regard as a polluted swamp in the north of Adelaide. This paper outlines the concept of the MFP, looks at the environmental issues which the MFP raises for creating sustainable urban development, and seeks to identify some of the challenges to urban planning and urban governance raised by the MFP. In this respect, some interesting tensions have arisen between the different strands of the MFP debate, where commercial viability and political credibility have become a central issue for investors, whilst environmental issues have emerged as a pivotal theme in gaining community acceptance of the MFP proposal. -from Author","Tech","University of Manchester"

"Entering the Asian developmental state in high-tech and service industries: the case of Italian SMEs in China and Japan","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/entering-the-asian-developmental-state-in-high-tech-and-service-i","Corsi, S.","Jul 2010","From an industrial policy point of view, Japan and China show similar attitudes towards a progressive opening of their market economies even though they pursuit it in different periods. The two countries share also a good economic planning run by an effective bureaucracy. Japanese industrial system has always been regarded as a state controlled relationship network amongst firms (Gerlach, 1992; Lincoln et al, 1992). During the '80s and '90s, these particular features and business practices have been described as one of the main sources of competitive advantage for the Japanese manufacturing system (Imai, 1986; Lincoln et al, 1996, Lincoln et al , 1998).On the other side foreign manufacturing firms have looked at the Chinese industrial system as a low cost one and they therefore delocalize there consistent parts of their activities. Nowadays mostly foreign service and high-tech firms  look at China as a competitive and important market both for selling and for product development (Child, Tse, 2001). In both cases foreign firms face difficulties both in entry processes and in establishing regular and profitable activities because of cultural distance, different institutions, scarce resources, and so on. From a micro perspective the two investigated countries show similarities in typical business practices (Hofstede, 1980). In particular they seem to share a strong attitude towards long-term business relationships (Dyer et al, 2001; Leung et al, 2005). These relations shape the markets in interconnected business networks and allow to overcome traditional and pure market mechanisms. Moreover long-term relationships help innovation processes in terms of flexibility and knowledge sharing as well as time-to-market and cost reduction (Herbig et al, 1996).We use case study research to collect data on Italian service and high-tech small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that operate in China and Japan and we try to understand if a competitive advantage can be earned from local business practices and if it can be replicated in the country of origin. This study represents a first effort aimed at refining the research questions above and it will be used to focus our ongoing research in a more focused direction. Our current data suggest that, despite major changes in the investigated systems have occurred during the last years, SMEs can still earn a competitive advantage on the Chinese and Japanese markets from such local business practices. However our focal firms seem to face difficulties replying these advantages in their country of origin because of cultural distance and differences in industrial systems organization.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Despite the Italian industrial system being only marginally present in the Japanese market, in comparison to other European countries, interesting interaction dynamics are detectable between Japanese and Italian industrial companies active in medium and high-tech technology sectors. By adopting the Uppsala Model for internationalization and the IMP Group relationship marketing perspective approach, four case studies of Italian companies who successfully invested in Japan are addressed. The companies are analyzed with respect to their entry strategies and to their progressive commitment into the Japanese market, following a stage-based approach aiming at further strengthening their credibility. The common aspects in the process of Italian firms approaching the market are passed in review and properly discussed in the last section of the paper, together with difficulties and peculiarities characterizing the integration of foreign companies in the local supply chains. Moreover, the role of Japan as a “learing market” for the investing firms is considered, especially in terms of acquired competitive advantages and potential gains to be exploited also in other attractable markets for their business.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Based on a survey of active users of mobile telecommunications services in Taiwan, we obtained the following findings. First, we found that empathy, network quality, reliability, and assurance, but not tangibles and responsiveness, have a significant effect on service quality and value perception. Second, the effect of overall service quality on brand equity is partially mediated by perceived value. Third, overall service quality has differential mediation effects on the relationships between specific service quality dimensions and perceived value. Finally, empathy and network quality have direct effects on brand equity. For managers, our study suggests the importance of identifying key service drivers for building strong service brand for high-tech service firms. The identification of key service drivers could then enable these firms to make strategic decisions on services investments. It also demonstrates the importance of the humanisation of technology for services firms. This study is original in that it explores the path from specific services qualities to service brand equity.","Tech","University of Manchester"

However, biology already has a long tradition of collaboration, as natural historians were part of the first collective scientific efforts: exploring the variety of life on earth. Such mappings of life still continue today, and if field biology is gradually becoming an important subject of studies into big science, research into life in the world's oceans is not taken into account yet. This paper therefore explores marine biology as big science, presenting the historical development of marine research towards the international 'Census of Marine Life' (CoML) making an inventory of life in the world's oceans. Discussing various aspects of collaboration - including size, internationalisation, research practice, technological developments, application, and public communication - I will ask if CoML still resembles traditional collaborations to collect life. While showing both continuity and change, I will argue that marine biology is a form of natural history: a specific way of working together in biology that has transformed substantially in interaction with recent developments in the life sciences and society. As a result, the paper does not only give an overview of transformations towards large scale research in marine biology, but also shines a new light on big biology, suggesting new ways to deepen the understanding of collaboration in the life sciences by distinguishing between different 'collective ways of knowing'. © 2013 Vermeulen.","Marine","University of Manchester"

W.","Dec 2005","The transition from Rotliegend to Zechstein within the Southern Permian Basin is one from continental desert to a marine environment. During the Upper Rotliegend II a huge playa lake existed there. This lake was temporarily influenced by precursors of the Zechstein transgression. Therefore the mega-playa evolved into a sabkha system. One of these early marine ingressions is known from an outcrop in Schleswig-Holstein. Laminated silt- and claystones, deposited within a standing water body, are intercalated in siltstones of a salt-flat environment. The lake sediments are characterised by high frequency cyclicity, shown by the sedimentary record and also by palaeontological data. The section contains fresh water as well as brackish-marine and marine fauna. Climatically forced cycles interact with marine incursions. After the Zechstein transgression had flooded the basin completely, sedimentation was controlled by sea-level fluctuations. Two sections, in the southern North Sea and in Schleswig-Holstein, are presented in this paper. Cyclicities with different frequencies controlled the sedimentation of the Kupferschiefer (T1) and the Werra Carbonate (Ca1). Sediments of the North Sea sequence were deposited within a shallow bay at the margin of an elevation. Therefore, the high frequency cyclicity became obvious within the sedimentary patterns and in the faunal content. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Marine","University of Manchester"

In hostile environments where safety considerations are important, vibration isolators are often used to suppress the effects of vibrations. The system described here is based on a four degree-of-freedom active marine suspension model, which allows for effective disturbance rejection. Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is then used to reduce the disturbance simulated as random sea waves.

In this chapter we outline the major types of marine sediment (lithogenous, biogenic, hydrogeneous and authigenic), discuss the sources of these and their chemical and mineral characteristics. The most abundant minerals are (oxyhydr)oxides, clay minerals, sulfides and carbonates, and all of these have been studied extensively, using a range of mineralogical techniques. A major aim of this chapter is to provide a framework by which the mineral transformations that take place upon, or just below, the sea-floor can be understood. There are significant thermodynamic, kinetic and biological controls on these transformations, and the interaction of these plays a major role in element cycling between the oceans and the lithosphere, and trace element-enrichment on the sea-floor and carbon burial and remineralization. Further, we conclude that more research is required on the interactions between minerals and bacteria within marine sediments, and on the role of amorphous oxide minerals delivered from land in early burial reactions and mineral precipitations.Oceans cover ∼70% of the Earthâ∈™s surface so that the processes operating within the marine realm and upon ocean floors play a marked role in element and nutrient cycling, biological productivity, ultimately exerting an important influence on global climate. This chapter will focus on the distribution, composition and mineralogy of sediments that are actively accumulating on the sea floor, both in the shallow marine and deep ocean realms. Further, it will describe the geochemical and mineralogical processes operating in these sediments.","Marine","University of Manchester"

The present study in the East Mingulay Special Area of Conservation (a Marine Protected Area in the Sea of the Hebrides, western Scotland) used historic surveys and benthic samples to obtain baseline levels of anthropogenic debris and microparticle ingestion. Most debris identified in the MPA was fisheries-related. A total of 11% of benthic macrofauna from Mingulay Reef Area 1 and Banana Reef had ingested microplastics, with no statistically significant effect of feeding guild, station, or reef, on ingestion rates. However, the ingestion rate was highest at a station located in a topographic hollow along a gentle sloping area with strong variable ocean currents where fine-scale interactions between bathymetry and hydrography may have helped trap and focus microparticles. Raman spectroscopy of microparticles revealed several types of polymers being ingested, tentatively identified as polypropylene (PP), polyurethane (PU), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Besides establishing a baseline assessment of marine litter and microparticles in a deep-water setting, the approach demonstrates the utility of using historic data and specimens collected for other purposes to expand the geographic and ecosystem coverage for larger more regional-scale and even basin-wide assessments such as those needed to inform Good Environmental Status in European waters, as called for by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.","Marine","University of Manchester"

Higher cloud droplet density would increase these clouds' reflectivity to incoming sunlight, and possibly their longevity. This approach is therefore a more localized application of the marine cloud brightening (MCB) geoengineering technique promoting global cooling. By utilizing a climate ocean/atmosphere coupled model, HadGEM1, we demonstrate that—subject to the satisfactory resolution of defined but unresolved issues—judicious seeding of maritime stratocumulus clouds might significantly reduce sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in regions where hurricanes develop. Thus artificial seeding may reduce hurricane intensity; but how well the magnitude of this effect could be controlled is yet to be determined.","Marine","University of Manchester"

Over the last decade, the design of tidal stream devices has progressed rapidly and several horizontal-axis turbines are now undergoing prototype trials at offshore test sites. However, there is limited understanding of how the loading, power output and wakes of TST are affected by the ambient turbulence of the tidal flows that are suitable for energy extraction.

E.; Smith, T. J.; Suleiman, R.; Akid, R.","Dec 2013","Following the ban in 2003 on the use of tributyl-tin compounds in antifouling coatings, the search for an environmentally-friendly alternative has accelerated. Biocidal TBT alternatives, such as diuron and Irgarol 1051®,1 have proved to be environmentally damaging to marine organisms. The issue regarding the use of biocides is that concerning the half-life of the compounds which allow a perpetuation of the toxic effects into the marine food chain, and initiate changes in the early stages of the organisms' life-cycle. In addition, the break-down of biocides can result in metabolites with greater toxicity and longevity than the parent compound. Functionalized coatings have been designed to repel the settlement and permanent attachment of fouling organisms via modification of either or both surface topography and surface chemistry, or by interfering with the natural mechanisms via which fouling organisms settle upon and adhere to surfaces. A large number of technologies are being developed towards producing new coatings that will be able to resist biofouling over a period of years and thus truly replace biocides as antifouling systems. In addition urgent research is directed towards the exploitation of mechanisms used by living organisms designed to repel the settlement of fouling organisms. These biomimetic strategies include the production of antifouling enzymes and novel surface topography that are incompatible with permanent attachment, for example, by mimicking the microstructure of shark skin. Other research seeks to exploit chemical signals and antimicrobial agents produced by diverse living organisms in the environment to prevent settlement and growth of fouling organisms on vulnerable surfaces. Novel polymer-based technologies may prevent fouling by means of unfavourable surface chemical and physical properties or by concentrating antifouling compounds around surfaces.","Marine","University of Manchester"

Good agreement with the time series of IO measured at a midlatitude coastal station was achieved by using a reaction scheme that included recycling of iodine through marine aerosol. The strong diurnal variation in IO observed in the subtropical Atlantic was satisfactorily modeled by assuming a constant concentration of iodocarbons that photolyzed to produce roughly 1 × 104 iodine atoms cm-3 s-1 at midday. The significance of the occurrence of IO at concentrations of up to 4 parts per trillion in the marine boundary layer was then considered from three angles. First, the iodine-catalyzed destruction of ozone was shown to be of a magnitude similar to that caused by odd-hydrogen photochemistry, with up to 13% of the available ozone destroyed per day in a marine air mass. Second, the enrichment factor of iodine in marine aerosol compared with surface seawater was predicted to increase to values of several thousand, in sensible accord with observations. Most of the enrichment should be due to the accumulation of iodate, although other iodine species may also be present, depending on the rate of aerosol recycling. Third, the denoxification of the marine boundary layer was found to be significantly enhanced as a result of aerosol uptake of IONO2, formed from the recombination of IO with NO2.

K.; Macquaker, J. H. S.; Marshall, J. D.","May 2006","Siderite rhizocretions are generally considered to be an indicator of fresh-water conditions. The presence of siderite rhizocretions with a marine δ 18O isotope signature in the Rutland Formation, Ketton, U.K. seems to contradict this belief. Commonly, in marine settings pyrite is more prevalent than siderite because of the high concentrations of sulfate in seawater. The Rutland Formation is a fine-grained mixed carbonate-clastic succession with interbedded coals that was deposited in marginal marine conditions. Analysis of siderite revealed that it was chemically zoned, predated pyrite, and has an average δ 18O signature of +0.44‰. This siderite is interpreted as having precipitated during early diagenesis from brackish to marine porewaters containing low concentrations of bioavailable organic matter. Despite the porewaters being dominantly marine, under conditions of restricted organic-matter quality and/or quantity Fe(III)-reducing bacteria can outcompete sulfate-reducing bacteria for the organic substrate, resulting in the precipitation of siderite at the expense of pyrite.

The expert system is the first of its kind that consists of multiple concurrently activated BRB subsystems, in which each subsystem has its distinctive outputs and uses the evidential reasoning approach for inference. This novel modeling approach can be applied to identify fault modes that may co-exist. In essence, the group of BRB subsystems is used to model the nonlinear relationships between the fault features and the fault modes in marine diesel engines. The initial BRB expert system can be established by using expert experience and then optimized by using the data samples accumulated during the operation of marine diesel engines. Due to limitations in knowledge and data collected, ignorance is also considered in some BRB subsystems. The proposed BRB expert system is applied to abnormal wear detection for a kind of marine diesel engine. The performance of the BRB expert system is investigated in comparison with that of artificial neural network (ANN) models, support vector machine (SVM) models, and binary logistic regression model with fivefold cross-validation. The results show that the BRB expert system can be used for fault diagnosis of marine diesel engines in a probabilistic manner, which outperforms the ANN models, SVM models, and the binary logistic regression model in terms of accuracy and stability, and can effectively identify concurrent faults.","Marine","University of Manchester"

"The evolution of monogamy in cichlids and marine reef fishes","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/the-evolution-of-monogamy-in-cichlids-and-marine-reef-fishes","Stanbrook, E.; Fitzpatrick, JL.; Balshine, S.; Shultz, S.","22 Dec 2022","Although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the emergence of social monogamy, its origin is still intensely debated. Monogamy has many potential drivers, but evolutionary causality among them remains unclear. Using phylogenetic comparative methods within a Bayesian framework we explored the evolution of monogamy in cichlids and in marine reef fishes because, while both groups are characterised by unusually high incidence of social monogamy, they face very different ecological challenges. For each group, we examined four classic hypotheses that explain the evolution of monogamy: female dispersal, male mate guarding, female–female intolerance, and the biparental care hypotheses. We also explored whether the ecological traits of diet and shelter use are evolutionarily coupled with these hypotheses or with monogamy. First, we found that the evolution of monogamy was predicted by male territoriality in cichlids and simultaneous male and female territoriality in marine reef fishes. We suggest that these results provide support for the male mate guarding hypothesis in cichlids and female–female intolerance hypothesis in marine reef fishes. Second, we demonstrate clear evidence against the biparental care hypothesis, as biparental care was a consequence, not a cause, of monogamy in our analyses. Third, as female dispersal drove the loss of monogamy in both cichlids and marine reef fishes, this suggests the female dispersal hypothesis is not driving the evolution of monogamy in either group. These findings in two highly-monogamous fish taxa largely support prior findings from primate and bird comparative studies and provide novel large-scale evidence for a link between mate guarding and the evolution of monogamy.","Marine","University of Manchester"

This work represents the most comprehensive evaluation of oceanic OM emission inventories to date, by employing aerosol composition measurements obtained from campaigns with wide spatial and temporal coverage. The model underestimates AOD over the remote ocean on average by 0.02 (21 %), compared to satellite observations, but provides an unbiased simulation of ground-based Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations. Comparison with cruise data demonstrates that the GEOS-Chem simulation of marine sulfate, with the mean observed values ranging between 0.22 μg mg-3 and 1.34 μg m-3, is generally unbiased, however surface organic matter (OM) concentrations, with the mean observed concentrations between 0.07 μg mg-3 and 0.77 μg mg -3, are underestimated by a factor of 2-5 for the standard model run. Addition of a sub-micron marine OM source of approximately 9 TgC yr -1 brings the model into agreement with the ship-based measurements, however this additional OM source does not explain the model underestimate of marine AOD. The model underestimate of marine AOD is therefore likely the result of a combination of satellite retrieval bias and a missing marine aerosol source (which exhibits a different spatial pattern than existing aerosol in the model). © 2011 Author(s).","Marine","University of Manchester"

The inoculum was obtained from arsenic-rich shallow marine hydrothermal sediment from Santorini, Greece, with evidence of arsenic redox cycling. Growth studies demonstrated M. santoriniensis NKSG1T is capable of conserving energy from the reduction of arsenate As(V) with acetate or lactate as the electron donor, and of oxidizing arsenite As(III) heterotrophically with oxygen as the electron acceptor. The oxidation of As(III) coincided with the expression of the aoxB gene encoding for the catalytic molybdopterin subunit of the heterodimeric arsenite oxidase operon, indicating the reaction is enzymatically controlled, and M. santoriniensis NKSG1T is a heterotrophic As(III)-oxidizing bacterium. Although it is clear that this organism also performs dissimilatory As(V) reduction, no amplification of the arrA arsenate reductase gene was attained using a range of primers and PCR conditions.

Maintenance cost is usually significant within these organisations and cannot be ignored by the organization management and for that reason it is one of the essential measurements of the organization and success. Measuring the maintenance performance is used as indicator for potential organizational development and has a great effect on the performance of the entire organization. In the marine industry in particular, maintenance performance measurement (MPM) requires the consideration of a large number of variables and factors which can often be difficult to define and assess. In order to accommodate the complex set of criteria that needs to be assessed in the measurement process, this paper sets out a methodology to capture the necessary data as part of a wider asset management strategy. In this paper an interpretive approach is adapted to identify the ship maintenance performance measurement (SMPM) indicators. A case study is carried out on three Kuwaiti marine shipping companies which cover different trade interests ranging from small transport ships to large oil tankers. Semi-structured interviews are conducted with six senior staff experts from the three shipping companies. The interviews are conducted at the strategic, corporate and tactical managerial levels. The paper identifies and investigates the relevant measuring indicators and concludes on the importance of the maintenance performance measurement. The outputs from this research draw on maintenance and asset management theories generally and can be transposed to other disciplines where complex, high value assets require significant maintenance management.","Marine","University of Manchester"

It is argued here that the trial offers a prism through which to explore wider anxieties that the generation who fought the Second World War held during the late 1960s. It maps how contemporary generational tensions, fears of national decline, and concerns about distorted cultural representations of war in Britain were embedded into the trial. This libel case thus became invested with considerable cultural significance among an ageing community of wartime survivors who were intent upon safeguarding wider memories of ‘their’ war.","Navy","University of Manchester"

In particular, historians have overlooked the division between the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. Yet portrayals of the two navies differed widely. Maritime films both during and after the war followed a well-established tradition of representing the navy as a force of disciplined and respectable men led by gentlemen heroes that reliably defended nation and empire. Such representations rarely acknowledged the existence of the Merchant Navy with its globally recruited and racially mixed workforce and its troubling associations with indiscipline. Yet naval operations largely concerned its protection, and the British war effort depended on the goods it transported. In the context of the leftward drift of wartime politics, the Merchant Navy received rare attention in a 1943 film that nevertheless avoided depicting non-white merchant seaman or disturbing the gender division. After the war the focus of maritime films returned to the Royal Navy. The liminal presence of the Merchant Navy in films of the 1950s was, however, significant. It was, variously, the vector for the expression of British insecurities about the wartime victory, the occasion for the portrayal of the enemy as an honourable foe, and a means to both romanticize, and hint at the fragility of, imperial masculinity. © The Author [2011].

One class of methods examine the frequency content of the noise signal. The first such method to be used was conventional spectral analysis, initially using the Fourier Transform, and subsequently the Maximum Entropy Method. Apart from questions over the relative merits of the two methods, the estimation of the power spectrum suffers from the formal requirement that the signal being analysed is stationary, since corrosion processes are frequently non-stationary. This has lead to the use of alternative analysis methods that do not require the signal to be stationary, including wavelet analysis and, more recently, the Hilbert-Huang transform. It is not always appreciated that the wavelet method was developed as an extension of the Fourier transform and that there is a close relationship between the two methods. This paper will explore this relationship and implications for the analysis of electrochemical noise.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Additionally it incorporates fast Fourier transform as a technique to determine the distribution of power over frequency. Finally, it integrates the study of transient shape into the analysis of (time-) frequency properties. It is shown that the maxima in instantaneous frequency amplitudes of transients with otherwise different shapes can be similar. In the case of the presence of multiple transients in the EN signal, the cut-off frequency obtained from power spectral density plots is related to maxima in instantaneous frequency amplitudes of only a limited number of transients.","Navy","University of Manchester"

From 1592 to 1598, the Chosŏn dynasty suffered invasions from Japan that displaced much of the Korean population and devastated the economy and environment. The crucial role of the navy during the war, along with a dire postwar situation, heightened government anxieties about deforestation and timber scarcity. Thus, in the seventeenth century, the Chosŏn government expanded administration over forests, particularly pine forests, across the coasts and islands of southwestern Korea. The key vehicle for the expansion was the military. Due to wartime and postwar exigencies, the military became the late Chosŏn state’s primary organ for management of wood resources for state purposes. Furthermore, the growth of pine-centric state forests and shifts in military priorities would significantly reshape Korean ecologies.","Navy","University of Manchester"

The demands of nationalist legitimation appear to pressure the elite to respond to popular nationalism. Should one or more Chinese die at the hands of the Japanese navy or air force, therefore, the popular pressure for escalation and war will likely be more than China’s leaders can manage.","Navy","University of Manchester"

One of the towering figures of this epoch is W.V. Quine (1908-2000), champion of naturalism in philosophy of science, pioneer of mathematical logic, trying to unite an austerely physicalist theory of the world with the truths of mathematics, psychology, and linguistics. Quine's posthumous papers, notes, and drafts revealing the development of his views in the forties have recently begun to be published, as well as careful philosophical studies of, for instance, the evolution of his key doctrine that mathematical and logical truth are continuous with, not divorced from, the truths of natural science. But one central text has remained unexplored: Quine's Portuguese-language book on logic, his 'farewell for now' to the discipline as he embarked on an assignment in the Navy in WWII. Anglophone philosophers have neglected this book because they could not read it. Jointly with colleagues, I have completed the first full English translation of this book. In this accompanying paper I  draw out the main philosophical contributions Quine made in the book, placing them in their historical context and relating them to Quine's overall philosophical development during the period. Besides significant developments in the evolution of Quine's views on meaning and analyticity, I argue, this book is also driven by Quine's indebtedness to Russell and Whitehead, Tarski, and Frege, and contains crucial developments in his thinking on philosophy of logic and ontology. This includes early versions of some arguments from 'On What There Is', four-dimensionalism, and virtual set theory.","Navy","University of Manchester"

W. S.; Mitchell, N.; Zahradnik, J.; Dias, F.; do Nascimento, A. F.","20 Nov 2021","Uncertainties in epicentral locations and hypocentral depths often prevent earthquakes from being associated with individual or group of faults in bathymetric data, thus limiting the understanding of tectonic behavior. Ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) can overcome this problem, but they take significant efforts to build and deploy, so information from them covers only a minor part of the earthquake record of mid-ocean ridges. As an alternative, a combination of records from seismometers at regional distances and appropriate processing methods can yield location and depth estimates that are useful because they provide extensive data. We illustrate this with a study of magnitude of the seismicity in the 4–5°N Mid-Atlantic Ridge using data from seismometers in Brazil, Cape Verdes, and Africa coast. The seismicity occurred in swarms in 2012 (seven events), 2014 (five events), 2016 (62 events), and 2019 (eight events). We compare the seismicity with features using bathymetric data collected with a multibeam sonars, which reveal two detachment fault surfaces (“megamullions”), one close to the modern rift valley floor but offset by ~10 km from it. The located seismicity is shallow (best estimate less than 8 km below seafloor). The swarms occurred over two segments of the ridge and, in the 2016 case, clearly involved movements on widely distributed multiple faults, including faults on both sides of the valley. Although the methods used produce epicenters and hypocenters with uncertainties that are still larger than those of OBS experiments, they could provide a way to study whether seismicity is systematically deep in certain parts of the ridge where megamullions are observed.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Shifts in ownership from the state to private hands or pious foundations put further stress on the state’s traditional fiscal base. Christ argues that the sultans increased taxation and state intervention in response, and thus that control of the international transit trade turned out to be particularly profitable. In order to tap it more effectively, the Mamluk sultanate reinforced ties with the Venetians in the Mediterranean and the Rasulids in the Red Sea. Relations were grounded in an ambiguous language of gift exchange which allowed for the harmonization of nominal hierarchical difference and de facto bilateral, symbiotic exchange. On the basis of shared trade interests, the Mamluks delegated power over the ‘Two Seas’. This delegation was not perfect though; the Mamluks also sought to establish a direct if only seasonal fiscal presence in the Egyptian gateways of this trade in Alexandria, Upper Egypt and the Hijaz , thus combining delegation on the seas with tighter control in the ports in order to channel the lucrative transit trade through their Cairo power base.","Navy","University of Manchester"

One of the first initiatives following the establishment of the alliance's Science Committee was the creation of a sub-group devoted to marine science: the Sub-committee on Oceanographic Research.This paper explores the history of this organization, charts its trajectory over the 13 years of its existence, and considers its activities in light of NATO's naval defence strategies. In particular it shows how the alliance's naval commands played a key role in the sub-committee's creation due to the importance of oceanographic research in the tracking of enemy submarines. The essay also scrutinizes the reasons behind the committee's dissolution, with a special focus on the changing landscape of scientific collaboration at NATO. The committee's fall maps onto a more profound shift in the alliance's research agenda, including the re-organization of defence research and the rise of environmentalism. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Navy","University of Manchester"

This article draws on a concept of popular memory that suggests that rival versions of the past compete for cultural centrality, to ask how Dunkirk acquired this position. During the war, accounts stressed the importance of the sea in the 'deliverance', but while some focused on the Navy, others concentrated on the civilian small boats, and criticism was rare. Immediately postwar there was a lull in representations. In the 1950s, attention switched to the land and to the problematic place of the defeated Army in the story, culminating in Ealing Studios' film Dunkirk (1958). Ealing attempted to synthesize previous emphases and struggled to achieve agreement about the representation of the evacuation. The film ensured the public prominence of the memory of Dunkirk, yet its reception was fractured along class and gender lines, indicating the instabilities of Ealing's negotiated consensus. The history of the contested inscription of Dunkirk in British culture emphasizes that at no point since the events occurred has the representation of the second world war been secure; the popular memory of the war is continually subject to construction, contestation and revision. © 2010 The Author.","Navy","University of Manchester"

After a big fire destroyed most of the mangrove surrounding the colony in 1975, people strived to create spaces of order to offset what was perceived as a loss of the familiar. By forging a conception of the mangrove as heritage and enacting selected replays of the past, residents succeed in granting legitimacy to what would otherwise be a simulacrum of a fishing colony. According to residents, the rituals are performed in order ‘not to let the colony’s identity die’, and to preserve the most important ‘heritage’ in the colony, the mangrove. This paper focuses on people’s readings of history and on the local versions of how the mangrove was sculpted over time. It explores people’s nostalgic perception of land and community after the mangrove became environmentally precarious and started being administered by the municipal Department of Environment. Nostalgia mediates the tension between tradition and progress, refashioning the mangrove as a moral agent and re-negotiating the paradoxical outcomes of development","Navy","University of Manchester"

We used two analysis techniques with independent estimates of the noise mmodels for the pulsar observations and different algorithms for obtaining the pulsar timescale. The two analyses agree within the estimated uncertainties and both agree with TT(BIPM17), a post-corrected timescale produced by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). We show that both methods could detect significant errors in TT(BIPM17) if they were present. We estimate the stability of the atomic clocks from which TT(BIPM17) is derived using observations of four rubidium fountain clocks at the US Naval Observatory. Comparing the power spectrum of TT(IPTA16) with that of these fountain clocks suggests that pulsar-based timescales are unlikely to contribute to the stability of the best timescales over the next decade, but they will remain a valuable independent check on atomic timescales. We also find that the stability of the pulsar-based timescale is likely to be limited by our knowledge of solar-system dynamics, and that errors in TT(BIPM17) will not be a limiting factor for the primary goal of the IPTA, which is to search for the signatures of nano-Hertz gravitational waves.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Ground-based measurements are from the CalNex Pasadena ground site, and airborne measurements took place onboard the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Navy Twin Otter and the NOAA WP-3D aircraft. BC predictions are in general agreement with observations at the Pasadena ground site and onboard the WP-3D, but are consistently overpredicted when compared to Twin Otter measurements. Adjustments to predicted inorganic mass concentrations, based on predicted aerosol size distributions and the AMS transmission efficiency, are shown to be significant. Owing to recent shipping emission reductions, the dominant source of sulfate in the L.A. Basin may now be long-range transport. Sensitivity studies suggest that severely underestimated ammonia emissions, and not the exclusion of crustal species (Ca2 +, K+, and Mg2 +), are the single largest contributor to measurement/model disagreement in the eastern part of the L.A. Basin. Despite overstated NOx emissions, total nitrate concentrations are underpredicted, which suggests a missing source of HNO 3 and/or overprediction of deposition rates. Adding gas-phase NH 3 measurements and size-resolved measurements, up to 10 μm, of nitrate and various cations (e.g. Na+, Ca2 +, K +) to routine monitoring stations in the L.A.

R.; Volt, F.; Wynn, R.; Lee, S. J.; Horowitz, M. M.; Gluckman, E.; Ruggeri, A.","Jul 2017","Background The standard for selecting unrelated umbilical cord blood units for transplantation for non-malignant diseases relies on antigen-level (lower resolution) HLA typing for HLA-A and HLA-B, and allele-level for HLA-DRB1. We aimed to study the effects of allele-level matching at a higher resolution—HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1, which is the standard used for adult unrelated volunteer donor transplantation for non-malignant diseases—for umbilical cord blood transplantation. Methods We retrospectively studied 1199 paediatric donor-recipient pairs with allele-level HLA matching who received a single unit umbilical cord blood transplantation for non-malignant diseases reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research or Eurocord and European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant. Transplantations occurred between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2012. The primary outcome was overall survival. The effect of HLA matching on survival was studied using a Cox regression model. Findings Compared with HLA-matched transplantations, mortality was higher with transplantations mismatched at two (hazard ratio [HR] 1·55, 95% CI 1·08–2·21, p=0·018), three (2·04, 1·44–2·89, p=0·0001), and four or more alleles (3·15, 2·16–4·58, p<0·0001). There were no significant differences in mortality between transplantations that were matched and mismatched at one allele (HR 1·18, 95% CI 0·80–1·72, p=0·39). Other factors associated with higher mortality included recipient cytomegalovirus seropositivity (HR 1·40, 95% CI 1·13–1·74, p=0·0020), reduced intensity compared with myeloablative conditioning regimens (HR 1·36, 1·10–1·68, p=0·0041), transplantation of units with total nucleated cell dose of more than 21 × 107 cells per kg compared with 21 × 107 cells per kg or less (HR 1·47, 1·11–1·95, p=0·0076), and transplantations done in 2000–05 compared with those done in 2006–12 (HR 1·64, 1·31–2·04, p<0·0001). The 5-year overall survival adjusted for recipient cytomegalovirus serostatus, conditioning regimen intensity, total nucleated cell dose, and transplantation period was 79% (95% CI 74–85) after HLA matched, 76% (71–81) after one allele mismatched, 70% (65–75) after two alleles mismatched, 62% (57–68) after three alleles mismatched, and 49% (41–57) after four or more alleles mismatched transplantations. Graft failure was the predominant cause of mortality. Interpretation These data support a change from current practice in that selection of unrelated umbilical cord blood units for transplantation for non-malignant diseases should consider allele-level HLA matching at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1.

The enactment of the National Defence Policy resulted in an increase in defence expenditure in Brazil that was primarily focused on developing and buying modern equipment and paying better salaries. The policy was implemented during three investment cycles that began with off-the-shelf acquisitions and moved to the execution of defence programmes aiming to develop indigenous technologies, substituting imports on the way. Despite the effort, we argue that the most likely scenario is that the achievement of the vision established in the National Defence Policy will be compromised, and that constant delays caused by the expenditure constraints might result in the delivery of outdated technologies and weapon systems, keeping a never-ending technological gap.","Navy","University of Manchester"

This paper uses the method of risk analysis to discuss defence procurement challenges in India. An original dataset of 88 contracts has been created to identify the most probable and the most severe causes for poor procurement performance. A schedule performance parameter has been constructed to quantify the impact of different adverse events. The findings display a high probability of technological risks followed by contractual risks as the cause for delays in Indian defence procurement. Technological risks are concentrated in cases of indigenous procurement, due to a lack of infrastructure and resources, while contractual risks mostly occur in contracts where the Ministry of Defence deals with external agents like foreign suppliers. This indicates frictions and transaction costs. These and other findings from the quantitative data on procurement performance are supplemented by insights from an extensive fieldwork in India which included 53 interviews.","Navy","University of Manchester"

It suspended the convertibility of the Bank of England's notes into gold, a policy that lasted until 1821. The current historical consensus is that it was a result of the state's need to finance the war, France’s remonetization, a loss of confidence in the English country banks, and a run on the Bank of England’s reserves following a landing of French troops in Wales. We argue that while these factors help us understand the timing of the suspension, they cannot explain its success. We deploy new long-term data that leads us to a complementary explanation: the policy succeeded thanks to the reputation of the Bank of England, achieved through a century of prudential collaboration between the Bank and the Treasury.","Navy","University of Manchester"

The two-stage cascade allows for increased separation selectivity whilst the integrated solvent recovery stage mitigates the otherwise large solvent consumption of the purification. This work explores the effect of washing the solvent recovery unit at intervals in order to attain high product purities with imperfect solvent recovery membranes possessing less than 100% rejection of the impurity. This operation attains a purity of 98.7% through semi-continuous operation with two washes of the solvent recovery stage, even when imperfect membranes are used in a closed-loop set-up. This contrasts favourably with the 83.0% maximum purity achievable in a similar set-up with a single continuous run. The process achieves slightly lower (−0.7%) yield of around 98.2% compared to a continuously operated process without solvent recovery but consumes approx. 85% less solvent (theoretical analysis suggests up to 96% reduction is possible). 9 different membranes, both commercial (GMT, Novamem, SolSep) and in-house fabricated, are screened and tested on a separation challenge associated with the synthesis of macrocycles – amongst the membrane materials are polyimide (PI), polybenzimidazole (PBI) and, polyetheretherketone (PEEK).","Navy","University of Manchester"

S.","15 Jul 2019","Between 1500 and 1800 CE, patterns of governance on the Korean peninsula shifted toward a dynamic that I term the “rise of the brokered state.” While central political authority increasingly became entrenched in a small number of elite families residing in the capital region, the reach of the Chosŏn state continued to grow through local institutions such as clerks and military garrisons. Likewise, avenues of interaction between Seoul and the provinces broadened thanks to the social and organizational consolidation of local elites. Over time, the government was able to utilize a widening assemblage of bureaucratic administration and local cooperation to expand state management of resources such as grain and timber. Previous scholarship has often situated Chosŏn center-local dynamics within vectors of conflict, stagnation, or progress. My analysis reframes Chosŏn administrative expansion as an interactive process through which a wide array of local yangban, clerks, military officials, and monks became key intermediaries between the central government and the provinces, in turn forming the infrastructural contours of the Chosŏn state itself.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Once the final colour is chosen, most of the problems associated with delivering the colour selected, under precise colour definition and control, at a reasonable cost, have been solved. Technical colour management is well served by accurate measurement and colour manipulation tools, and is founded on tried and tested science. By contrast, those managers whose responsibility it is to deliver successful colour selection, cannot appeal to much more than general principles, the dictates of fashion and intuition: they have very few tools and measurement techniques to assist them. Colour influences all aspects of our lives, from the clothes we wear and the food we eat to the environment in which we work [2]. The colour of an item of apparel worn by someone has an impact on how they are perceived by others and how they perceive themselves. This means that consumers are extremely sensitive to colour when choosing apparel goods. The rapid development of computers and information processing technology offers the prospect of bringing together hitherto fragmentary knowledge and precision colour technology in a concerted effort to improve the process of optimising product colour.

In recent years, research on the United Kingdom's population has placed greater emphasis on population movement in shaping Britain's story, identifying waves of migrants from elsewhere alongside migration within Britain. One neglected aspect of this narrative, however, is the migration of Scots to England, particularly in the age of the regal and parliamentary union, when the changing political relationship between the two kingdoms had an impact on the scale, geographic spread, and opportunities and obstacles of that migration. While a minority of Scottish migrants were unwelcome, or chose to return home, the overwhelming weight of evidence is for those migrants who remained in England. The focus in this article is on that majority group for whom migration was a positive experience, thus raising questions about why these Scots were so successful and why they faced so little native opposition. That process of segmented assimilation offers an insight into the formation of Britain and the shifting ground of national identity associated with the emerging British state. The Scots, moreover, provide a model for “successful” migration, suggesting that a range of factors—principally, an educated, culturally malleable, and economically responsive migrant population, alongside an institutionally and attitudinally flexible host community—need to be in place in order to optimize the chances of migrant assimilation","Navy","University of Manchester"

L.; Hodgson, D. M.; Brunt, R. L.; Peakall, J.; Hofstra, M.; Flint, S. S.","2018","Submarine channel-lobe transition zones separate well-defined channels from welldefined lobes and form morphologically complicated areas, commonly located at breaks in slope. These areas play a vital role in the transfer of sediment through deep-water systems. Extensive outcrop exposures in the Karoo Basin, South Africa, permit investigation of the depositional architecture and evolution of entirely exhumed dip transects of a channel-lobe transition zone for the first time. Furthermore, the excellent paleogeographic constraint allows correlation to genetically related updip channel-levee systems and downdip lobe deposits over 40 km, with strike control over 20 km. Unlike the single time slice afforded by modern systems, the Karoo example uniquely allows study of the temporal shifting of the channel-lobe transition zone and transfer into the stratigraphic record. Key lateral changes along the base of slope include the variation from an interfingering levee-lobe transition zone to a bypass-dominated channel-lobe transition zone over a width of 14 km. Key recognition criteria for channel-lobe transition zones in the ancient record include combinations of scours and megaflutes, composite erosional surfaces, mudstone clast/coarse-grained sediment lags, and remnants of depositional bed forms, such as sediment waves. Documented here in a single channel-lobe transition zone, these features are arranged in a zone of juxtaposed remnant erosional and depositional features. The zone reaches 6 km in length, formed by at least four stages of expansion/contraction or migration. Strike variations and changes in the dimensions of the channel-lobe transition zone through time are interpreted to be the result of physiographic changes and variations in flow dynamics across the base of slope. The dynamic nature of channellobe transition zones results in complicated and composite stratigraphy, with preservation potential generally low but increasing distally and laterally away from the mouth of the feeder channel system. Here, we present the first generic model to account for dynamic channel-lobe transition zone development, encompassing distinctive recognition criteria, fluctuations in the morphology and position of the zone, and the complex transfer into the sedimentary record.","Navy","University of Manchester"

K.","12 May 2021","Here we report the application of a mass spectrometry-based technology, imaging mass cytometry, to perform in-depth proteomic profiling of mitochondrial complexes in single neurons, using metal-conjugated antibodies to label post-mortem human midbrain sections. Mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly deficiency in complex I has previously been associated with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson’s disease. To further our understanding of the nature of this dysfunction, and to identify Parkinson’s disease specific changes, we validated a panel of antibodies targeting subunits of all five mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes in dopaminergic neurons from Parkinson’s disease, mitochondrial disease, and control cases. Detailed analysis of the expression profile of these proteins, highlighted heterogeneity between individuals. There is a widespread decrease in expression of all complexes in Parkinson’s neurons, although more severe in mitochondrial disease neurons, however, the combination of affected complexes varies between the two groups. We also provide evidence of a potential neuronal response to mitochondrial dysfunction through a compensatory increase in mitochondrial mass. This study highlights the use of imaging mass cytometry in the assessment and analysis of expression of oxidative phosphorylation proteins, revealing the complexity of deficiencies of these proteins within individual neurons which may contribute to and drive neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease.","Navy","University of Manchester"
"“Killing is our business and business is good”: The evolution of ‘war managerialism’ from body counts to counterinsurgency","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/killing-is-our-business-and-business-is-good-the-evolution-of-war","Mccann, L.","2017","Managerialism versus professionalism is a central axis of conflict across many occupations. ‘The profession of arms’ is no exception. This paper explores the contested yet symbiotic relationship of management and the military, via a discussion of the Vietnam conflict and contemporary debates over restructuring the U.S. military to fight so-called ‘New Wars’. It portrays a complex picture of the organization and measurement of destruction, arguing that managerialism has long been an important ideological element of civilian and military practice. While management systems such as the infamous ‘measurements of progress’ in the Vietnam War were practically dysfunctional they were effective up to a point in their managerialist goal of portraying civilian and military organizations as effective, evidence-based, progressive and ethical. This logic also pertains to contemporary debates over ‘progress’ and its measurement in the Iraq and Afghanistan counterinsurgencies and the campaign against Isil. Despite its practical limitations, managerialism is highly prevalent as ideology in warfare, fixating on tactical and operational levels thereby excluding broader strategic, political or ethical discussions. ‘Progress’ and its mismeasurement in Vietnam and the New Wars are therefore best understood not simply as reasons for military and civilian failures in prolonged and inconclusive conflicts, but as evidence of the success of managerialism in restricting public scrutiny and accountability of the business of war.","Navy","University of Manchester"

A.; Durkan, C.","2019","Fouling of oil-exposed surfaces remains a crucial issue due to the continued importance of oil as the world’s primary energy source. The key perpetrators in crude oil fouling have been identified as asphaltenes, a poorly-described mixture of diverse polyfunctional molecules that form part of the heaviest fractions of oil. Asphaltenes are responsible for a decrease in oil production and energy efficiency, and an increase in the risk of environmental hazards. Hence, understanding and managing systems that are prone to fouling is of great value but constitutes a challenge due to their complexity. In an effort to reduce that complexity, a study of a synthesised foulant of archipelago structure is presented. An alternative perspective on previously described solubility and aggregation mechanisms (eg. Critical Nanoaggrerate Concentration, Critical Clustering Concentration) is offered since the characterised system favours a continuous distribution of n-mers instead. A battery of experimental and modelling techniques have been employed to link the bulk and interfacial behaviour of a representative foulant monomer to effective fouling mitigation strategies. This systematic approach defines a new multiscale methodology in the investigation of fouling systems.","Navy","University of Manchester"

"“Grateful” Children and “Humanitarian” Marines: Georgette “Dickey” Chapelle’s Vietnam Photography, 1962","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/grateful-children-and-humanitarian-marines-georgette-dickey-chape","Vesma, G.","5 Jul 2021","This article explores how one female photographer, Georgette ‘Dickey’ Chapelle (1918–1965), used children’s emotions as visual and rhetorical justification for early ‘advisory’ actions in Vietnam by the United States, situating the presence of U.S. Marines in Vietnam as ‘humanitarian’. Children are a common subject for ‘humanitarian photography’, mobilising an emotional response and justifying certain actions as humanitarian (Fehrenbach and Rodogno, Humanitarian Photography: A History. Cambridge University Press, 2015). War photography studies have explored the creation of a ‘humanitarian soldier' to justify colonising conflicts in the twenty-first century (Parry, Media, Culture and Society 33 (8): 1185–1201, 2011; Kotilainen, “Humanitarian Soldiers, Colonialised Others and Invisible Enemies-Visual Strategic Communication Narratives of the Afghan War.” FIIA Working Paper, 2011). This paper brings these ideas to a case study from the Vietnam War era, emphasising the role of emotional constructions in the production of such ‘humanitarian’ interpretations of military activity. In her article for National Geographic, “Helicopter War in Viet Nam,” Chapelle focused on interactions between uniformed American men and Vietnamese children, whom she portrayed as grateful recipients of airlifts, clothing and medical treatment. Chapelle used children to symbolise South Vietnam, reflecting political discourses in the United States that presented Vietnam as a ‘childlike’ nation in need of ‘rescue’. While many photographs of children from the Vietnam War era were used as evidence of the moral indefensibility of the conflict, this paper argues that Chapelle’s photographs from the Mekong Delta in 1962 portray Vietnam as ‘childlike’ to justify American intervention in Vietnam as ‘humanitarian’.","Navy","University of Manchester"
"The stability of a flexible cantilever in viscous channel flow","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/the-stability-of-a-flexible-cantilever-in-viscous-channel-flow","Cisonni, J.; Lucey, A.; Elliott, N.; Heil, M.","2017","Most studies of the flow-induced flutter instability of a flexible cantilever have assumed inviscid flow because of the high flow speeds and the large scale of the structures encountered in the wide range of applications of this fluid–structure interaction (FSI) system. However, for instance, in the fields of energy harvesting and biomechanics, low flow speeds and small- and micro-scale systems can give relatively low Reynolds numbers so that fluid viscosity needs to be explicitly accounted for to provide reliable predictions of channel-immersed-cantilever stability. In this study, we employ a numerical model coupling the Navier–Stokes equations and a one-dimensional elastic beam model. We conduct a parametric investigation to determine the conditions leading to flutter instability of a slender flexible cantilever immersed in two-dimensional viscous channel flow for Reynolds numbers lower than 1000. The large set of numerical simulations carried out allows predictions of the influence of decreasing Reynolds numbers and of the cantilever confinement on the single-mode neutral stability of the FSI system and on the pre- and post-critical cantilever motion. This model's predictions are also compared to those of a FSI model containing a two-dimensional solid model in order to assess, primarily, the effect of the cantilever slenderness in the simulations. Results show that an increasing contribution of viscosity to the hydrodynamic forces significantly alters the instability boundaries. In general, a decrease in Reynolds number is predicted to produce a stabilisation of the FSI system, which is more pronounced for high fluid-to-solid mass ratios. For particular fluid-to-solid mass ratios, viscous effects can lower the critical velocity and lead to a change in the first unstable structural mode. However, at constant Reynolds number, the effects of viscosity on the system stability are diminished by the confinement of the cantilever, which strengthens the importance of flow inertia.","Navy","University of Manchester"

It identifies significant changes in a piece of machinery’s performance, which could be indicative of a developing fault and potentially lead to significant operational cost and even major disruption in manufacturing and production.Implementation of condition monitoring in a typical industrial environment requires support by a system of interconnected software and hardware elements. Traditionally, these systems were developed merely for the specific task of asset health monitoring. However, the digitalisation wave of Industry 4.0 and wider application of artificial intelligence-based (smart) technologies has provided a great opportunity for further development of these systems, thereby making substantial contributions to the efficiency of manufacturing and production.As a part of an Innovate UK-funded project, an intelligent condition monitoring system (called JANUS) was designed and developed in the R&D division of Monition Limited (now RS Components Limited) in order to contribute to operational efficiency, not only by means of reducing asset downtime via more accurate prediction of asset health condition but by more efficient use of technicians/labour resources. In order to meet these objectives, JANUS used machine learning and decision-making algorithms together to form an AI-DSS-based platform for analysis of condition monitoring data.","Ai","University of Manchester"

In considering AI diagnostics we suggest that explainability should be explicated as ‘effective contestability’. Taking a patient-centric approach we argue that patients should be able to contest the diagnoses of AI diagnostic systems, and that effective contestation of patient-relevant aspect of AI diagnoses requires the availability of different types of information about 1) the AI system's use of data, 2) the system's potential biases, 3) the system performance, and 4) the division of labour between the system and health care professionals. We justify and define thirteen specific informational requirements that follows from ‘contestability’. We further show not only that contestability is a weaker requirement than some of the proposed criteria of explainability, but also that it does not introduce poorly grounded double standards for AI and health care professionals’ diagnostics, and does not come at the cost of AI system performance. Finally, we briefly discuss whether the contestability requirements introduced here are domain-specific.","Ai","University of Manchester"

Arguments by tech firms that their AI systems are ethical, contextual, situated or fair, as well as APIs that are privacy-compliant and offer greater user control, are now commonplace. Yet, these justifications routinely disguise the organisational, and economic, reasons for the development of technical systems and features. The article considers how different forms of ‘technical critique’ are used by technical practitioners such as software engineers, applying Agre’s work on CTP, AI planning, grammars of action and empowerment to evaluate, and contextualise these justifications. As Agre understood, technical practitioners are not necessarily ‘a-critical’ or ‘uncritical’ in their approach to the design of technological systems or methods, but ordinarily compare the utility or performance of such according to a golden ethic: ‘does it work?’. Drawing on Agre’s studies of AI in the 1990s, the article considers how and what Agre considered to be the ‘Cartesian soul’ of AI research, on linguistic structuralism, and continues to frame much work within the wider tech industry today. Yet increasingly, as the article shows, ‘narrow’ and cynical forms of technical criticality are being used to legitimise, and publicise, corporate strategies of tech firms, whether through the development of AI systems by automotive start-ups such as Comma, or the management of relations with external developers through APIs, in the case of Facebook. Rather than judging the moral character of technical practitioners, however, the article offers an approach – via the work of Philip Agre – to examine how critical thinking is used, and often abused, within and beyond the tech industry.","Ai","University of Manchester"

We argue that the application of relevant artificial intelligence (AI) technology could help address this challenge. Employing interactively prompted narrative storytelling, we investigate the effectiveness of sentiment analysis (SA) on extracting valuable CE insights from primary qualitative data generated via chatbot interviews.Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on a granular and semantically clear framework we developed for studying CE feelings, an AI-augmented chatbot was designed. The chatbot interviewed a crowdsourced sample of consumers about their recalled service experience feelings. By combining free-text and closed-ended questions, we were able to compare extracted sentiment polarities against established measurement scales and empirically validate our novel approach.Findings – We demonstrate that SA can effectively extract CE feelings from primary chatbot data. Our findings also suggest that further enhancement in accuracy can be achieved via improvements in the interplay between the chatbot interviewer and SA extraction algorithms.Research limitations/implications – The proposed customer-centric approach can help service companies to study and better understand CE feelings in a cost-effective and scalable manner. The AI-augmented chatbots can also help companies foster immersive and engaging relationships with customers. Our study focuses on feelings, warranting further research on AI’s value in studying other CE elements.Originality/value – The unique inquisitive role of AI-infused chatbots in conducting interviews and analyzing data in realtime, offers considerable potential for studying CE and other subjective constructs.","Ai","University of Manchester"

Reward gaming occurs when the agent's reward function is mis-specified and the agent can achieve a high reward by altering or fooling, in some way, its sensors rather than by performing the desired actions. Our first heuristic tracks the rewards encountered in the environment and converts high rewards that fall outside the normal distribution into penalities. Our second heuristic relies on the existence of some validation action that an agent can take to check the reward. In this heuristic, on encountering an abnormally high reward, the agent performs a validation step before either accepting the reward as it is, or converting it into a penalty. We evaluate the performance of these heuristics on variants of the tomato watering problem from the AI Safety Gridworlds suite.","Ai","University of Manchester"

This is, however, a more complex issue and also depends on the mechanism by which a particular therapy alters HDL levels and on whether the capacity of HDL to perform its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative functions is restored. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of statins in which apo B and apo AI have been reported could provide valuable information. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Ai","University of Manchester"

"An AI automated self-organising, feature imitating approach for point cloud data reduction","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/an-ai-automated-self-organising-feature-imitating-approach-for-po","Soemantoro, R.; Omer, M.; Margetts, L.","14 Apr 2021","This paper presents a novel AI based self-organising data reduction technique which combines feature detection and topological learning to reduce the memory footprint of point cloud data in an adaptive way, reducing point density in featureless parts of the point cloud whilst maintaining sufficient points to preserve details of interest to the engineer. As a case study, this is applied to a 3D LiDAR scan of a masonry bridge with localised details such as anchors, cracks and patches of vegetation. The process comprises 4 stages: For each point, the distance to its neighbouring point is calculated using a nearest-neighbours search. Afterwards, 3D point cloud data is projected onto a 2D plane using principal component analysis. Next, the variables are mapped into the feature space where they are grouped using a clustering algorithm. Clusters correspond to specific physical features within the point cloud. Points within these clusters are assigned a feature weight that dictates their level of bias compared to points that do not belong to an engineering feature. Finally, a weighted self-organising map (SOM) algorithm is applied to learn the topology of the original point cloud, with a specific focus on feature points. This algorithm is a type of artificial neural network that uses competitive learning to generate an output map iteratively adjusted to represent the input. An advantage of the SOM is that the output map can be used to define the position of vertices in a finite element mesh. The results show that the standard SOM was able to reduce the data size by over 90%. However, such a reduction in data size risks loss of smaller engineering features. Upon application of a feature weight, the method was able to produce the same data reduction with up to 35% decrease in quantization error compared to a standard SOM. The research is of timely importance. It reduces the computational cost of point cloud visualisation and improves the reverse engineering process, enabling conversion of point clouds into CFD and FE meshes. The work will benefit academics, researchers and engineers in developing their models.","Ai","University of Manchester"

A.; Cordeiro, L. C.; Mavroeidis, V.","29 Jul 2023"," This paper presents the FormAI dataset, a large collection of 112,000 AI-generated compilable and independent C programs with vulnerability classification. We introduce a dynamic zero-shot prompting technique, constructed to spawn a diverse set of programs utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). The dataset is generated by GPT-3.5-turbo and comprises programs with varying levels of complexity. Some programs handle complicated tasks such as network management, table games, or encryption, while others deal with simpler tasks like string manipulation. Every program is labeled with the vulnerabilities found within the source code, indicating the type, line number, and vulnerable function name. This is accomplished by employing a formal verification method using the Efficient SMT-based Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC), which performs model checking, abstract interpretation, constraint programming, and satisfiability modulo theories, to reason over safety/security properties in programs. This approach definitively detects vulnerabilities and offers a formal model known as a counterexample, thus eliminating the possibility of generating false positive reports. This property of the dataset makes it suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of various static and dynamic analysis tools. Furthermore, we have associated the identified vulnerabilities with relevant Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) numbers. We make the source code available for the 112,000 programs, accompanied by a comprehensive list detailing the vulnerabilities detected in each individual program including location and function name, which makes the dataset ideal to train LLMs and machine learning algorithms.

"Trading off accuracy and explainability in AI decision-making: findings from 2 citizens’ juries","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/trading-off-accuracy-and-explainability-in-ai-decision-making-fin","van der Veer, S.; Riste, L.; Cheraghi-Sohi, S.; Phipps, D.; Tully, M.; Bozentko, K.; Atwood, S.; Hubbard, A.; Wiper, C.; Oswald, M.; Peek, N.","18 Sept 2021","OBJECTIVETo investigate how the general public trades off explainability versus accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and whether this differs between healthcare and non-healthcare scenarios.MATERIALS AND METHODSCitizens’ juries are a form of deliberative democracy eliciting informed judgment from a representative sample of the general public around policy questions. We organized two 5-day citizens’ juries in the UK with 18 jurors each. Jurors considered 3 AI systems with different levels of accuracy and explainability in 2 healthcare and 2 non-healthcare scenarios. Per scenario, jurors voted for their preferred system; votes were analyzed descriptively. Qualitative data on considerations behind their preferences included transcribed audio-recordings of plenary sessions, observational field notes, outputs from small group work and free-text comments accompanying jurors’ votes; qualitative data were analyzed thematically by scenario, per and across AI systems.RESULTSIn healthcare scenarios, jurors favored accuracy over explainability, whereas in non-healthcare contexts they either valued explainability equally to, or more than, accuracy. Jurors’ considerations in favor of accuracy regarded the impact of decisions on individuals and society, and the potential to increase efficiency of services. Reasons for emphasizing explainability included increased opportunities for individuals and society to learn and improve future prospects and enhanced ability for humans to identify and resolve system biases.CONCLUSIONCitizens may value explainability of AI systems in healthcare less than in non-healthcare domains and less than often assumed by professionals, especially when weighed against system accuracy. The public should therefore be actively consulted when developing policy on AI explainability.","Ai","University of Manchester"

M.; Jay, C.; Lennox, B.; Cangelosi, A.; Dennis, L.","31 May 2022","There is a growing interest in the use of robotics and AI in the nuclear industry, however it is important to ensure these systems are ethically grounded, trustworthy and safe. An emerging technique to address these concerns is the use of explainability. In this paper we present the results of an interview study with nuclear industry experts to explore the use of explainable intelligent systems within the field. We interviewed 16 participants with varying backgrounds of expertise, and presented two potential use cases for evaluation; a navigation scenario and a task scheduling scenario. Through an inductive thematic analysis we identified the aspects of a deployment that experts want to know from explainable systems and we outline how these associate with the folk conceptual theory of explanation, a framework in which people explain behaviours. We established that an intelligent system should explain its reasons for an action, its expectations of itself, changes in the environment that impact decision making, probabilities and the elements within them, safety implications and mitigation strategies, robot health and component failures during decision making in nuclear deployments. We determine that these factors could be explained with cause, reason, and enabling factor explanations.","Ai","University of Manchester"

We argue that AI should be utilised in the boardroom to address the current shortcomings in the corporate governance – corporate short-termism. AI can assist boards as they consider societal interests as it can process data in a manner and at a speed that is beyond the capability of manual systems. With well-designed algorithmic steps, AI can provide guidance that is independent of subjective judgements biased by shareholder short-termism and board opportunism. Company law should be revised to support AI-assisted corporate development by mitigating the legal risks of boards and by encouraging directors to use AI to achieve the ESG goals of the company.

The questionnaire included a scenario for participants to read and then respond to questions on the therapeutic alliance using questions based upon those asked on the working alliance short inventory scale. At the end of the questionnaire, there was also the opportunity for participants to respond to an open-ended question.FindingsIt is evident from the responses that there is a clear reservation about the use of AI technology within the therapeutic setting. In spite of this reticence, many participants recognised the potential and are open to the possibilities this technology can bring. It was notable that the therapists largest concern was about the potential to create a strong bond with a machine therapist.Originality/valueThis paper presents findings on therapists’ attitudes towards AI use within therapeutic practice and machine therapy.

In the USA, more COVID related deaths have been reported than the combined fatalities of the Pearl Harbor War and the September 11 terror attacks. COVID-19 itself is highly infectious and the speed at which it can mutate is rapid, leading to multiple varieties and strands of active coronaviruses, and rapid increases in the numbers of infected cases and deaths. The virus has infected more than 217 million of the population worldwide before the end of August 2021, yet in early March 2020, the total infected cases were still not reaching 100,000 (WHO, 2021).The global challenge has changed how we live, with social distancing measures and face masks mandates, and has shone a spotlight on our healthcare capabilities, highlighting shortages of medical resources and capacity, and raising issues of equitable access to vaccines and drugs. Governments of different countries have been challenged to deal with the crisis using limited resources and have emphasized different policies suiting their national strategies (Ecke, 2020; Ranney et al., 2020).Machine Learning, AI and Big Data research, scientists can offer recommendations, new discoveries and predictive methods in addressing both societal impact (Gupta et al., 2018) and medical services (van der Sommen et al., 2020). Big Data and cloud computing (Chang, 2014; Hosseinian-Far et al., 2018), the Internet of Things (Sicari et al., 2016), and Artificial Intelligence techniques (Vaishya et al., 2020) have significantly contributed to developing an understanding of the virus, identifying and developing treatments and managing and tracking the social and economic impact of the pandemic, and predicting trends (Tuli et al., 2020). Scientists can better understand the structure and weaknesses of virus variants through simulations offered by ML algorithms, leading to vaccine development with higher efficacy (Rotondo et al., 2021). Challenges addressed range from COVID-19 diagnosis and infection confirmation based on a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Kim et al., 2020) to privacy protection and secure transmission of messages among medical professionals (Wang et al., 2020).","Ai","University of Manchester"
"Reporting guideline for the early-stage clinical evaluation of decision support systems driven by artificial intelligence: DECIDE-AI","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/reporting-guideline-for-the-early-stage-clinical-evaluation-of-de","DECIDE-AI expert group","May 2022","A growing number of artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support systems are showing promising performance in preclinical, in silico evaluation, but few have yet demonstrated real benefit to patient care. Early-stage clinical evaluation is important to assess an AI system’s actual clinical performance at small scale, ensure its safety, evaluate the human factors surrounding its use and pave the way to further large-scale trials. However, the reporting of these early studies remains inadequate. The present statement provides a multi-stakeholder, consensus-based reporting guideline for the Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigations of DEcision support systems driven by Artificial Intelligence (DECIDE-AI). We conducted a two-round, modified Delphi process to collect and analyze expert opinion on the reporting of early clinical evaluation of AI systems. Experts were recruited from 20 pre-defined stakeholder categories. The final composition and wording of the guideline was determined at a virtual consensus meeting. The checklist and the Explanation & Elaboration (E&E) sections were refined based on feedback from a qualitative evaluation process. In total, 123 experts participated in the first round of Delphi, 138 in the second round, 16 in the consensus meeting and 16 in the qualitative evaluation. The DECIDE-AI reporting guideline comprises 17 AI-specific reporting items (made of 28 subitems) and ten generic reporting items, with an E&E paragraph provided for each. Through consultation and consensus with a range of stakeholders, we developed a guideline comprising key items that should be reported in early-stage clinical studies of AI-based decision support systems in healthcare. By providing an actionable checklist of minimal reporting items, the DECIDE-AI guideline will facilitate the appraisal of these studies and replicability of their findings.","Ai","University of Manchester"

The framework categorises data arising from a piece of research into this question, funded by the UK Association for Project Management, conducted with project managers and artificial intelligence experts. It was found that artificial intelligence presents both threat and opportunity for the status of project management and project managers in society and to the experience of project management for individual practitioners. Artificial intelligence has the potential to create new resources and capabilities to enhance the status of project management. However, the profession must identify its defensible traits against inevitable encroachment by AI if the occupation is to remain as a basis for valid status-claims in the lives of professional project managers. Project management is an occupation that has recently risen in prominence and acts as a good model of expert labour or the kinds of profession that have been created through the development of capitalistic organisation. Therefore, our analysis here has potential for application to a range of other types of professions in contemporary organisations that are facing the encroachment of artificial intelligence into their professional activities and the imitation of their traits.","Ai","University of Manchester"

A.","22 Jan 2023","Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming part of the everyday. During this transition, people’s intention to use AI technologies is still unclear and emotions such as fear are influencing it. In this paper, we focus on autonomous cars to first verify empirically the extent to which people fear AI and then examine the impact that fear has on their intention to use AI-driven vehicles. Our research is based on a systematic survey and it reveals that while individuals are largely afraid of cars that are driven by AI, they are nonetheless willing to adopt this technology as soon as possible. To explain this tension, we extend our analysis beyond just fear and show that people also believe that AI-driven cars will generate many individual, urban and global benefits. Subsequently, we employ our empirical findings as the foundations of a theoretical framework meant to illustrate the main factors that people ponder when they consider the use of AI tech. In addition to offering a comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of AI technology acceptance, this paper provides a nuanced understanding of the tension that exists between the fear and adoption of AI, capturing what exactly people fear and intend to do.","Ai","University of Manchester"
