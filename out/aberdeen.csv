"On the Latent Holes of VAEs for Text Generation","https://aura.abdn.ac.uk//handle/2164/18658","Li, Ruizhe; Peng, Xutan; Lin, Chenghua","July 2021","In this paper, we provide the first focused study on the discontinuities (aka. holes) in the latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), a phenomenon which has been shown to have a detrimental effect on model capacity. When investigating latent holes, existing works are exclusively centred around the encoder network and they merely explore the existence of holes. We tackle these limitations by proposing a highly efficient Tree-based Decoder-Centric (TDC) algorithm for latent hole identification, with a focal point on the text domain. In contrast to past studies, our approach pays attention to the decoder network, as a decoder has a direct impact on the model's output quality. Furthermore, we provide, for the first time, in-depth empirical analysis of the latent hole phenomenon, investigating several important aspects such as how the holes impact VAE algorithms' performance on text generation, and how the holes are distributed in the latent space.

However, there has been limited research on understanding how deep models in IQA work. This study introduces a novel positional masked transformer for IQA and provides insights into the contribution of different regions of an image towards its overall quality. Results indicate that half of an image may play a trivial role in determining image quality, while the other half is critical. This observation is extended to several other CNN-based IQA models, revealing that half of the image regions can significantly impact the overall image quality. To further enhance our understanding, three semantic measures (saliency, frequency, and objectness) were derived and found to have high correlation with the importance of image regions in IQA.

"The Inverse Problem for Argumentation Gradual Semantics","https://aura.abdn.ac.uk//handle/2164/21380","Oren, Nir; Yun, Bruno; Vesic, Srdjan; Baptista, Murilo","January 2022","Gradual semantics with abstract argumentation provide each argument with a score reflecting its acceptability, i.e. how ""much"" it is attacked by other arguments. Many different gradual semantics have been proposed in the literature, each following different principles and producing different argument rankings. A sub-class of such semantics, the so-called weighted semantics, takes, in addition to the graph structure, an initial set of weights over the arguments as input, with these weights affecting the resultant argument ranking. In this work, we consider the inverse problem over such weighted semantics. That is, given an argumentation framework and a desired argument ranking, we ask whether there exist initial weights such that a particular semantics produces the given ranking. The contribution of this paper are: (1) an algorithm to answer this problem, (2) a characterisation of the properties that a gradual semantics must satisfy for the algorithm to operate, and (3) an empirical evaluation of the proposed algorithm.

"Analytical Solutions for the Inverse Problem within Gradual Semantics","https://aura.abdn.ac.uk//handle/2164/19104","Oren, Nir; Yun, Bruno; Libman, Assaf; Baptista, Murilo","February 2022","Gradual semantics within abstract argumentation associate a numeric score with every argument in a system, which represents the level of acceptability of this argument, and from which a preference ordering over arguments can be derived. While some semantics operate over standard argumentation frameworks, many utilise a weighted framework, where a numeric initial weight is associated with each argument. Recent work has examined the inverse problem within gradual semantics. Rather than determining a preference ordering given an argumentation framework and a semantics, the inverse problem takes an argumentation framework, a gradual semantics, and a preference ordering as inputs, and identifies what weights are needed to over arguments in the framework to obtain the desired preference ordering. Existing work has attacked the inverse problem numerically, using a root finding algorithm (the bisection method) to identify appropriate initial weights. In this paper we demonstrate that for a class of gradual semantics, an analytical approach can be used to solve the inverse problem. Unlike the current state-of-the-art, such an analytic approach can rapidly find a solution, and is guaranteed to do so. In obtaining this result, we are able to prove several important properties which previous work had posed as conjectures.      ","Ai","University of Aberdeen"
