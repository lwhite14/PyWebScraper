"Drivers of thoroughness of NPD tool use in small high-tech firms","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Drivers-of-thoroughness-of-NPD-tool/9921863578201341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Paul Knott (External Author)","2019","This paper explores how thoroughly practitioners in small high-tech firms use tools in support of NPD activities. We present a mixed-methods study starting with a survey of 99 firms covering 76 tools across 12 functional perspectives on NPD, which shows wide variability in reported thoroughness of use. We investigate what drives this variability via 17 interviews. We find that the principal driver is institutional pressures that prioritise either rigorous process or pressure from targets. Based on these drivers and responses, we provide contingency-based advice as to how firms in different contexts can get the best results from using NPD tools.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"Posthumanism and Assistive Technologies: on the social inclusion/exclusion of low tech cyborgs","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Posthumanism-and-Assistive-Technologies-on-the/9921863512301341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Marcelo Buzato (External Author)","2019","In this paper, we elaborate on the consequences of a post-humanist perspective to the problem of physical disability by approaching the use of assistive technologies (AT) by disabled people as the introduction of a low-tech cyborg in the world. In doing so, we highlight examples of communication ATs and provide analogies between ATs and languages in the constitution of selves and social contexts. ATs are informed ideologically, so they can be seen both as a way to fix an impaired person, or as a strategy to overcome a physical and social context that disables some people and makes other people able-bodied. We argue that becoming a low- tech cyborg can be a form of social inclusion if we understand disability to be produced by the context, rather than as an inherent dysfunctionality of the individual. Based on this assumption, we identify two strategies of social inclusion of the low-tech cyborg: disembodiment of the Self, and embodied virtuality. We remark, however, that low-tech cyborgs can be configured out of necessity or choice and add that the same socioeconomic factors that produce inequality in general are also active in the social exclusion/inclusion of the low-tech cyborg. Thus, ATs can be adopted and transformed by choice so as to broaden the gap between cyborg haves and have nots, while both kinds of cyborgs can become increasingly subject to cognitive and affective exploitation in the context of cognitive capitalism. We conclude that the potential of a post-humanist perspective to disability should not be about making impaired humans integer, nor making integer humans more than human, but keeping selves ethically connected with others whether by virtual embodiment or embodied virtuality. Keywords: low-tech cyborgs; disability; social inclusion.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"Domain-specific NLP system to support learning path and curriculum design at tech universities","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Domain-specific-NLP-system-to-support-learning/9922160081401341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Nam Vu (RMIT Student Author); Bang Mach (RMIT Student Author); GuanDong Xu (External Author)","2022","The tech sector has been growing at a rapid speed, demanding a higher level of expertise from its labor force. New skills and programming languages are introduced and required by the industry every day, while the university courses are not updated adequately. Finding the high-demand skills and relevant courses to study has become essential to both students and faculty members at tech universities, which leads to a growing research interest in building an intelligence system to support decision making. Leveraging recent development in Natural Language Processing, we built an NLP-based course recommendation system specifically for the computer science (CS) and information technology (IT) fields. In particular, we built (1) a Named Entity Recognition (CSIT-NER) model to extract tech-related skills and entities, then used these skills to build (2) a personalized multi-level course recommendation system using a hybrid model (hybrid CSIT-CRS). Our CSIT-NER model, trained and fine-tuned on a large corpus of text extracted from StackOverflow and GitHub, can accurately extract the relevant skills and entities, outperforming state-of-the-art models across all evaluation metrics. Our hybrid CSIT-CRS can provide recommendations on multiple individualized levels of university courses, career paths with job listings, and industry-required with suitable online courses. The whole system received good ratings and feedback from users from our survey with 201 volunteers who are students and faculty members of tech universities in Australia and Vietnam. This research is beneficial to students, faculty members, universities in CS/IT higher education sector, and stakeholders in tech-related industries.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"When tech disrupts democracy: the institutionalisation of populist social movements during the transition to Techno-Feudalism","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/doctoral/When-tech-disrupts-democracy-the-institutionalisation/9921902011901341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Alexander Damien WATERS","2020","The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 ushered neoliberal capitalism into a prolonged hegemonic crisis. From Brexit, to Trump, from record inequality, to climate politics, the elites of the world-system are increasingly divided on what is to be done. A generalised crisis of legitimacy is thus affecting the world-system, whereby the people as a subject no longer believe as they once did and are no longer capable of acting accordingly. The Coronavirus Crash of 2020 heightened these contradictions dramatically, leading many to begin questioning whether neoliberalism will survive this latest crisis and what will replace it? Historical equivalents of such political-economic transitions suggest that a new social order will be built out of the ashes of the old. But if this is the case, why has a transition to a more progressive next system not occurred already? An eruption of mass movements has been observed globally since the financial crisis of 2008, yet after a month or a year, we hear little about what consequences these exhortations for popular sovereignty actualised. It is precisely within this space - between the several years of aftermath of a social movement's major mobilisations and political-economic transition - that this thesis seeks to make an original contribution to knowledge. The central research question animating this thesis is how have the consequences attributable to three left-populist movements in the wake of their major mobilisations in 2015-2017 shaped the emergent transition to what comes after neoliberalism and what strategy for the institutionalisation of their goals has been the most effective over the medium term? In response, my overall argument is that, as a result of both the external structural barriers and internal collective-agential choices facing the three movements, the Climate Justice Movement in Australia, the Podemos Movement-Party in Spain and the Black Lives Matter Movement in the US, they have each struggled to guide the transition beyond neoliberalism in the direction of a more democratic, just, and sustainable system. I identify the three movement's strategies, respectively, as co-optive institutionalisation (similar to NGO-isation), disruptive institutionalisation (sometimes referred to in the literature as 'from protest to politics') and disruptive non-institutionalisation (effectively indefinite protest and a refusal to develop into any formal organisation over time). Instead of a single revolutionary moment of rupture, the most likely transition, which I argue we have begun living through with the Coronavirus Crash of 2020, is a slow decay from the neoliberal model of capitalism into 'techno-feudalism'. I argue that this represents a new mode of production which can summarily be defined as a return to some characteristics of pre-capitalist class society, and the instrumentalisation of technology for social control. As Wolfgang Streeck's How Will Capitalism End? noted (2016, p. 28 drawing on Winters 2011) present levels of wealth inequality between the richest 400 Americans and the rest of the American population are comparable to that seen at the height of the Roman empire between a senator and a slave. The emergence of techno-feudalism can be observed in a new rentier-based economy dominated by a handful of platform economy corporations wherein the rapid flows of intangible capital and immaterial labour are determined by oligarchs who control - not so much the physical infrastructure of mines, factories and shops as the dominant class did under capitalism - but rather the crucial vectors of information exchange which figures such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook have used to become among the wealthiest and influential human beings in history. Techno-feudalism is distinct from capitalism in that it features a new class structure of Techno-Rentier Oligarchs who own the giant platform corporations and a popular class which lives under the dictatorship of the algorithm who have been made increasingly precarious by automation and global labour market competition which I call the Techno-Precariat Commoners. Rather than at the point of production only, as per class struggle under industrial capitalism, under techno-feudalism the elite seeks to everywhere create regimes of New Enclosure by controlling, monopolising, privatising and then militarising all societal resources from public space to creative media shared over the internet. New state functions render the social contract of liberal democratic capitalism void since political and economic power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of this oligarchy and the state repressive apparatus (policing, prisons, intelligence agencies and so on) grows more sophisticated by the year. Cast against this dystopian spectre of technology for social control, the popular class of the Techno-Precariat Commoners employ the social movement strategy of commoning to create New Commons systems of open access and democratically negotiated management. Remunicipalisation movements provide a model for reversing the privatisation of city-scale utilities like water, electricity, gas, public transport and other services. The thesis is shaped by a post-Marxist theoretical framework driven by the ideas of Paolo Gerbaudo, Laurence Cox, Guy Standing, Chantal Mouffe, Nick Srnicek, and Andre Gorz. Within a political economy framework influenced by their ideas, the consequences of the three movements are analysed in relation to mass culture, institutions and policy. Having established that these movements are confronted with a new form of political economy in techno-feudalism, I argue that this is the meta-reason it is so difficult for social movements to have a major impact on society today. Techno-feudalism has created a steeper terrain of struggle in which political opportunity structural barriers have made pursuing the political goals of left-populist movements objectively more difficult than under conditions of neoliberalism, social democracy or early capitalist expansion. Mass surveillance, the capacity for hyper-targeted repression and spectacular algorithmic forms of distraction are new challenges to which social movements will have to adapt and overcome. This does not amount to a call for defeatism. History is simultaneously moving forwards technologically while at the same time it is being driven backwards politically. Technology can provide the illusion that progress happens by default. But when progressive social movements and parties retreat, history does not move forward, nor does it stand still, patiently waiting. Regressive movements, parties and oligarchs have their own visions for what kind of system should replace neoliberal capitalism and it is this revanchist revolutionary subject that has stepped in to fill the void.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

"Redirecting surveillance capitalism: Facebook and Australia’s news media bargaining code","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Redirecting-surveillance-capitalism-Facebook-and-Australias/9922211561601341?institution=61RMIT_INST","None","2022","Facebook’s response to the draft News Media Bargaining Code (the Code) proposed by Australia’s Morrison government in February 2021 made digital and corporate history. The Silicon Valley behemoth, with an operating rationale to manipulate and commodify human relations for profit, decided to make an example of a sovereign country. It did so by barring, blanking and scraping information broadly defined as news content from the pages of Australian organisations and entities hosted on the company’s site. Along with Google, Facebook reasoned that the Code imposed an ill-conceived arbitration model to determine revenue for news organisations using their platforms. News organisations, hoping to recoup classified and ad revenue lost to the platforms, argued for greater bargaining powers in negotiating with Facebook and Google.

The Code is underpinned by erroneous assumptions regarding market practices pertaining to digital platforms, entrenching the very problems it claims to address. The developments suggested ‘the curious role of the bargaining code: it’s meant to operate as a legislative threat so arbitration only happens when platforms and news outlets can’t agree. If Google keeps handing out money, this is unlikely to happen’ (Meese, 2021). With agreed government amendments made to the Code on Facebook’s ‘refriending’ of Australia (Frydenberg, 2021), two victorious parties emerged: the digital platforms and old news media.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

It postulates that by incorporating incertitude as a productive and constructive component in alternative computation-driven design and materialisation methods (rather than as negatives), the locally available solution space for built architecture can be dramatically expanded and onsite ability and agency increased.<br /><br />The study develops a methodology that aims at procedurally managing serious slippage from aleatory occurrences during materialisation and transforming it into a practical opportunity for non-standard project realisation. In doing so the case is made for the use of more democratic epistemic models and more intelligent structures of approximation than (common) deterministic approaches in digital design would allow for.<br /><br />The field of study is &lsquo;Post-Digital Architectural Design Practice,&rsquo; which is characterised by virtually unlimited computational ability, precision and unprecedented access to specialised and complex processes, wherein the challenge lies in the translation of its expanded agency into professional application. The employed methodologies are &lsquo;Participatory Action Research&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reflective Practice,&rsquo; applied on an existing and developing body of creative works of increasing scale and complexity, built in volatile construction contexts. Their study identifies and challenges preconceived notions behind their creation and frames these in dialectic space for further development until higher-order knowledge is extracted in contribution to the overall field of study.<br /><br />The demonstrator employs protean design diagrams capable of absorbing serendipity throughout the project crystallisation process. Named &lsquo;vibrant objectiles,&rsquo; these diagrams consist of holistic, computation-driven, associative design models that are procedural in nature and cover both project design and delivery. They are built from a select number of interdependent components that are optimised for local implementation. These are placed in and communicate across a hierarchy of scale and impact, enabling the emergence of larger-scale complexity. They relate to aspects of project materiality, material system and/or materialisation, and can incorporate site-specific idiosyncrasies. They have potentially high levels of volatility or uncertainty, termed &lsquo;vibrancy&rsquo;. This vibrancy is managed throughout the project development, rather than locked down. From early on, the extensibility of potential deviations is harnessed within the developing objectile that incorporates continuous feedback from rigorous prototyping. Until project completion, uncertainty is given room to feed back into the system, giving rigour and animus to the whole. Hence, rather than seeing the act of design materialisation as the literal translation of digitally designed objects, the proposed method embraces fluctuations as the design develops into its final singular site-specific solution.<br /><br />Evaluation of the potential and efficacy of the proposed method challenges the role practising architects are often given and the extent of their authority within professional legal frameworks. For the proposed method to successfully bridge the dissociation between theory and practice, the architects&rsquo; mode of operation needs to change, and the extent of their actions to dramatically expand. However, once these changes are made possible, the discussed projects demonstrate that the increase of local onsite affordance can be substantial.<br />","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Individuals do not have uniform access to lawyers, courts and remedies – with the most vulnerable individuals generally having the least and worst access.

Although there is no generally accepted definition of ODR, it includes use of the Internet to prevent and/or resolve disputes. This means that ODR includes online problem diagnosis and self-help tools, as well as technologies to promote online negotiation, mediation, arbitration, community courts, and variations thereof. Nonetheless, ODR comes with perils and it is necessary to revamp research regarding ODR to promote A2J. This article will discuss ideas regarding ODR regulation and research – again with a goal toward expanding A2J.

A significant proportion of fresh fruit globally is grown by developing countries in tropical regions, especially in Asia, and exported to other countries. This has become an important source of economic income for many developing countries, such as Thailand. Nevertheless, the fresh fruit industry in developing countries is experiencing critical issues, including short shelf life, high wastage, poor quality, and food safety, due to operations in high-temperature environment. Studies reveal that many developed countries have successfully solved these problems by using a cold supply chain with tight temperature control throughout the entire supply chain process. Cold supply chain adoption usually requires heavy investment in infrastructure and technology, as well as technical knowledge training for operational staff to ensure temperature compliance along the supply chain. In developing countries where capital resources are limited, this so-called high-tech high-cost approach has proven to be an obstacle to widespread cold supply chain adoption. As such, the design adopted by developed countries to implement a fresh fruit cold supply chain might not be directly applicable to developing countries, due to the lack of cold chain infrastructure and equipment and the low level of technical know-how. To address this issue, this study presents a proposal for adopting a low-tech low-cost approach by focusing more on available resources, such as cheap labour, and flexibility in work practices such as work shifts, than on infrastructure and technology in designing cold chain systems for developing countries. It is considered that this option would be more viable for developing countries with limited capital resources and know-how, and would thus enable widespread cold supply chain adoption. It could also play a vital role in the transition of cold supply chain implementation from a nascent stage to a mature development, whereby the high-tech high-cost approach of the developed countries would more readily be adopted. This study incorporates insights from multiple theoretical perspectives, including the theory of constraint (TOC) and network theory (NT), to underpin the low-tech low-cost approach proposed. Two alternative low-tech cold supply chain designs are investigated and developed based upon a comprehensive literature review of the state of the art in the field. Owing to the fact that fresh fruit cold chain adoption is still relatively rare in developing countries, this study explores different approaches to low-tech cold supply chain design for fresh fruits using simulation as a tool. A traditional fresh mango supply chain in Thailand, which involves five farms, three processors, one transporter and one middleman company, was used as a case study to facilitate the exploration. Discrete-event simulation was employed to evaluate the changes in performance of the typical mango supply chain before and after the adoption of the cold supply chain design. Key performance indicators, such as lead time, total operating cost, shelf life, wastage, and throughput, of the current supply chain and the different cold chain designs were compared. The findings reveal that cold supply chain design using the low-tech low-cost approach performs better in all aspects than the other design relying solely on infrastructure investment. Scenario tests also show that such a design is more robust than the other infrastructure-oriented design when facing fluctuations in demand and increases in labour cost in the long run. By proposing an innovative approach to cold chain design for developing countries and exploring its feasibility using computer simiultaion, this study makes a significant contribution to practice by showing the potential benefits of a low-tech low-cost approach to cold chain adoption in developing countries, thereby expeditng its implementation. It also contributes to knowledge by creating a new scope for research in cold chain design leveraging labour resource, change in work practices, and collaboration instead of merely infrastructure and technology.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

This article provides a comparative study of Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, some of the earliest countries in the world to engage in these policy processes. The study reveals that these media systems have devised similar regulatory tools and their approach aligns with a more disaggregated set of reforms occurring across Europe. While these reform agendas often draw on valuable concepts from media policy, they also awkwardly translate frameworks and introduce already questionable regulatory approaches to the platform environment. The most notable is the ongoing focus on stakeholders instead of the wider public interest. I end the paper by arguing the long-term sustainability of journalism need to be decoupled from attempts to limit platform power. I outline a more targeted regulatory response focussed on antitrust and privacy and note that journalism will receive downstream benefits from these efforts. The approach challenges the core issues associated with platform dominance and stands in contrast to current reform proposals, which threaten to hamper much needed institutional transformation across the journalism sector.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"Antibacterial peptides from marine bacillus species","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Antibacterial-peptides-from-marine-bacillus-species/9921893509501341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Khanh Minh CHAU","2020","The indiscriminate use of antibiotics in healthcare and agriculture over the past decades has led to a high incidence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens worldwide. One of the solutions that could be considered to combat this crisis is the identification of novel antibiotics or other alternatives. However, the discovery pipeline for novel antimicrobials, identified from organisms in the terrestrial environment, is sparse. Therefore, we have taken an alternative approach to this issue by screening marine bacteria to seek novel bacteriocins for further antibiotic development. Bacteriocins are a family of ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides; some of which are currently applied as safe food preservatives (nisin) and they are also gaining interest as promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. The Vietnam Sea has a variety of marine ecosystems with diverse marine species, but there has been little exploration of this source for novel active compounds. Therefore, we undertook a discovery program aimed at identifying novel bacteriocins from bacterial isolates recovered from the Vietnam Sea.
</br> 
In stage one, 64 spore-forming bacterial isolates that exhibited antimicrobial activity were identified after sampling and bacterial isolation (Chapter 3). Inspection of their antimicrobial spectra resulted in the short-listing of 23 isolates for further analysis. Based on 16S ribosomal RNA sequences, these 23 isolates were identified as 22 Bacillus species and 1 Paenibacillus species (Paenibacillus polymyxa), including ubiquitous species (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens), and floral species (Bacillus halotolerans, Bacillus safensis, Bacillus pacificus, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Bacillus licheniformis). They exhibited strong antibacterial activity against a range of human and veterinary pathogens and food-poisoning bacteria with dominance of proteinaceous antimicrobial substances. Inspection of the breadth and strength of antimicrobial activities informed the selection of 6 isolates for whole genome sequencing in the second stage of the study.
</br> 
The six isolates subjected to whole genome sequencing were; four B. amyloliquefaciens isolates (#06, #08, #11, #13), one B. halotolerans (#01) isolate, and one P. polymyxa (#23) isolate (Chapter 4). Bioinformatic analysis identified genes encoding 61 putative antimicrobial peptides within the genomes of the six isolates, including 41 mostly characterised non-ribosomally synthesized peptides (lipopeptides, polyketides and bacilysin) and 20 bacteriocins. Amongst the 20 putative bacteriocins found, there were 13 different types of bacteriocins. The putative bacteriocin encoding genes clusters included those for 6 characterised bacteriocins (mersacidin, paenicidin A, plantazolicin, LCI, amylocyclicin, subtilosin A), and 7 uncharacterised/ unique bacteriocins (2 thiopeptides, 1 two-component lantibiotic, 1 sactipeptide, 2 lantibiotic, and 1 lassopeptide). 
</br> 
In the third stage of the study (Chapters 5 and 6); two isolates were selected for antimicrobial purification. Purification of antimicrobial peptides from isolate #11 resulted in the identification of amylocyclicin ([m/z]= 6,381), iturin/surfactin ([m/z]= 1,058) and an undefined peptide ([m/z]= 1,473). The undefined peptide ([m/z]= 1,473), was suspected to be a novel thiopeptide due to the similarity of MW. However, the amino acid sequence of this peptide couldn¿t be elucidated by an N-terminal sequencing method. Antimicrobial purification from isolate #23 identified polymyxin ([m/z]= 1168.7), tridecaptin ([m/z]= 1550.8), and paenicidin A ([m/z]= 3290.4), but no novel bacteriocins. 
</br> 
In the fourth stage of the study, an attempt was made to heterologously produce the novel sactipeptide which was one of three putative novel bacteriocins predicted from the genome of isolate #23. The technique employed E. coli/B. subtilis shuttle plasmid, pDLL202, for plasmid construction and a heterologous B. subtilis host for bacteriocin expression. A 15,487 bp fusion plasmid (pDLL202/G23sac) was constructed, carrying an 8,556 bp¿sactipeptide gene cluster derived from isolate #23 and the 6,938 bp- plasmid backbone derived from plasmid pDL202. The Bacilllus transformants successfully expressed the sactipeptide. The sactipeptide had a molecular weight (MW) of 3,404 Da and depressed growth of Gram-positive bacteria. 
Taken together, the marine Bacillus/Paenibacillus are abundant reservoirs of genes coding novel bacteriocins for further discovery. These antimicrobial compounds produced by marine Bacillus/Paenibacillus can be developed into therapeutic antimicrobial drugs against antibiotic-resistant pathogens, particularly against antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

The MPA is divided into two spatially separated zones based on habitat type: a seagrass zone and a coral reef zone. In this study, visual census data were collected in 2018–2019 and were used to derive fish biomass and community diversity metrics as proxies for ecosystem condition and function (trophic and mobility). The effectiveness of the MPA in protecting fish communities in the seagrass and coral reef zones was evaluated. An updated characterization of the Phu Quoc fish communities, and an assessment of fish community variation among regions and between habitat types, is provided. In total, 125 species representing 74 genera of 40 families were recorded. Omnivores were the most abundant (38%), followed by planktivores (24%), whereas piscivores (2%) were scarce. There was an especially low density of high-value fishery target species such as Haemulidae (<0.01%), Carangidae (<0.2%), Lethrinidae (<0.3%), Lutjanidae (<0.4%), Serranidae (<2%), and Chaetodontidae (<3%). Alarmingly, fishes with a total length of >20 cm only accounted for 1% of the total individuals. Species and functional composition were similar between protected and unprotected areas but differed among regions and between habitats. These results suggest that the protection of fishes provided by Phu Quoc MPA at the time of this study was ineffective. The taxonomic composition of fish communities has remained relatively unchanged over the last approximately 25 years, with the density of large fishes and commercial species remaining low. There is capacity to improve MPA performance by providing adequate resources for threat management and using evidence-based decision-making in management. The 2020 rezoning and expansion of the Phu Quoc MPA is discussed with regards to prioritizing biodiversity and coverage targets.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an emerging tool for pest surveillance, allowing for the detection of genetic material shed by organisms into the environment. However, factors influencing the spatial and temporal detection limits of eDNA in marine environments are poorly understood. In this study we use eDNA assays to assess the invasive ranges of two marine pests in south-eastern Australia, the kelp Undaria pinnatifida and the seastar Asterias amurensis. We explored the temporal and spatial detection limits of eDNA under different oceanographic conditions by combining estimates of eDNA decay with biophysical modelling. Positive eDNA detections at several new locations indicate the invasive range of both pest species is likely to be wider than currently assumed. Environmental DNA decay rates were similar for both species, with a decay rate constant of 0.035 h−1 for U. pinnatifida, and a decay rate constant of 0.041 h−1 for A. amurensis, resulting in a 57–73% decrease in eDNA concentrations in the first 24 h and decaying beyond the limits of detection after 3–4 days. Biophysical models informed by eDNA decay profiles indicate passive transport of eDNA up to a maximum of 10 to 20 km from its source, with an ~90–95% reduction in eDNA concentration within 1–3 km from the source, depending on local oceanography. These models suggest eDNA signals are likely to be highly localised, even in complex marine environments. This was confirmed with spatially replicated eDNA sampling around an established U. pinnatifida population indicating detection limits of ~750 m from the source. This study highlights the value of eDNA methods for marine pest surveillance and provides a much-needed description of the spatio-temporal detection limits of eDNA under different oceanographic conditions.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

The diverse microbial communities that inhabit these ecosystems are believed to influence large-scale geochemical processes and, as such, analyzing their composition and functional metabolism can be a means to assessing an ecosystems resilience to physical and chemical perturbations, or at the very least provide baseline information and insight into future research needs. Here we show the utilization of organic and inorganic contaminant screening coupled with metabolomics and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess the microbial community structure of marine sediments and their functional metabolic output. The sediments collected from Moreton Bay (Queensland, Australia) contained low levels of organic and inorganic contaminants, typically below guideline levels. The sequencing dataset suggest that sulfur and nitrite reduction, dehalogenation, ammonia oxidation, and xylan degradation were the major metabolic functions. The community metabolites suggest a level of functional homogeneity down the 40-cm core depth sampled, with sediment habitat identified as a significant driver for metabolic differences. The communities present in river and sandy channel samples were found to be the most active, with the river habitats likely to be dominated by photoheterotrophs that utilized carbohydrates, fatty acids and alcohols as well as reduce nitrates to release atmospheric nitrogen and oxidize sulfur. Bioturbated mud habitats showed overlapping faunal activity between riverine and sandy ecosystems. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria and lignin-degrading bacteria were most abundant in the sandy channel and bioturbated mud, respectively.

Using geogrid layers to enhance the strength and stability of embankments is regarded as a commendable stabilization method.

Therefore, the aim of this research is to study effects of groundwater level changes on the stability of a geogrid-reinforced-slope on loose marine soils in the Qeshm Island, Iran. At first, geotechnical properties of the site were obtained by a comprehensive series of geotechnical laboratory and in-situ tests. Then, by simultaneous changes of groundwater level and several parameters such as embankment slope, loading, geogrid layer length, geogrid layer number, and tensile strength of geogrid layers, different characteristics such as embankment safety factor (SF), vertical and horizontal displacements at embankment top and embankment base were studied. It is observed that groundwater level has significant effects on the behavior of the embankment. For most of the observations, by decreasing the groundwater level, the displacements decreased and consequently safety factor increases. Increasing the length, number, and tensile strength of geogrid led to the reduction of the displacements and the increment of the safety factor.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Because marine biofouling can interfere with the performance of such applications and plays an important role in species dispersal, there is a need to understand biofouling dynamics on the materials used. This study compared biofouling on common 3D-printing polymers printed by common methods - polycaprolactone (PCL) printed by fused deposition modelling, VisiJet® SL Clear printed by stereolithography, and VeroClear™ printed by PolyJet, as well as the comparison materials polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, used in many experimental biofouling studies) and glass - and related fouling to material properties. Bacterial assemblages in 2- and 4-week old biofilms were similar on all materials, dominated by cyanobacteria and proteobacteria. The extent of macrofouling after 12 weeks differed significantly among materials, with the greatest coverage on glass (98.4%) and the least on PCL (86.8%). Macrofouler assemblages differed significantly, with 3D-printing polymers generally having less microalgae and more encrusting bryozoans than PDMS and glass. PCL was the most extreme of the 3D-printing materials in having the least microalgae and most bryozoans (arborescent and encrusting combined). Macrofouling coverage was not significantly related to material hydrophobicity, elastic modulus, hardness, or roughness. In contrast, macrofouler assemblage structure had a statistically significant relationship to hardness and a marginally significant relationship to hydrophobicity (explaining 19.0% and 8.6% of the variation in the assemblages, respectively). The reduced biofouling coverage and altered species composition on PCL may be advantageous for using PCL in marine applications of 3D printing, although other factors should be considered such as material degradation over time.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

An increase in temperature and extreme events may enhance the release, degradation, transportation, and mobilization of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic pollutants in the estuarine and marine environments. Based on the available pollutants' toxicity trend data and information it reveals that the toxicity of several high-risk pollutants may increase with increasing levels of climate change stressors. It is likely that the interactive effects of climate change and pollutants may enhance the bioaccumulation of pollutants in seafood organisms.

These polymers enter the waterways, migrate, breakdown; albeit slowly, and then interact with the environment and the surrounding biodiversity. It is these biodiversity and ecosystem interactions that are causing the most nervousness, where health researchers have demonstrated that plastics have entered the human food chain, also showing that plastics are damaging organisms, animals, and plants. Many researchers have focused on reviewing the macro and micro-forms of these polymer contaminants, demonstrating a lack of scientific data and also a lack of investigation regarding nano-sized polymers. It is these nano-polymers that have the greatest potential to cause the most harm to our oceans, waterways, and wildlife. This review has been especially ruthless in discussing nano-sized polymers, their ability to interact with organisms, and the potential for these nano-polymers to cause environmental damage in the marine environment.

Compared to the OPC-M, higher values of diffusion coefficient and lower values of chloride binding capacity were obtained for the SGPC-M concrete. Besides, the study on the pore characteristics and absorption behaviour of the concrete indicates that the SGPC-M possesses more pores than the OPC-M, which is related to the lower resistance to chloride penetration in the marine environment.

For optimal healing, the inflammatory, proliferative and remodelling phases of repair must occur in the correct sequence with appropriate stimuli to prevent insufficient or excessive activity at critical stages. The inflammatory and proliferative phases of repair can influence both the rate of wound resolution and the skin physiology of newly resolved tissue and subsequent remodelling. Optimisation of these processes has the potential to both enhance closure rate and minimise microorganism colonisation, reduce scarring and enhance wound tensile strength. There are many local and systemic factors that can severely impede healing and promote wound progression from an acute to a chronic state. This is particularly evident in the elderly whom are prone to various comorbidities that can influence the immune, circulatory and respiratory systems and often rely on medical intervention to assist healing.<br /><br />In recent decades the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of marine natural products (MNPs) have attained global attention due to their potential implications for human health. Omega-3 fatty acid enriched oils (carbon dioxide and dimethyl ether extracted oils; CO2 and DME oil) extracted from the New Zealand green lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, have demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory properties. 5&beta;-scymnol, a shark bile sterol, is another MNP with beneficial health implications due to its potent antioxidant abilities. However, the wound healing potential of these MNPs remains broadly unknown. In this study, the effects of these three MNPs on the inflammatory and proliferative phase of repair were explored in vitro. Results indicated that the two marine oils demonstrated inhibition of the pro-inflammatory metabolites of the 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways in a dose-dependent manner, but did not stimulate keratinocyte or fibroblast growth. Similarly, 5&beta;-scymnol displayed no effect on the growth of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, but was also shown to inhibit cyclooxygenase metabolite production. <br /><br />Of equal interest is the recent application of natural and synthetic biomaterials in tissue engineering and wound healing. Wound healing products containing nano-silver &ndash; primarily used for its antimicrobial properties &ndash; are currently utilised for wound management. However, other metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs), including zinc oxide (ZnO), have not been sufficiently tested for their ability to aid healing. In the second arm of this study, the effects of the ZnO NPs were similarly assessed in vitro. The ZnO NPs significantly enhanced scratch closure in human keratinocyte monolayer cultures in a dose- and particle size-dependent manner, while larger ZnO particulates were less effective. Furthermore, examination of surfactant-dispersed ZnO NPs revealed that the agglomeration state of the material was an important characteristic. Additionally, titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs similarly enhanced keratinocyte re-epithelialisation, while fibroblasts were unaffected by nanomaterial exposure. These results suggest that the observed scratch closure enhancement effects were dependent on agglomerate size and cell type, and may not be nanomaterial specific. Furthermore, ZnO exhibited 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase modulating activity.<br /><br />The effects of ZnO NPs were further examined in an in vivo model of wound repair as these were the most potent in the in vitro test systems. Nanoparticulate ZnO was directly compared to its surfactant-dispersed equivalent, bulk ZnO particulate and the TiO2 NP, after application to skin biopsy punch wounds on the shaved backs of C57BL/6 female mice. Enhanced wound healing was evident in undispersed ZnO NP-treated wounds only. Histology of skin wounds at day 7 revealed a markedly reduced epidermal thickness and decreased cytokeratin-14 and Ki-67 expression in ZnO NP-treated wounds compared to saline-only controls. A reduced proportion of type-III to type-I collagen was also evident in the dermis of ZnO NP-treated wounds. However, no differences were seen in the amount of immune cell infiltrate or angiogenesis. ZnO NP-treated wounds showed more-ordered healing and were further along the healing process at day 7 compared to untreated controls. However, by day 14 no differences were detectable between ZnO NP treatment and controls in fully-healed skin. These results suggest that ZnO NP-treated wounds heal at an accelerated rate, and in a more organised fashion.<br /><br />Taken together, these findings show that MNPs and NPs show potential for modulating both the inflammatory response and the rate of epidermal cell re-epithelialisation in healing wounds, both of which are rate-limiting factors for efficient repair of human skin.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Textures were almost exclusively a single layer of regularly arranged geometric features rather than complex hierarchical or irregular designs. Textures in general had no effect or an inconclusive effect on fouling in 46% of cases. However, effective textures more often decreased (35%) rather than increased (19%) fouling. Complex designs were more effective against fouling (51%) than were regular geometric features (32%). Ratios of feature height, width, or pitch to organism body length were significant influences. The authors recommend further research on promising complex and hierarchical texture designs with more test species, as well as field studies to ground-truth laboratory results.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

A computational fluid dynamics investigation based on the lattice Boltzmann method illustrated that the branches of the optimized configuration could shield polyps from ocean currents and afford sufficient nutrition. Eventually, we prototyped samples by digital light processing printer with an optimum mixture ratio of biologically compatible calcium carbonate and photosensitive material. Examples show the tropism of marine organisms in human-made corals is akin to the natural ones.

Plastic has been found in all parts of the marine environment, including the surface layers of the ocean, within the water column, in coastal waters, on the benthic layer and on beaches. While research on detecting MPD using remote sensing is increasing, most of it focuses on detecting floating debris in open waters, rather than detecting MPD on beaches. However, beaches present challenges that are unique from other parts of the marine environment. In order to better understand the spectral properties of beached MPD, we present the SWIR reflectance of weathered MPD and virgin plastics over a sandy substrate. We conducted spectral feature analysis on the different plastic groups to better understand the impact that polymers have on our ability to detect synthetic debris at sub-pixel surface covers that occur on beaches. Our results show that the minimum surface cover required to detect MPD on a sandy surface varies between 2–8% for different polymer types. Furthermore, plastic composition affects the magnitude of spectral absorption. This suggests that variation in both surface cover and polymer type will inform the efficacy of beach litter detection methods.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

The tribological results suggested that the BJP316 showed comparable yield strength and friction behaviour to the traditional 316SS, while a significant improvement in wear resistance was achieved for test loads up to 80 N and reciprocating frequency up to 20 Hz. It is hypothesized that the smeared bronze across the wear track acted as a solid lubricant, while the formed passive oxide film acted as tribofilm that inhibited the abrasive wear under the high loads. Electrochemical evaluation indicated that the corrosion rate of BJP316 was one order of magnitude higher than that of the traditional 316SS in sea water. This study provides valuable insights into the tribocorrosion of binder jet additively manufactured 316SS in sea water environment, and helps to better understand its potential marine applications.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

However, the efficacy of marine reserve networks in frequently disturbed systems, such as coral reefs, has rarely been evaluated. Here we analyze a well-mixed larval pool model and a spatially explicit model based on a well-documented coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) metapopulation in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia, to determine the effects of marine reserve coverage and placement (in relation to larval connectivity and disturbance heterogeneity) on the temporal stability of fisheries yields and population biomass in environmentally disturbed systems. We show that marine reserves can contribute to stabilizing fishery yield while increasing metapopulation persistence, irrespective of whether reserves enhance or diminish average fishery yields. However, reserve placement and the level of larval connectivity among subpopulations were important factors affecting the stability and sustainability of fisheries and fish metapopulations. Protecting a mix of disturbed and non-disturbed reefs, rather than focusing on the least-disturbed habitats, was the most consistently beneficial approach across a range of dispersal and reserve coverage scenarios. Placing reserves only in non-disturbed areas was the most beneficial for biomass enhancement, but had variable results for fisheries and could potentially destabilize yields in systems with well-mixed larval or those that are moderately fished. We also found that focusing protection on highly disturbed areas could actually increase variability in yields and biomass, especially when degraded reef reserves were distant and poorly connected to the meta-population. Our findings have implications for the design and implementation of reserve networks in the presence of stochastic, patchy environmental disturbances.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

After application, fungicides can be transported offsite to surface and groundwater and ultimately enter estuarine and marine environments. The presence of fungicides in the marine environment may pose risks to marine organisms, but little is known about fungicide effects on these organisms, especially invertebrates. The present study investigated the effects of the commonly used boscalid fungicide Filan® on life history traits, feeding rate, and energy reserves (lipid, glycogen, and protein content) of the marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa over 6 wk under laboratory conditions. Amphipods were exposed to 3 concentrations of Filan (1 μg, 10 μg, and 40 μg active ingredient [a.i.]/L), with 5 replicates per treatment. Lipid content and reproduction were the most sensitive measures of effect, with lipid content reduced by 53.8% at the highest concentration. Survival, growth, and other energy reserves of amphipods were also negatively affected by Filan, and the effects were concentration dependent. Antennal deformities were incidentally observed on the amphipods at a concentration of 40 μg a.i./L. The results of the present study indicate comprehensive effects of the boscalid fungicide Filan on A. compressa at environmentally relevant concentrations. The decline or absence of A. compressa in marine ecosystems could impair the ecosystem function because of their important role in trophic transfer and nutrient recycling. The authors' results suggest that even though the use of fungicides is often regarded as posing only a minor risk to aquatic organisms, the assessment of their long-term effects is critical.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

However, the commercial viability of bioethanol production from marine algae is limited by the high cost of the pretreatment required to break down the cell wall and the high cost of nitrogen supplements used during fermentation. Development of alternative pretreatment and nutritional supplementation strategies is therefore crucial to the development of economically viable methods for producing these third generation biofuels. This research develops a novel method for fungal pretreatment of marine macroalgae. The method is both an effective pretreatment capable of breaking down the complex algae cell wall, and allows for fungal biomass to be recovered from the pretreatment stage and used as a nutrient supplement during fermentation. The study demonstrates that fungal pretreatment prior to enzyme hydrolysis increased sugar yields 2.3 fold compared to untreated algae, and nutrient supplementation using the recovered fungal biomass increased ethanol yields by up to 38.23%. This data suggests that the use of fungi for pretreatment and nutrient supplementation could greatly increase the economic viability of production of these third-generation biofuels.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

"Explosive blast damage resistance of fibre-polymer composites","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Explosive-blast-damage-resistance-of-fibre-polymer/9921863751301341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Alexander Gargano","2019","Fibre-reinforced polymer composites have been used in navy ship structures since the mid-1940s due to their ability to be strong, stiff, durable and easy to repair. More recently, composite materials have been increasingly more used due to the number of advantages they offer over conventional metallic materials. One major advantage of composite materials is that they have high stiffness and strength properties, whilst being incredibly lightweight. Low top-side weight increases sea-keeping and range and reduces fuel consumption. However, the use of composite materials in large ship structures is a concern for the Australian and US Navy due to their brittle-type failure when subjected to an explosive blast event. There is also an increased risk that the moisture rich environment that navy ships are continuously exposed to may reduce their explosive blast survivability. <br /> <br />In light of these challenges, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) funded a program to investigate the explosive blast response of commonly used naval composite materials (laminate and sandwich) and how their resistance is affected by long-term seawater immersion, which was the scope of this PhD research. The materials considered are representative composite materials used in naval ship structures. Three blast loading conditions are considered: far-field, near-field and contact. Finite element models and experimental tests are used to determine the deformation, damage and residual mechanical properties of several types of glass fibre and carbon fibre laminates following blast loading. The laminates considered were glass/vinyl ester, glass/polyester, carbon/vinyl ester and carbon/polyester materials, and all types are used in naval ship structures. The project also evaluates the deformation and damage to sandwich composites exposed to explosive blasts of varying intensity. The sandwich composites considered have a core of polymer foam or balsa wood.&nbsp; <br /><br />The effects of the fibre reinforcement, the polymer matrix and the bonding between the two (fibre-matrix interface) on the explosive blast resistance of composite laminates are experimentally investigated. When exposed to the same shock wave impulse, the resistance to deformation and damage was higher for glass fibre laminates compared with carbon fibre composites, and laminates with a vinyl ester matrix were superior to the polyester matrix materials. Also, laminates with strong interfacial bonding had greater explosive blast resistance than those with a weak interfacial bond. This work also identified that the blast resistance correlated with the flexural strain energy density of the laminates. The capacity of the glass fibres and vinyl ester resin to deform to greater strains without causing damage to the laminate resulted in superior blast resistance. Also, the delamination damage resistance of the vinyl ester laminates being higher than that of the polyester composites correlated with their greater modes I and II interlaminar fracture toughness properties, which was particularly important for superior blast properties in contact explosive tests. Laminates with strong fibre-matrix interfacial bonding had higher mechanical properties and interlaminar fracture toughness properties, which resulted in superior blast resistance.&nbsp; <br /><br />The explosive blast resistance of several types of sandwich composites is experimentally investigated. For the blast conditions used in this work, the resistance of the sandwich panels with glass fibre laminate skins to out-of-plane deformation was higher than the carbon fibre sandwich panels due to their greater energy absorption capacity. Also, the balsa core composites were superior to the PVC core composites at low blast impulse, however the weak shear strength of the balsa wood resulted in premature failure at medium blast impulses. The low compressive modulus of the PVC foam resulted in poor stress transfer to the backface skin, causing extensive damage to the front facesheet. <br /><br />The effect of high mode I and II interlaminar fracture toughness properties on the explosive blast damage resistance was further explored using three-dimensional (3D) woven composites. These composites contained different volume fractions of through-thickness woven fibrous tows. It was found that at low-medium blast impulses, the damage resistance of the 3D composites was similar to the 2D laminate. At the highest blast impulse, however, the amount of delamination damage to the 3D composites was much lower than the 2D laminate. The blast damage resistance of the 3D composites increased with their z-binder content under high impulse blast conditions. Also, the 3D composites remained intact whereas the 2D laminate completely shattered. The superior blast resistance of the 3D composites only occurred when the shock wave impulse was high enough to create a large-scale bridging process zone that opposes extensive delamination cracking. <br /><br />The effect of seawater immersion on the explosive blast resistance of composite laminates is also explored. It was demonstrated that long term seawater immersion of laminates degraded the polymer matrix and fibre-matrix interface, which reduced the flexural, compressive and interlaminar shear properties. The reductions to these mechanical properties resulted in greater amounts of deformation and damage to laminates when subjected to an explosive blast. However, the reduction to the blast damage resistance caused by seawater absorption was dependent on the type of laminate.<br /><br />This project also developed and validated a numerical (finite element) model to analyse the deformation and damage to metals and laminates subjected to airborne explosive blasts. FE modelling and experimental testing revealed that mild steel and aluminium (AA5083) plates outperformed the laminate plates at all blast impulses when the target plates were the same thickness. However, when the blast resistance is considered on the basis of specific areal weight of the target plate, then the glass fibre laminates were superior to the metals. The finite element (FE) model was able to predict the out-of-plane deformation and damage to the metal and carbon fibre laminate plates for all blast impulses with reasonable accuracy. <br /><br />These studies aimed to investigate the explosive blast resistance of current and future naval composite materials, and how their response is affected by long-term immersion in seawater. The outcomes of this PhD thesis will assist in the management of current composite naval vessels and aid in the material selection for future naval vessels for improved explosive blast resistance.","Navy","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

The work objective aimed to alleviate stress concentration in parts of the superstructure prone to fatigue-induced cracking. This is a novel approach to ship repair, which promises reduction in the cost of maintenance primarily due to greater efficiency and lower cost of repair. <br /><br />The work was conducted over approximately 12 years. It commenced in the late 80s with laboratory research and development and concluded in 2000 after completion of a seven-year trial on board a navy ship. Two carbon fibre composites, (5 m x 1 m consisting of a 25-ply laminate), were adhesively bonded to the 02-deck on the port and starboard sides. It was found that upgrading the structure using composites was effective, making it able to withstand service fatigue stresses. Finite element modelling and strain measurements on board the ship showed that critical stress concentration could be alleviated through stress redistribution. For the duration of the trial, no cracking of aluminium alloy deck in the vicinity of the reinforcements was reported. Both composite reinforcements exhibited good performance and remained in service after the end of the trial. <br /><br />However, the marine environment did cause some non-structural, edge debonding of the glass fibre reinforced overlay at the composite-metal interface. This overlay was designed to provide surface protection to the underlaying carbon reinforcement. Bond degradation was patchy. It occurred after about three years in service, most probably due to a combination of thermal cycling (solar heating/cooling) and water ingress at the interface. A new edge sealing method restored its durability and it required no further attention. <br /><br />This experiment was successfully demonstrated on board an active navy ship. The work proved that an effective and durable repair of a ship structure using non-metallic repair technology is feasible. Composite reinforcements prevented deck cracking and removed any need for welded repairs, thereby reducing the cost of ship maintenance. For further cost reduction it is recommended to adopt the principle of reverse engineering to simplify the technology for dockyard use.<br />","Navy","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Using experimental and analytical techniques, this PhD project aims to assess the structural properties in fire of three important types of light-weight materials; namely aluminium alloys, glass fibre laminates and glass fibre-polymer foam core sandwich composites. The fire performance of these light-weight materials are compared to steel. The thermal, physical and mechanical responses of the materials in elevated temperature and fire-like conditions are assessed, and the mechanisms controlling softening, damage and failure identified. The investigation is conducted for the axial tension and compression load states and a variety of stress and heat flux (fire intensity) conditions. Engineering structures are used in a wide range of geometric conditions in real world applications, and as such the effect of parameters such as material thickness, fibre orientation angle of laminates, and core density of sandwich composites on the fire performance is also investigated.<br /><br />A comprehensive review of published research on the elevated temperature and fire performance of aluminium alloy and composites materials is presented in this PhD thesis. The literature review assesses the current state of both experimental and numerical testing of metallic and composite materials subject to combined fire conditions and structural loading. Furthermore, the fire-induced damage mechanisms and failure of the composite materials are assessed at a constituent level. Based on the current state of research, gaps in the experimental and numerical research of metallic and composite materials subject to mechanical loading and one-sided fire conditions are identified. The research presented in this PhD thesis aims to address some of these important research gaps.<br /><br />The effect of fibre orientation on the deformation, softening behaviour and failure of unidirectional glass fibre laminates subject to fire is assessed experimentally and numerically in this PhD project. Experimental fire testing revealed fibre orientation has a large influence on the thermal, mechanical and deformation response of the laminate. The survivability of the laminate in fire-like conditions decreased rapidly with increasing fibre orientation (relative to the tensile loading direction). Increasing the fibre orientation angle caused the failure mode to change from fibre dominate to resin dominate, resulting in a large reduction in structural performance in fire. The softening and failure of the laminate is analysed using a thermal-mechanical model, and good agreement exists for on-axis or obtuse angles, however prediction of acute angled laminates where mixed-mode failure occurs is poor.<br /><br />An experimental and analytical investigation is also conducted into the structural performance of glass fibre laminates of different thicknesses using experimental fire-under-load tests. The investigation comprised of laminates with a wide range of thicknesses (1.25 mm - 18 mm). The tests are conducted for both the tension and compression load conditions. Increasing thickness affected the thermal response of the laminate which in turn affected the mechanical response of the laminates during fire exposure. Very thin laminates had a very small through-thickness thermal gradient and could be approximated as thermally thin. However, as the thickness increased the through-thickness thermal gradient also increased and this reduced the softening rate of the laminate resulting in an increase in time-to-failure. The softening and failure of the laminates with different thicknesses subject to fire conditions are assessed via a thermal-mechanical model under both tension and compression loading.<br /><br />Significant scatter in the time-to-failure of composite materials can occur during combined mechanical loading and fire exposure. The investigation into the fire performance of composite materials was extended here to assess the cause of scatter for both tension and compression load conditions. Variability in many properties of the laminate and its constituents are identified, and their ability to influence the fire performance assessed. The key sources of scatter are identified and a new statistical-based thermal-mechanical model is developed to predict the fire performance. <br /><br />Sandwich composite materials find common use in many engineering applications such as naval vessels and aircraft. Naval sandwich composites frequently employ rigid polymer foams at various densities for use as core materials due to their good resistance to salt water degradation, low water absorption, and buoyancy. One such polymer foam is rigid polyurethane. Here, the effect of core density on the structural integrity of sandwich composites during fire exposure is investigated. Through analytical and experimental analysis, core density was found to influence the thermal response of the sandwich composite with in turn affected the mechanical response, failure behaviour and ultimately time-to-failure. <br /><br />The effect of thickness on the fire performance of steel and aluminium alloy is numerically assessed in the tension and compression load conditions via a finite element model. The thermal-mechanical model, which has previously been validated to accurately predict the fire performance of aluminium in fire, was used for both metals. The effect of increasing thickness was smaller for aluminium than for steel due to its much higher thermal conductivity and lower creep activation energy. The relative fire-under-load performance of aluminium and steel is also assessed. The steel shows significantly better fire performance in both the tension and compression load conditions due to its superior elevated temperature properties, lower thermal conductivity and higher creep activation energy.<br /><br />An investigation into the relative structural integrity of steel, aluminium alloy, glass fibre laminate and glass fibre sandwich composites subject to one-sided fire conditions is undertaken. The thermal response, deformation behaviour and structural integrity for the materials are compared. The thermal response is dependent on the material type, with composite materials experiencing much greater temperatures than metals when exposed to the same heat flux. The difference in thermal response is due to the difference in material properties as well as the difference in damage behaviour. Composite materials often exhibit damage that retards conductivity of thermal energy from the heat exposed surface to the unexposed surface whereas metals do not. The fire-structural response of the materials is assessed for tension and compression load conditions. Steel performs best under tension load conditions due to its superior elevated temperature properties. The glass fibre laminate performed second best due to the thermal resistance of the glass fibres. The fire performance of the aluminium alloy and sandwich composite was similar. Under compression load conditions the steel and aluminium performed significantly better than the composite materials; and the sandwich composite performed the worst. The poor performance of the composite materials was due to the reliance on the polymer matrix properties under compression loading.<br /><br />The research presented in this PhD thesis contributes to the understanding of the thermal and mechanical response of load-bearing metallic and composite structures and their survivability when exposed to fire. Furthermore, important scientific insights into the damage behaviour and mechanisms contributing to failure during fire are identified. This research contributes significantly to the development of validated models and experimental data for light-weight materials in fire, and can be used to help evaluate the fire safety in modern engineering applications where fire is an ever present risk.","Navy","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Moreover, most of the safety climate research has been conducted using a quantitative approach, which cannot uncover the basic assumptions of the culture itself. In addition, the impact of national and military culture on aviation safety has not been addressed in the small amount of safety climate research which has been conducted in military organisations to date.<br /><br />One of the rationales for conducting this study is a growing concern regarding aircraft accidents that occur every year even though Indonesian military organisations have implemented safety management systems. This research was intended to examine the influence of Indonesian national culture and military organisational culture on aviation safety, particularly in the adoption and implementation of the SMS. The adoption and the implementation of an SMS have not made a significant impact since the organisation still experiences aircraft accidents. As the SMS is predominantly based on Western concepts of management, this study attempted to identify the characteristics of the Indonesian national and military organisational culture that influence the implementation of the program. Furthermore, this study investigated and identified the perception and behaviour of the military personnel and how management manages safety issues within the organisation.<br /><br />This study employed a qualitative research design, comprising multiple case studies. An ethnography-style research approach was adopted in order to acquire an understanding of the basic assumptions of a culture that drive people to a particular behaviour. In-depth semi-structured interviews, observations, and document analysis were the techniques used to gather data. Twenty-seven military personnel from four different operational air units participated in this research. The participants come from various backgrounds in terms of corps, ranks, and positions within their respective units. Thematic analysis was applied in this study and six phases of analysis, proposed by Braun and Clarke (2006) and Clarke et al. (2015), were used as guidance.<br /><br />Analysis of the findings showed that the Indonesian military culture has been much influenced by its national culture. Moreover, the unique characteristics of the Indonesian national and military cultures have significant influences on military aviation safety. Several characteristics of the Indonesian national culture, most of which have their origin in Javanese culture, such as hierarchical structure, authoritarian structure, rukun/harmony, unggah ungguh/manner, sungkan/reluctant, and asal bapak senang (ABS)/as long as the boss is happy, have impeded the implementation of the SMS and the promotion of safety culture. Similarly, some characteristics of the Indonesian military organisational culture such as punishment and reward, blame culture, class/rank structure, and siap/can-do culture are factors that obstruct the promotion of a safety culture and the implementation of an SMS. In addition to those cultural factors, the lack of safety education and training, and various perceptions of what constitutes safety have created a situation in which individual safety awareness has declined. However, one interesting finding reveals that there is a tendency for rules and procedures to become another alternative method for dealing with uncertainty. The unit personnel believe that rules and procedures can assist them to cope with uncertainty, in addition to their religious and spiritual beliefs.<br /><br />This study offers some contributions to knowledge and has the capacity to provide recommendations for Indonesian military organisation regarding its safety program. First, this is an empirical study that provides insight into how the cultural factors influence the implementation of the safety management systems and the promotion of a safety culture in Indonesia. Through this study, an in-depth understanding was acquired of the impacts of the unique military organisational culture on the adoption of Western concepts of management. It is expected that this study will extend various research on safety culture. Second, the findings of the study indicate that one cultural dimension - coping with ambiguity or uncertainty avoidance - is not consistent with Hofstede and GLOBE&rsquo;s description. In addition to religious and spiritual beliefs, the findings indicate that the increased use of rules and clearly-defined procedures are an additional means of coping with uncertainty. Third, this study recommends that the Indonesian military organisation integrate cultural factors into its organisation safety system, which is essential if the organisation is to successfully implement the SMS, promote a safety culture, and improve its safety. <br />","Navy","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"Nondestructive evaluation of the integrity of thick composite structures","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Nondestructive-evaluation-of-the-integrity-of/9922009506201341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Matthew Edward IBRAHIM","2021","Nondestructive testing and evaluation (NDT&E) is concerned with the detection, characterisation, and dimensional measurement of internal flaws in structural components. While the techniques in use today were developed largely for quality assurance in metal and alloy production, the continual drive to improve mechanical properties while reducing costs and hence weight has led to the gradual replacement of metallic alloys in high-end applications with fibre-reinforced polymer matrix composites (PMCs). Structures in which these feature prominently are: aircraft, wind turbines, petrochemical storage tanks, and even entire marine vessels. Techniques applicable to the evaluation of flaws in the thin quasi-isotropic carbon-fibre/epoxy skins used in aircraft have been well documented in the technical literature. However, the increasing use of thick PMC materials for primary load-bearing structures makes them impervious to many NDT techniques, and hampers the ability to detect and size internal defects. 
 
This Thesis addresses key gaps in the quantitative evaluation of `thick' composites - those for which the thickness is sufficient to offer variation in mechanical properties and which must be interrogated nondestructively in order to be qualified for service. It generates new understanding in the quantitative detection, sizing and characterisation of major production and in-service defects occurring in thick composite structures. The objectives of the Thesis are: 
i. to define the set of NDT techniques that can be employed in applied inspection scenarios; 
ii. to determine the relationship between defect detectability and depth in thick composite laminates using acoustic methods, generating or verifying where possible simulation models that can be used to further explore thick composite inspection problems; 
iii. to quantify defect sizing limitations in composite structures under load, and explain changes to the elastic wave propagation occurring when altering the stress state of a thick laminate; 
iv. to assess the ability of passive acoustic methods to predict failure in thick composite structures under cyclical loads, and 
v. explore the capability of non-acoustic methods to overcome acoustic shadowing and to discriminate between air- and water-based defects within a glass PMC. 
 
The suitability of a wide range of techniques to quantitatively inspect such materials is evaluated, and the effects of thickness on defect detectability and size measurements is determined. 
 
Significant new knowledge has been generated from this research project in a number of areas. These include: 
i. A comprehensive review of nondestructive evaluation technology specifically applicable to thick composites, including a reference guide for inspectors; 
ii. A model to correct for the effect of thick composites on ultrasonic beam shape, and that significantly improves the ability to detect and size small defects at depth, as demonstrated against the best published sizing data in thick PMC laminates; 
iii. Novel scientific analysis of the effect of hybridised carbon- and glass-fibre composite laminates on ultrasound propagation and defect detectability; 
iv. The first demonstration of the ultrasonic crack closure effect in composite materials undergoing compressive loads; 
v. The demonstration and comprehensive analysis of a material attenuation effect in glass-fibre composites undergoing bending loads; 
vi. The first application of acoustic emission to the prediction of fatigue failure in a solid structural hybrid marine composite; 
vii. The first demonstration of terahertz radiation to detect moisture ingress in solid glass-fibre composite materials. 
 
While this Thesis identifies various avenues of inquiry requiring further investigation, it records substantial progress in the understanding of the effect of thick PMC materials on NDT energies and how these may be accounted for when inspecting such structures.","Navy","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

"The elusive encounter: an exploration of memory and trauma through expanded spatial practice","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/doctoral/The-elusive-encounter-an-exploration-of/9922159012801341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Mig Elizabeth DANN","2022","Making art and writing at the intersection of creative practice and psychoanalytical enquiry, I explore how memory can be activated through art practice in a sensory, embodied encounter that reveals and transforms trauma. The expanded spatial practice of this doctoral research encompasses installation, textiles, text, video, photography, sound, sculptural objects, performance and artist books. Using sculpture, video and sound, I consider how material investigations and experimentation with the sensory aspects of memory can, through affect, embodied perception, intuition and felt knowledge, be a means to transform past trauma, which I approach as an ongoing lived experience in the present. For my primary research field of contemporary art, I approach trauma through the frame of trauma studies and related studies on the archive and situate this research within the intersecting methodologies of feminist art history and queer autoethnography. This challenges traditional conceptualisations of the impact of trauma on memory by focusing on identity, relationships and artmaking practices to bring about personal and sociocultural change. The research starts with the proposition that the encounter with material forms can engage memory to generate meaning through the embodied associations of materials used. I employ the principles of body-oriented psychotherapy, such as somatic experiencing, to explore how embodied sensations in artmaking can release the truncated energy of trauma to focus on a ‘felt sense’ of self. Once that energy is released, the narrative is reclaimed and made anew. The embodied processes involved in artmaking, including the use of sensory materials, tactile construction, assemblage (hand-formed, gestural), repetition and performance lead to release of the unconscious energy embedded in trauma. I reflect on emotions and my own lived experience to reimagine and rematerialise them, uncovering trauma as an element of a fractured then re-forming identity. This research argues that creative practice is a form of somatic experiencing in which trauma is revealed and transformed, moving from silence to testimony in a trajectory from personal to collective acts of memory. My aim, through personal and sensory exploration, is to challenge and transform the understanding of trauma-informed contemporary art in society.","Navy","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"Prognostic risk modelling of complex engineering projects using a system architecture approach with the application of 3PE methodology","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Prognostic-risk-modelling-of-complex-engineering/9921904510601341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Matthew Christopher COOK","2020","Many large and highly complex engineering projects are undertaken by organisations without a clear understanding of the technical and commercial risks. Injudicious decisions are subsequently made that fail to adequately manage or mitigate potential and residual risks. In cases where these risks are realised, the projects can suffer from budget overruns, schedule impacts/delays, technical faults/failures, reputation loss and ultimately a disappointed customer. One of the critical challenges of this research is the ability of the risk model to account for the perceived qualitative or subjective nature of risk assessments.
The objective of this research is to investigate and develop a risk analysis methodology that will allow organisations, particularly in the defence environment, to quantify their risks and to control risk profile throughout a project life cycle. The research was conducted primarily in the defence environment and applied a generic system engineering model, building on a well-defined system modelling methodology known as ""Product Process People Environment"" (3PE).
This research focuses on developing a unique quantitative risk model by applying the 3PE methodology to risk analysis. The 3PE method combines the elements of Product, People, Process within an environment and presents a topology where all risks can be assigned by their nature. This novel approach to risk modelling ameliorates all aspect of the risk process, with the three constituents (or elements) and their interactions forming a structured topology that is the basis for the determination of complex risks prevalent within projects. An exemplar or baseline risk profile can be calculated for current projects, which can be developed from previous projects that have understood outcomes.
The methodology developed in this research introduces a unique analysis model and risk identification structure to generate a visual risk profile for the life cycle of the project. To ensure a holistic and consistent approach to deciding mitigation strategies, the model incorporates the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to the 3PE topology to prioritise risks. This enables cross sections of the project enterprise to be given appropriate attention in terms of urgency and resources towards risk resolution and mitigation.
From this risk modelling, it is possible to identify and importantly visualise specifically what and where the key risk drivers reside and the impact of mitigations, along with the ability to control, manage and monitor risks throughout the life cycle. This analysis results in the development of a risk profile that can be presented in a visual format and manage/track both residual and emergent risks throughout the project life cycle. The potential development of a relationship between the model and a risk burndown chart, has been further developed as a means of associating the identified risks with both their predicted financial and schedule impacts and what effect proposed mitigations will achieve. The methodology includes a graphical burndown plot representing the entire life cycle risk management for engineering projects, to ensure an organisation can successfully deliver on technical and contractual obligations for large complex engineering projects. It allows for the continued management and visualisation of risks and enables a process of continued analysis to both reduce and/or mitigate residual risks and emergent risks progressively to acceptable levels.
Another area that forms part of this research, is the formation of an Alliance to execute a large and complex project. An alliance is generally thought of as a risk reduction strategy for sharing the technical challenges, tapping into appropriate resources, ensuring competitive edge, sharing the financial burden and schedule pressure of large challenging projects. This strategy has the benefit of distributing both the financial burden and technical effort across several organisations, ensuring specific attributes and skill sets are exploited in the right areas. However, there is growing evidence that the formation of an alliance actually brings added complexity to the structure of the project and leads to a significant increase in the overall risk level of the project. Some sources suggest that the failure rate of alliance projects could be as high as 50%.
This research analyses ways that risk pathways increase as more partners join the alliance and actually increase the risk profile of the project. Furthermore, research goes on to propose a model that has the ability to allow managers and engineers alike to identify and assess how risks can multiply as internal organisation and external project risks are generated and combined. These risks include technical, process, behavioural and cultural issues that can exist and/or develop between organisations, thus increasing the challenge of achieving success. A number of case studies have been undertaken throughout this research to both demonstrate and refine the model. This includes the complete life cycle analysis of a large historical defence project that was used to holistically demonstrate the model.   It should also be noted that some of the methods of calculation chosen are not mandatory and the proposed model has considered the need for flexibility to allow for alternative interpretations and weightings. A risk model is regarded as useful if it can identify key risks from quantitative data and suggests possible mitigation strategies. While many organisations already attend to highlighting risks with an array of tools, software and/or process methods, their calibre is often diminished by over-complexity and convoluted processes that are too involved. Hence, probably the most important characteristics of a risk model should be simplicity and ease of use.
This research has contributed a new methodology that quantifies and models the relative risk profile of a project throughout the project life cycle. It is important to state that this research has focused primarily on major projects conducted within both the UK and Australian defence environment. This is mainly due to available sources of information. However, it is necessary to highlight that this research and the risk model it has developed is equally transferrable to other disciplines, industries and countries.","Navy","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Edge computing is a very promising technology for provisioning realtime AI services due to low response time and network bandwidth requirements. Due to the lack of computational capabilities, an edge device alone cannot provide the complex AI services. Complex AI tasks should be divided into multiple sub-tasks and distributed among multiple edge devices for efficient service provisioning in the edge network. AI-enabled or automatic service composition is one of the essential AI tasks in the service provisioning. In edge computing-based service provisioning, service composition related tasks need to be offloaded to several edge nodes for efficient service. Edge nodes can be used for monitoring services, storing Quality-of-Service (QoS) data, and composing services to find the best composite service. Existing service composition methods use plaintext QoS data. Hence, attackers may compromise edge devices to reveal QoS data of services and modify them for giving an advantage to particular edge service providers, and the AI-based service composition becomes biased. From that point of view, a privacy-preserving framework for AI-based service composition is required for the edge networks. In our proposed framework, we introduce an AI-based composition model for edge services in the edge networks. Additionally, we present a privacy-preserving AI service composition framework to perform composition on encrypted QoS data using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) algorithm. We conduct several experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed privacy-preserving service composition framework using a synthetic QoS dataset.","Ai","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered edge devices (edge-AI) facilitate intelligent IoT data acquisition and services through data analytics. However, data in edge networks are prone to several security threats such as external and internal attacks and transmission errors. Attackers can inject false data during data acquisition or modify stored data in the edge data storage to hamper data analytics. Therefore, an edge-AI device must verify the authenticity of IoT data before using them in data analytics. This article presents an IoT data authenticity model in edge-AI for a connected living using data hiding techniques. Our proposed data authenticity model securely hides the data source's identification number within IoT data before sending it to edge devices. Edge-AI devices extract hidden information for verifying data authenticity. Existing data hiding approaches for biosignal cannot reconstruct original IoT data after extracting the hidden message from it (i.e., lossy) and are not usable for IoT data authenticity. We propose the first lossless IoT data hiding technique in this article based on error-correcting codes (ECCs). We conduct several experiments to demonstrate the performance of our proposed method. Experimental results establish the lossless property of the proposed approach while maintaining other data hiding properties.","Ai","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

IoT edge sensors and their associated data play a predominant role in today's Industry 4.0 ecosystem. Breaching data or forging source devices after injecting advanced persistent threats damages the industry capital and even loss of lives. The existing security challenges of Industry 4.0 include sophisticated cyberattack injection targeting vulnerable edge devices, insecure data transportation, trust inconsistencies among stakeholders, privacy-incompliant data storing mechanisms, etc. IoT edge servers often suffer because of their lightweight computation capacity to filter data anomalies properly, transport large-scale data securely and maintain data collaboratively with privacy, which altogether makes IoT systems exposed to attackers and hackers.  
 
Therefore, there has been an intense concern for security alternatives because of the recent rise of cyberattacks, mainly targeting enterprise, health and energy IoT infrastructures. Existing attack detection largely depends on machine learning techniques. However, the model trained on corrupted data should escalate suffering than defend the system. Moreover, conventional IoT security mechanisms employ trust from Public-key-Infrastructure third parties which can increase costs and mostly seems incompatible with the lightweight IoT ecosystems. While seeking alternatives, blockchain technology unveils promising security strengths to uphold a secure IoT setup. The loopholes of traditional attack detection, certificate-authority-dependent authentication, and privacy-incompetent communication have motivated the project to extract valid problems and solutions in the cybersecurity domain. After describing four research questions and methods, this dissertation focuses on how blockchain technology coupled with artificial intelligence foster certificate-less authentication and privacy-preserved cyberattack protection mechanisms. 
 
Firstly, the unique contributions include locally detecting malicious data to save the IoT system from failure. The blockchain-based solution demonstrates a novel false data detection and reputation preservation technique  based on the fuzzy rules and behaviors of the IoT-enabled cyber-physical system. It improves detection accuracy and eliminates single points of failure. Secondly, sensors and parties constitute a consortium blockchain network to authorise both data and sources that ensure trusted communication among participating devices. The demonstrated methods obviate the long-established certificate authority after enhancing the consortium Blockchain which reduces the data processing delay and increases cost-effective throughput. The distributed industry 4.0 security model entails cooperative trust using multi-signature than depending on a single party. Thirdly, it brings an efficient advanced persistent threat detection mechanism at the edge and transparent recording of the detection history in an immutable ledger where the edge-compliant storage technique facilitates efficient predictive maintenance. Finally, a blockchain-enabled, privacy-preserved collaborative machine learning model shields the IoT system internally at the edge and externally at the dedicated server. It allows other client devices to work flawlessly without being impacted by the delay of incurred by nearby clients and also empowers edge devices to contribute in training to downsize the server workload. Nonetheless, the outcomes of extensive experiments presented in this thesis explain the soundness and significance of the proposed research methods through respective qualitative and quantitative analysis. The evaluation results also confirm the applicability of the proposed methods for the real-time, large-scale and collaborative Industrial IoT system.","Ai","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

The now ubiquitous presence of automated reading and writing tools (such as auto-correct and -complete, grammar assistance, text prompts, and conversational agents using speech recognition and synthesis) all contribute to what has been described by McLuhan and others as a ‘post-literate society’ (McLuhan, 1964; Groys, 2012). Technologies such as A.I. are now part of larger human-nonhuman processes that have the potential to shape the world they were originally tasked to merely observe and categorize (Braidotti, 2013). This research uses a custom-made autonomous-art-system to look critically at postdigital literature within a ‘post-literate’ society. 

CONTRIBUTION 
In an attempt to render visible some of the embedded processes (and potential biases) of A.I. technologies, this custom-coded net artwork generates a constantly evolving page-design based on any spoken word &/or written text; based on algorithmic parsing of the text for salience, semantic function and sentiment. The artwork cycles through recombinations of any text by ‘illuminating’ the language through a system of original paratextual designs (typography and symbols), marking up and disrupting its semantic and sentiment ‘reading’. Designed by Simionato and coded by Donnachie, the artwork embraces the entropy and slippage of language and leverages the uncanny effect of machine-learning and A.I. systems on human-human and human-nonhuman communication.

"AI-aided design of multiscale lattice metastructures for controllable anisotropy","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/AI-aided-design-of-multiscale-lattice-metastructures/9922201835801341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Zhongkai Ji (External Author); Dawei Li (External Author); Wenhe Liao (External Author)","2022","Controllable anisotropy of the microscale lattice metastructures is the key to achieving designable mechanical properties of the macrostructures. However, a current computational challenge is precisely controlling the anisotropy of the design domain containing an ultra-large number of lattice structural units. In this work, we decompose the large-scale design domain into several mesoscale subregions and propose an artificial intelligence-aided design method that can automatically control the anisotropic properties of the mesoscale design domain. First, a 3D convolutional neural network is proposed to replace the time-consuming homogenization computation process, thus enabling fast prediction of equivalent mechanical properties of lattice structures with arbitrary geometrical and material parameters. Then, inspired by the encoded metaplot, the mesoscale design domain is divided into several subunits with certain encoding. Finally, the combination type of the lattice structures of the subunits is adjusted automatically by a genetic algorithm according to the given target anisotropic properties. Furthermore, the effects of the lattice types, subunit numbers, and species number of subunits contained in the subregion on the accuracy of the inverse design are discussed. The results show that the proposed intelligent design method can effectively control the anisotropic properties of the mesoscale design domain.","Ai","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"AI Affordances Perception for the Transformation of Mobility Ecosystems","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/conferenceProceeding/AI-Affordances-Perception-for-the-Transformation/9922136756001341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Mingye Li (RMIT Student Author)","2021","Artificial Intelligence (AI) can transform organisations, industries, and ecosystems if organisations explore the AI affordances. Likewise, researchers should investigate what AI affordances organisations perceive, actualise, and why - areas that are in dire need of conceptual and empirical research. The conceptual distinction between AI affordances perception and other AI related constructs should not be ignored. This research develops a contextualised conceptual framework to explain AI affordances perception of organisations within the mobility ecosystem. Drawing from the affordances and social cognitive theories, the study proposes two AI affordances perception constructs, that is, vicarious and autonomous AI affordances. It develops a nomological net of factors and suggests propositions how these factors might influence the two AI affordances perceptions. Our conceptual work offers a foundation for investigating AI affordances and developing other models related to AI affordances actualisation. Future research can test and validate the framework.","Ai","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"Has Australia been late in turning to address the Ai challenges?","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/bookChapter/Has-Australia-been-late-in-turning/9922222251101341?institution=61RMIT_INST","None","2022","This study focusses on artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on Australian industry. AI is threatening by disruption within businesses, and government globally. The value of AI to the global economy is expected to increase by $16 trillion by 2030 (GEF, 2017). Organisational leaders are focusing on answering questions such as ‘where should we target investment, and what kind of capabilities would enable us to perform better?’ (PWC, 2017: 4). Like most countries, Australia is experiencing a great change in the way work is performed. To increase the knowledge concerning the challenges of Australian organisations in relation to AI and bearing in mind the huge impact of AI in the Australian workforce, this chapter now focuses on the perception of human resource (HR) departments of Australian organisations on AI. The effective application of AI to HR also presents different challenges that affect the overall aspects of organisations (Tambe et al., 2019). Through a quantitative research method, we attempt to understand perceptions of HR departments on AI in the Australian industries context. Findings suggested eight themes: Perception on AI; Transition to AI; Strategy involving AI (Strategy-Finance and Strategy-ethics); Government in relation to AI; Industry type (AI effects on industry type); HR / HR professionals (HR and ethics, HR & HR AI systems, Work balance, HR & Strategy; HR-Skill shortages); Fear; and Frustration.","Ai","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

applications (AI apps) for information, advice, and purchase. As the main actor in the
service delivery process, these AI apps and their novel resources not only co-create but
also co-destroy value with customers in a more complex way. This study explores the
contributing factors of value co-destruction during the interaction between customers
and AI apps. Drawing on the service dominant logic perspective, we analysed 1,683
negative reviews from eight AI apps retrieved from Google Play and App Store. We
identified six different types of values (utilitarian, hedonic, symbolic, social, epistemic,
and economic values) that can be co-destroyed. The contributing factors of value codestruction include system failure, threat of self, privacy concern, and justification of the
result. Our findings offer theoretical contributions to the AI-driven service literature and
provide practical recommendations for designing AI apps to avoid value co-destruction.","Ai","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

While the contest is very challenging (and, at times, frustrating) for students, it was successful in keeping them engaged. More importantly, a significant majority of students reported enjoying and learning from it. A powerful software tool to automate the competition for large number of teams is made freely available.","Ai","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"Effects of authenticity on customer retention of AI-powered branded app: A conceptual paper","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/conferenceProceeding/Effects-of-authenticity-on-customer-retention/9922212061601341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Trang Vo (RMIT Student Author)","2022","Branded apps, especially with AI integration, have been used to build customer-brand
relationships, showcase service promotions, and collect data from consumer interaction.
However, the high rate of branded app abandonment after the short use is one of the concerns
of marketing professionals. Previous studies have mainly explored the customer retention of
this app through its social, hedonic and utilitarian benefits. Drawing on the traditional
marketing notion of authenticity, this paper proposes the new concept of AI-powered branded
app's authenticity, its drivers, and outcomes. This research contributes to the U&G theory,
current knowledge of authenticity, AI-powered branded app and customer retention literature.
From a practical perspective, examining authenticity in the age of AI is particularly timely, as
this information may help brand managers effectively develop a branded app that positively engages customers.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Sustainable Institutional Food Systems: Implementation of AI Tools for School Nutrition Program Management in the United States of America","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Artificial-Intelligence-AI-for-Sustainable-Institutional/9922159978601341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Stephanie Camarena (RMIT Student Author)","2022","School food programs can improve the nutritional status at community level, and can be a powerful tool to facilitate a transition to sustainable food systems, particularly through their purchasing methods and meal/waste management. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enable or inhibit transitions to sustainability, due to its capacity to facilitate transformational change and disruption. Thus, AI can have major impacts on achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those related to food systems. This paper focuses on critically exploring different aspects during the implementation of a software project in US schools that used AI techniques to enable agility and provide healthy food options for schoolchildren. Participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis were used to inform the case study and uncover the new processes developed using the technology. As a key barrier to the effective management of school food programs and nutrition is the administrative load associated with statutory compliance, this case study demonstrates the difference that AI-powered tools can make in alleviating the weight of administrative processes. An Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-enabled boundary spanning framework is used to extend the case study toward an analysis of the systems, boundaries, relationships and perspectives which starts mapping the areas where the private sector, public institutions and civil society can meet to fast-track sustainable transition activities, particularly in the context of food systems. This article presents some possible approaches to facilitating these activities, inviting policy makers to bridge the gap with businesses and use business agility to support common societal goals to achieve sustainable food systems.","Ai","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

The laboratory test for determining strain at each location within rock samples is expensive and difficult but rock strain data are important for predicting failure of rock material. Many researchers employ AI technology in order to solve these difficulties. AI algorithms such as gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and group method of data handling (GMDH) are used to efficiently estimate the strain at every point within a rock sample. Additionally, the ensemble unit (EnU) may be utilized to evaluate rock strain. In this study, 3000 experimental data are used for the purpose of prediction. The obtained strain values are then evaluated using various statistical parameters and compared to each other using EnU. Ranking analysis, stress-strain curve, Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, actual vs. predicted curve, error matrix and the Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) values are used for comparing models. The GBM model achieved 98.16% and 99.98% prediction accuracy (in terms of values of R2) in the longitudinal and lateral dimensions, respectively, during the testing phase. The GBM model, based on the experimental data, has the potential to be a new option for engineers to use when assessing rock strain.","Ai","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

The adopted approach capitalizes upon FourDimensional Trajectory (4DT) functionalities, supporting an uncertainty-resilient and flexible strategic deconfliction framework to improve the operational efficiency and security of Demand-Capacity Balancing (DCB) services. The objective is to accommodate future UAM and other autonomous vehicle-based business models by safely implementing traffic management in dense low-altitude airspace around cities and suburbs. The proposed UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system uses metaheuristic algorithm, especially the Tabu-search algorithm, to determine a global optimised rerouting solution. The calculated solutions can be continuously used as labelled data to train and optimise a machine learning process for real-time decision making, greatly improving the computational performance of intelligent UTM systems.","Ai","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Moreover, the components of healthcare systems are interconnected via the Internet, bringing significant changes to the delivery of healthcare services to individuals. However, easy access to healthcare services and applications has given rise to severe risks and vulnerabilities that hamper the performance of a smart healthcare system. Moreover, a large number of heterogeneous devices accumulate data that vary in terms of size and formats, making it challenging to manage the data in the healthcare repository and secure it from attackers who seek to profit from the data. Thus, smart healthcare systems are susceptible to numerous security threats and risks, such as hardware and software-based attacks, system-level attacks, and network attacks that have the potential to place patients’ lives at risk. An analysis of the literature revealed a research gap in that most security surveys on the healthcare ecosystem examined only the security challenges and did not explore the possibility of integrating modern technologies to alleviate security issues in the smart healthcare system. Therefore, in this article, we conduct a comprehensive review of the various most recent security challenges and their countermeasures in the smart healthcare environment. In addition, an artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain-based secure architecture is proposed as a case study to analyse malware and network attacks on wearable devices. The proposed architecture is evaluated using various performance metrics such as blockchain scalability, accuracy, and dynamic malware analysis. Lastly, we highlight different open issues and research challenges facing smart healthcare systems.","Ai","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
