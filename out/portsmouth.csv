"Towards a theory of small-firm low-tech food innovation","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/towards-a-theory-of-small-firm-low-tech-food-innovation","Vyas, V.; Vyas, R.","14 Aug 2014","Innovation in low-tech sectors such as food & drinks continues to be under-researched and under-theorised despite growing evidence on low and medium technology sectors’ substantial contribution to economic growth in the developed countries. This attempt to build theory from case study research, contributes to an embryonic literature in this area through a set of propositions grounded in process theory and organisational innovativeness literature. We postulate that small firm food innovation is shaped exogenously by the cultural context of food consumption and internally by high-variety-low-volume manufacturing environment of the innovative firm. The ensuing incremental innovation is underpinned by a counterintuitive avoidance of development of health foods. These innovative efforts are abetted by the large retailers who, in turn, use these agile enterprises’ creativity and plasticity to achieve their own competitive goals. The propositions outlined here complement the extant theory through a sharper contextual focus in contrast to the previous research.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

"Promoting road safety","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/promoting-road-safety","Esbester, M. O.","Apr 2015","This article is among the first historical considerations of road safety in Africa. It argues that race and class, as colonial dualisms, analytically frame two defining moments in the development of African automobility and its infrastructure—“Africanization” in the first decade of Kenya’s political independence from Britain, 1963–75, and democratization in postapartheid South Africa. We argue that recent road safety interventions in both countries exemplify an “epidemiological turn” influenced by public health constructions of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. African states’ framing of road safety in behaviorist terms has obscured larger debates around redressing the historical legacies of racialized access to roads and the technopolitics of African automobility. Civic involvement in road safety initiatives has tended to be limited, although the specter of road carnage has entered into the public imagination, largely through the death of high profile Africans. However, some African road users continue to pursue alternative, and often culturally embedded, strategies to mitigate the dangers posed by life “on the road.”","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

As a giant Ariadne’s thread, these bent metal structures help to better orientate the users around the campus. At the same time, the project aims to link the existing network of faculties, emphasising their interdisciplinary nature and thus creating a unique system. The landmarks evoke a thread that, with simple structures, emerge from the ground and stitch together the most important places on the university campus. Only the central landmark is more complex and iconic, since it represents the beginning and the end point of the thread, and it is placed in the central university quad.The design was carried out in collaboration with Korea Tech and a group of students in order to develop the idea and to further implement the detailed design. The process was thus an experiment of practical and educational design, with concepts that bridge art, architecture, and urbanism. The structures have enhanced the quality of the public space and helped to create a sense of appropriation from the users.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

The focus of such studies remains high-technology enterprises, which continue to attract both academic and popular interest, oblivious to the innovative endeavours of people in traditional low-tech industries. This book attempts to address this imbalance through a comprehensive analysis of innovation in this largely neglected area. Based on case studies of seven small innovative food companies, this book presents an in-depth analysis of innovation in the Scottish food and drinks industry and unravels a lesser-known approach to effective low-cost product innovation, which is simple and economical, yet elegant and successful. Using careful data collection and rigorous statistical testing, the analysis and findings in this book address a wide spectrum of interests: academics in business schools, policy makers in governments and executives and entrepreneurs in food and other low-technology sectors.

Accordingly, it is argued that academic's basic research focus started shifting towards applied research as it is essential for the radical inventions to be introduced in a competitive market. This research seeks to understand industry-academia linkages in a high tech field such as nano-crystals. In regards to supporting the technology transfer process within or cross country, this study illustrates the technology development trends and actors' engagement; nano-crystals technology and their interconnections; and maps the organisational (industry-academia) linkages that enhance the commercialisation of radical inventions. The results show that the industry-academia linkages that appeared as decentralized structure are more stable compared to other linkage types. Korean and Japanese organisations present such stable linkages. The linkages are even stronger when they appear as a mono-linkage type. Chinese organisations show a great illustration of such an effective mono-linkage of co-inventorships in high tech research field. The organisations in the US maintain international linkages.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

But within this phenomenological umbrella, attention is now being focussed upon the policing of 'hi-tech crime'. This policy intervention again underlines the importance of an understanding of the new international policy networks, their transnational dynamics of governance, and the democratic opportunities for intervention in the policy process. The paper will first outline the development of the policy networks on organised crime within the European Union and G8. Second, by focussing upon the development of policies on hi-tech crime within three international fora, the paper will underline the apparent importance of 'infrastructural power' in ensuring that the policing of hi-tech crime is translated to the law enforcement agenda.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"
"Survival and growth of high-tech SMEs: some uncommon strategies","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/survival-and-growth-of-high-tech-smes-some-uncommon-strategies","Vyas, V.","2009","Innovation, by its very nature, disrupts the equilibrium of a competitive market and causes uncertainty. To confront it, the enterprise must innovate further. This competition driven innovation (Cantner et al., 2004), which is central to technical progress and responsible for keeping large corporations vibrant, however, creates peculiar difficulties for the new firm. As R&D budgets burgeon and technical change accelerates, innovation becomes even more focused and competitive. Markets take unanticipated paths hammered by the onslaught of innovators. New products spring up and disappear before people have a chance to look at them and the inventors have time to exploit the gains of their creation. The scale of creative destruction wrought by entrepreneurs trying to break into rival markets using innovative edge of their products and processes has been, of late, growing increasingly discomforting. No wonder, the closure rates are mounting and the steady advancements in knowledge continue to leave behind entrepreneurial mass graves. It seems, the new enterprise in the next century is going to awaken to a competitive reality that is both overwhelming and scary. Entrepreneurs everywhere are now facing the classic Schumpeterian competition, the one that strikes not at the margin of profits and output, but at their very lives. Though the technical innovations of the past decades have opened up a whole gamut of opportunities for start-ups, they have also, sharpened the edge of competition and have increased its ability to mop down the relatively inefficient. As efficiency standards rise, survival becomes increasingly difficult for new enterprises. Effective management and exploitation of change of this magnitude and complexity is extremely difficult. Under such intense uncertainty, there seems to be no guarantee of payoffs from any programme to improve technology (Metcalfe, 1997).","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

It investigates a) the motives behind SMEs’ coopetition b) coopetitive benefits for SMEs and for the market c) the coopetition success’ barriers. Using qualitative methods, we find that i) coopetitive SMEs pursue rent-gaining strategies with reduced financial risk, and are able to improve the market ii) motives relate to financial risk reduction and performance improvement iii) coopetitive SMEs accessed resources, improved quality, enabled economies of scale and knowledge diffusion in the industry iv) lack of trust or overtrusting can limit coopetition’s success v) geographical proximity is important practically or for strategic positioning. The majority of coopetition research focused on large enterprises in technological-intensive industries. We contribute to the understanding of the transferability of coopetition theory outside its traditional context, by bringing evidence of coopetition strategies between SMEs belonging to an alternative, fast growing and highly coopetitive industry.

Further, it analyses two case studies related to aspects of security and safety: the Virginia Tech Shooting in 2007 and the Lion Air 610 crash in 2018. Both case studies address the concept of learning from failures. In doing so, an analysis of the root causes and vulnerabilities through the methods of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) is conducted to identify lessons to be learned. Results: Findings are intended to stimulate organisational learning and improve organisational processes to mitigate disasters from happening again. Conclusion: The value of this study is that aspects of learning and unlearning from failures have been identified for the cases used. Expectation for future studies is to extend the proposed methodology to other cases in the fields of surveillance, security and safety. ","Tech","University of Portsmouth"
"Supply chain drivers, partnerships and performance of high-tech SMEs: An empirical study using SEM","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/supply-chain-drivers-partnerships-and-performance-of-high-tech-sm","Rezaei, J.; Trott, P.; Ortt, R.","23 Mar 2018","Purpose – In this study, high-tech small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SME) supply chain partnerships are examined. Partnerships are considered at the level of business function rather than the entire organisation. Secondly, the drivers of SMEs to engage in partnerships are assessed to see whether functions engage in partnerships for different reasons. Thirdly, performance per function is assessed to see the differential effect of partnerships on the function’s performance. 

Design/methodology/approach – In this study, the relationship between the drivers of SMEs to engage in partnerships, four types of partnerships (marketing and sales, R&D, purchasing and logistics, and production) and four types of functional performances of firms (marketing and sales, R&D, purchasing and logistics, and production) are examined. The data has been collected from 279 SMEs. The proposed hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). 

Findings – The results indicate that there are considerable differences between business functions in terms of the degree of involvement in partnerships and the effect of partnerships on the performance of these functions. This paper contributes to research by explaining the contradictory results of partnerships on SMEs performance.

 Practical implications – This study helps firms understand (i) which type of partnership should be stablished based on the firm’s drivers to engage in supply chain partnership; and (ii) which partnership has a significant effect of which type of business performance of the firm.

 Originality/value – The originality of this study is to investigate the relationship between different drivers to engage in supply chain partnership and different types of partnerships and different functional performance of firm in a single model. ","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

Together the articles provide a look at a variety of approaches across North America, Europe, and Africa and at different road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers. While most of the papers individually consider a single national example, the picture that is built up across the issue allows comparisons between countries to demonstrate how road safety and automobility technologies are historically and culturally contingent. The issue concludes with a commentary from a prominent policymaker in the hope that better understanding of how accidents, safety, and risks are co-constructed and co-produced can offer insights into how we might reduce deaths and injuries in the future.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

P.; Chen, J.; Jin, Q.; Liu, W.","3 Dec 2020","This paper presents experimental and analytical studies on flexural behavior of slab-rib integrated Sandwich composite decks. The influences of layers of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) facesheets, foam densities, and the existence of webs and cross beams are discussed herein. The test results showed that the existence of vertical webs remarkably improved the debonding of the facesheets from the foam core, thus increasing the ultimate load by 59% compared with the specimens without webs. However, the existence of horizontal webs has insignificant effect on the failure mode and ultimate load. Increasing the number of layers of GFRP facesheets from 2 to 4 and 6 results in 100% and 214% increments in ultimate loads, respectively, while the specimen with lower density of foam had a higher ultimate load than the specimen with higher density of foam due to deformation compatibility between GFRP skins and foam core with low density. The analysis software Abaqus Explicit was used to simulate the flexural behavior of test specimens, and the numerical results agreed well with the test data. The verified finite element model was extended to analyze the influences of the number of GFRP layers on the top of decks and the height of vertical webs. Based on equivalent method and compatibility of shear deformation, the flexural and shear rigidities were estimated. Then, analytical solution for displacement of the slab-rib integrated Sandwich composite decks subjected to four-point load was derived out. Comparison of analytical and experimental results shows that the displacements can be precisely predicted by the present theoretical model.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

Much of research on business innovation, however, is focussed on high-tech sectors and innovation studies of low-tech businesses are rare. This paper reporting a doctoral research on innovation in Scottish food industry attempts to address this lacuna. Another impetus for this study stems from the fact that though Scotland has historically been at the vanguard of scientific, industrial and business innovations, it has legged behind recently and has consequently become one of the less competitive regions within Europe. This study of innovation in one of Scotland’s major industries is thus both interesting and relevant. This paper reports results of semi-structured personal interviews and personality tests of innovativeness of key decision makers in 8 Scottish food companies known for innovation. The results show that the personality of people responsible for new product development plays a significant role in giving a business its innovative proclivity. Innovative food companies in Scotland follow an analogous process of idea generation, validation, implementation and full product deployment with some minor, though, significant departures. Innovators in Scottish food industry consider packaging innovation an inseparable part of product innovation. They, however, largely shun creation of healthier versions of foods, as an innovation option.  A major finding of this study -supermarkets as the main drivers of innovation in Scottish food industry- is a revelation and raises need to revisit their role in regeneration of regional economies.

"Axial compressive behavior and energy absorption of syntactic foam-filled GFRP tubes with lattice frame reinforcement","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/axial-compressive-behavior-and-energy-absorption-of-syntactic-foa","Jin, Q.; Wang, J.; Chen, J.; Bao, F.","1 Nov 2022","A kind of innovative foam-filled glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) tube with lattice frame reinforcement was proposed for improving energy absorption capacity. The crushing experimental results revealed that lattice frame reinforcement contributed to increasing compressive strength and energy absorption, by ∼33 and 90%, respectively, for syntactic foam-filled GFRP tubes and their plateau stress almost increased to peak strength. Decreasing distances between transverse or vertical bars resulted in increasing energy absorption in composite columns with GFRP shells. The effects of lattice frames on the mechanical behaviors of composite columns without GFRP shells was less significant compared to columns with shells. Under the same content in foam cores, the energy absorption ability of syntactic foam-filled GFRP tubes with lattice frame reinforcement was much higher than that of specimens reinforced by MWCNTs. In addition, an analytical model considering the local buckling of lattice frames was proposed to predict the ultimate crushing load of composite columns with reinforcement. The analytical solutions agreed well with experimental results. This study provided a promising approach for designing a lightweight composite column with a high capacity for energy absorption, which could be used as an energy absorption member in engineering structures.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

The impact test results showed that the penetration depth of GFRP panels with synthetic foam is much smaller than that of bare synthetic foam panels. The edgewise compression test results indicated the facesheet debonding dominates the failure mode of the sandwich panels without lattice webs, while the failure mode of the sandwich panels with lattice webs is predominated by the wrinkling and delamination of the facesheets and the crushing of foam core. The influences of applied impact energy, GFRP lay-up, synthetic foam density and the existence of webs on the impact and post impact behavior of sandwich panels are discussed herein. Analytical models are proposed to predict the residual ultimate edgewise compressive load capacity of sandwich panels with lattice webs after impacts, using energy principles and variational methods in applied mechanics. The influences from impact damage, the local buckling of the facesheets and the confined strength of the foam core are measured and compared well with proposed analytical models.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

In particular, this paper presents the development of an integrated model, which links a regional economics social accounting matrix (SAM) model to an ecological model constructed using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software. The impacts on the ecological–economics–social system are examined by varying fishing efforts for four scenarios, including status quo management, fishing effort reduction policy, fishing gear switch policy, and summer closure extension policy. Key results from the predictions (2010-2020) and policy simulations illustrate that the collapse effect is apparent in the status quo scenario. Further, reducing or switching of fishing effort (e.g. elimination of overfishing and reduced habitat disturbance) positively affects the ecosystem and can lead to economic and social welfare gains in the PRE’s economy. The gear switch scenario presents a compromise among the economics, social, and conservation metrics, and also outperforms other scenarios in terms of biomass at the end of the simulation period. The fishing effort reduction policy performs better than the summer closure extension policy in terms of the conservation metrics but does relatively poorly in economic terms.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

The paper proposes a computable general equilibrium model that can evaluate changes in the economic and social indicators. This model is connected to an Ecopath with Ecosim model that can simulate the dynamics of an ecosystem. The integrated model is constructed to investigate how different scenarios of fishing effort and catch management reflecting varying levels of input and output in four fishery management simulations result in different states of the socio-economic and ecosystem structure. Four alterative fishing management scenarios are defined, namely: (1) fishing intensity and policies maintain the status quo; (2) fishing vessel reduction is implemented as an input control policy; (3) fishermen are required to transfer to others jobs as an input control policy; and (4) total landing reduction is implemented as an output control policy. The modelling results show that the output control policy has the most positive effect on ecosystem restoration and can increase overall social welfare. The fishermen switching policy leads to the most positive increase in economic indicators, whereas the policy of fishing vessels reduction has a positive effect on ecosystem restoration, but also a considerable, negative impact on the social and economic dimensions. To achieve sustainable utilisation of marine fishery resources, China's fisheries management policies should be developed to enhance total output control and ecosystem reconstruction.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

Even though environments impose some constraints on organizations, they still have a range of response. We find that newspapers, in Turkey, have three different identi-ties. One rooted in journalistic values. One rooted in running the newspaper as a business. And one rooted in maintaining its leadership role. These identities trigger three different transitive strategic responses. A transitive response is one in which an organization has an attack and a fall-back position. Further, we show how the link between an organization’s identity and its strategic response is moderated by the dominance of relations with institutional environment and the dominance of relations with technical environment. We tested these ideas in a pilot test with supportive interviews, and then in a large scale quantitative study.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

At interview, some children were asked to gaze towards either the interviewer's face (IF) or a teddy bear's face (TF), whereas some children were given no gaze instruction. In both the IF and TF conditions, lie-tellers provided significantly fewer details than truth-tellers. A total of 192 adult evaluators then judged the credibility of 10 children's reports from one of the three ‘gaze’ conditions with and without guidance on level of detail. Evaluators discriminated truths from lies successfully when judging children instructed to look at IF, but not when children were asked to gaze towards TF. Evaluators who received guidance demonstrated better discrimination between true and false reports than evaluators who received no such information. ","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

A.; Manville, R.; Popa, O.; Cuello, L.; Goldstein, S.","30 Jun 2020","TOKs are outwardly rectifying K+ channels in fungi with two pore-loops and eight transmembrane spans. Here, we describe the TOKs from four pathogens that cause the majority of life-threatening fungal infections in humans. These TOKs pass large currents only in the outward direction like the canonical isolate from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScTOK), and distinct from other K+ channels. ScTOK, AfTOK1 (Aspergillus fumigatus) and H99TOK (Cryptococcus neoformans grubii) are K+-selective and pass current above the K+ reversal potential. CaTOK (Candida albicans) and CnTOK (Cryptococcus neoformans neoformans) pass both K+ and Na+ and conduct above a reversal potential reflecting the mixed permeability of their selectivity filter. Mutations in CaTOK and ScTOK at sites homologous to those that open the internal gates in classical K+ channels are shown to produce inward TOK currents. A favored model for outward rectification is proposed whereby the reversal potential determines ion occupancy, and thus conductivity, of the selectivity filter gate that is coupled to an imperfectly restrictive internal gate, permitting the filter to sample ion concentrations on both sides of the membrane.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

We empirically examine the feasibility of using previous MGPD models and our suggested model to explain the market growth of new products from high-technology industries. The results show that the new model exhibits better curve fitting and forecasting performance than the prior MGPD models in the cases of this study.

The method of this study follows classification as part of the preprocessing step to determine R&D, engineering, and high-tech industry-related job advertisements. Afterward, we use clustering methods to identify areas where key human capital is required, and investments are made by R&D-oriented companies. The results show that it is possible to identify sector-oriented skill requirements and that the significance of the R&D skills varies. For the case of Turkey, we can clearly show the national human capital and R&D by identifying nine key clusters that indicate R&D progress and directions.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

To resolve this controversy, specific information is needed on the implementation of these partnerships by SMEs; an area, that, thus far, has received little academic attention. In this paper, we examine different business functions (production, marketing and sales, purchasing and logistics, research and development (R&D) and finance) within a supply chain partnership. We collected data for each individual function from 279 high-tech SMEs and examined the relationship between the specific types of partnerships and the overall performance of the SMEs. The results indicate that it is only in the area of R&D that partnerships have a significant positive effect on overall firm performance. The results imply that SMEs primarily can benefit from particular types of supply chain partnerships, i.e. R&D partnerships. The results contribute to the debate in the literature by explaining why many SMEs were found not to benefit from these partnerships. We also provide implications for firms and how SMEs can better utilise supply chain management (SCM).","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

Based on recent (2001–2015) comprehensive satellite‐based datasets (surface air temperature, land surface temperature, snow cover, daytime and nighttime cloud), this study finds that annual mean surface air temperature warming rates show rapid decrease above 4500 m despite increasing from 2000 to 4500 m. This indicates a reversal in EDW at the highest elevations on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is somehow different from the EDW derived from short‐term land surface temperature presented in an early study. The decrease of warming rate above 4500 m coincides with the elevation at which most of the current solid water resources reside. Thus, their decline may be less rapid than previously thought. Trends in nighttime cloud and snow cover are both correlated with patterns of EDW on the TP, but the leading factor varies on an annual and seasonal basis. Comparing datasets provides important evidence for understanding EDW and its controlling mechanisms in an extreme high‐elevation context.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

R.; Zhao, J.; Failler, P.; Wang, Y.","9 Sept 2019","Study of fisheries policy has conventionally been limited to partial equilibrium analysis where capture fisheries are considered in an isolated world without connection with the rest of the economy and without endogenous change in prices. This causes a two-way problem in policy analysis in that firstly consequences of fisheries policy cannot spread out of the sector and thus incorporate feedback from the rest of the economy, and secondly any economic policy also cannot affect the fisheries sector. As a result, any policy analysis regarding the fisheries sector cannot be accurate or even correct. This research builds a computable general equilibrium model for Thai fisheries to study full consequences of fisheries or economic policies in Thailand. The model specifies the economic activities of not only capture fisheries but also aquaculture, fish processing and fish marketing sectors as well as the rest of the economy, and captures their interactions. The empirical applications of the model with market-based policy instruments such as fishing taxes and subsidies reveal that fisheries or economic policies aiming to protect the resources or restructure the sector, if properly designed and combined, can achieve their goal as well as avoid potential losses.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

However, the evolutionary processes affecting variation at a genomic scale have not been investigated in most vertebrate lineages. Here, we present the first population genomics survey using whole genome resequencing in the green anole (Anolis carolinensis). Anoles have been intensively studied to understand mechanisms underlying adaptation and speciation. The green anole in particular is an important model to study genome evolution. We quantified how demography, recombination, and selection have led to the current genetic diversity of the green anole by using whole-genome resequencing of five genetic clusters covering the entire species range. The differentiation of green anole's populations is consistent with a northward expansion from South Florida followed by genetic isolation and subsequent gene flow among adjacent genetic clusters. Dispersal out-of-Florida was accompanied by a drastic population bottleneck followed by a rapid population expansion. This event was accompanied by male-biased dispersal and/or selective sweeps on the X chromosome. We show that the interaction between linked selection and recombination is the main contributor to the genomic landscape of differentiation in the anole genome.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

D.; Bourgeois, Y.; Meheretu, Y.; Boissinot, S.","1 May 2022","Taxon-specific characteristics and extrinsic climatic and geological forces may both shape population differentiation and speciation. In geographically and taxonomically focused investigations, differentiation may occur synchronously as species respond to the same external conditions. Conversely, when evolution is investigated in taxa with largely varying traits, population differentiation and speciation is complex and shaped by interactions of Earth's template and species-specific traits. As such, it is important to characterize evolutionary histories broadly across the tree of life, especially in geographic regions that are exceptionally diverse and under pressures from human activities such as in biodiversity hotspots. Here, using whole-genome sequencing data, we characterize genomic variation in populations of six Ethiopian Highlands forest bird species separated by a lowland biogeographic barrier, the Great Rift Valley (GRV). In all six species, populations on either side of the GRV exhibited significant but varying levels of genetic differentiation. Species’ dispersal ability was negatively correlated with levels of population differentiation. Isolation with migration models indicated varied patterns of population differentiation and connectivity among populations of the focal species. We found that demographic histories—estimated for each individual—varied by both species and population but were consistent between individuals of the same species and sampling region. We found that genomic diversity varied by half an order of magnitude across species, and that this variation could largely be explained by the harmonic mean of effective population size over the past 200,000 years. Overall, we found that even in highly dispersive species like birds, the GRV acts as a substantial biogeographic barrier.","Tech","University of Portsmouth"

R.; Westin, M.; Lande, S.; Cragg, S.","Oct 2015","New approaches are needed to prevent borer attack in wood intended for use in the marine environment, because traditional treatments are restricted or prohibited in this end use. Wood modification is a promising alternative, but the modification processes may require optimisation for marine end use. The standard testing method as defined by EN275 requires long term marine testing in which an iterative approach to process refinement is not feasible. This study used rapid laboratory testing protocols and marine tests to evaluate the efficacy of furfurylation in reducing attack by marine wood borers. Laboratory trials provided rapid assessment of potential treatments under controlled conditions, whilst marine trials provide more robust long term results under realistic exposure conditions. The wood samples were treated with one of three proprietary procedures for inducing polymerisation. Established methods for testing with the boring crustacean Limnoria allowed comparisons to be made with known timber species with a reputation for durability under marine conditions. Wood modification was shown to achieve useful reductions in feeding rate and survival of test organisms. Statistically robust results were obtained within four weeks. New methods for assessing the effects of wood modification on settlement and subsequent grown by shipworms yielded similarly robust and rapid results. The findings were compared with data for the same wood modifications obtained in a standard marine trial. Field and laboratory findings were in broad agreement. The laboratory methods were shown to be suitable for iterative optimisation of modification.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

It is argued that marine citizenship requires an enhanced awareness of marine environmental issues, an understanding of the role of personal behaviour in creating and resolving marine environmental issues, and a shift in values to promote marine pro-environmental behavioural choices. It is concluded that the value shift is likely to be produced by the development of an altered relationship between the state and the individual, in which the expectations placed on citizens by the state are extended to include marine pro-environmental behaviour.

Ghana is endowed with numerous valuable natural recourses both on land and sea. Exploitation and management of these resources often leads to conflict, land tenure dispute and environmental problems due to poor administration of land and marine rights, interest and responsibilities. In June 1999, the government of Ghana lunched a new national land policy that sought to address some fundamental problems associated with land administration and management in the country. A computer aided information system land cadastre was proposed. At the moment the government of Ghana is working on implementing a system for the management and administering land in a spatial context with limited attention to the interface (shoreline) and marine spatial data infrastructure where issues of pollution, overexploitation, conflict and disputes are not only national but also international. This paper concludes that marine cadastre could provide the basis for identifying wider variety of stakeholders and involving them in the decision-making processes associated with good marine administration and coastal zone management. The identified stakeholders could be made to take responsibility of any damage they may cause to the environment.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

The potential role of marine citizenship in UK marine governance was examined by surveying UK marine practitioner's views on both the current and future role of marine citizenship. Observations from this study identified three key factors for discussion including conflicting opinions over the implementation of marine citizenship into policy; that marine-focused education and a sense of personal attachment are integral to the development of marine citizenship; and that as yet, the potential implications of an enhanced sense of marine citizenship are uncertain.

A portion of the detritus they generate is carried into the oceans from land and highly productive blue carbon ecosystems—salt marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows. This large detrital input receives scant attention in current models of the global carbon cycle, though for blue carbon ecosystems, increasingly well-constrained estimates of biomass, productivity, and carbon fluxes, reviewed in this article, are now available. We show that the fate of this detritus differs markedly from that of strictly marine origin, because the former contains lignocellulose—an energy-rich polymer complex of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin that is resistant to enzymatic breakdown. This complex can be depolymerized for nutritional purposes by specialized marine prokaryotes, fungi, protists, and invertebrates using enzymes such as glycoside hydrolases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases to release sugar monomers. The lignin component, however, is less readily depolymerized, and detritus therefore becomes lignin enriched, particularly in anoxic sediments, and forms a major carbon sink in blue carbon ecosystems. Eventual lignin breakdown releases a wide variety of small molecules that may contribute significantly to the oceanic pool of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon. Marine carbon fluxes and sinks dependent on lignocellulosic detritus are important ecosystem services that are vulnerable to human interventions. These services must be considered when protecting blue carbon ecosystems and planning initiatives aimed at mitigating anthropogenic carbon emissions.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

The sectoral approach is key to economic development in Africa with potential for income gener-ation, employment creation and poverty reduction, as well as creating blue and green carbon sinks to address climate change problem and environmental management in African LMEs. The sectors establish linkages to countries’ established Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change making it possible to promote Integrated Approach at national, regional and continental sustainable development in Africa. The approach is complemented by the utilizing desk-top literature review and secondary data source on LMEs in Africa for blue economy. This approach is supplemented with professional experts’ views and opinions, and additional data gathered from field visits to 13 African countries in August 2019 and Nairobi, Kenya Africa Blue Economy Strategy Consultative Workshop in October 2019. The Blue Economy approach development in Africa will benefit both inland and coastal countries. It is recommended that a strong development of the continental tourism will boost the demand for tourism services and infrastructures. The development of eco-tourism will contribute to the con-servation of ecosystems and reduce the ecological footprint. Blue Carbon and Ecosystem Ser-vices offer an opportunity to develop coastal wetland projects to mitigating climate change. Coastal protection, biomass production and water purification are among the most important eco-system services delivered by African LMEs. Their current value is estimated to the average mon-etary value of carbon sequestration of about USD 130,000 per km2 of mangrove, salt marshes and sea grasses.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

M.; Failler, P.","3 Sept 2020","African sustainable energy and marine mineral resources have the potential for significant contributions to African economic development goals through job creation and contributions to the Gross Domestic Product of the countries bordering the seven African Large Marine Ecosystems – Canary Current, Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Somali Coastal Current, Agulhas Current, Benguela Current and the Guinea Current. Though their potential is not fully assessed, based on our preliminary assessment it is expected that by 2030 and 2063 blue energy could add value of about USD1.6 billion and USD2.3 billion, in mining of minerals about USD76 billion and USD123 billion, and in oil and gas production about USD100 billion and USD138 billion, respectively. By 2030 and 2063 blue energy employment can reach about 0.2 million and 0.5 million jobs, in ocean mining about 2 million and 4 million jobs could be created, and in oil and gas production about 1.8 million and 5 million jobs would be expected. In order to achieve these benefits, Africans need to tackle complex technical and policy related challenges. Among the recommended changes, it would be necessary to unlock sustainable blue energy regulations with forward looking new development policies.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

We studied 2 marine reserves in northeastern New Zealand, the Leigh Marine Reserve (established 1975) and Tawharanui Marine Park (established 1982) in order to assess whether changes in protected predator populations had resulted in other indirect changes to grazers and consequently to algal abundance. Estimates of abundance of the most common demersal predatory fish Pagrus auratus indicated that adults of this species (i.e. large enough to prey upon urchins) were at least 5.75 and 8.70 times more abundant inside reserves than in adjacent unprotected areas. Overall, P auratus were also much larger inside reserves with mean total lengths of 316 mm compared with 186 mm in fished areas. The spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii displayed similar trends, and was approximately 1.6 to 3.7 times more abundant inside the reserves than outside. Lobsters within the reserves had a mean carapace length of 109.9 mm, compared with 93.5 mm outside the reserves. In one of the reserves, densities of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus had declined from 4.9 to 1.4 m-2 since 1978 in areas formerly dominated by it. Consequently, kelp forests were more extensive in 1998 than they were at the time of reserve creation. Urchin-dominated barrens occupied only 14 % of available reef substratum in reserves as opposed to 40""4 in unprotected areas. These changes in community structure, which have persisted since at least 1994, demonstrate not only higher trophic complexity than anticipated in Australasian ecosystems but also increased primary and secondary productivity in marine reserves as a consequence of protection. Trends inside reserves indicate large-scale reduction of benthic primary production as an indirect result of fishing activity in unprotected areas.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

All major stages of the fouling process are investigated. The effect of ianthelline on adhesion and growth of marine bacteria and microalgae is tested to investigate its influence on the initial microfouling process comparing with the known marine antifoulant barettin as a reference. Macrofouling is studied via barnacle (Balanus improvisus) settlement assays and blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) phenoloxidase inhibition. Ianthelline is shown to inhibit both marine micro- and macrofoulers with a pronounced effect on marine bacteria (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values 0.1–10 μg/mL) and barnacle larval settlement (IC50 = 3.0 μg/mL). Moderate effects are recorded on M. edulis (IC50 = 45.2 μg/mL) and microalgae, where growth is more affected than surface adhesion. The effect of ianthelline is also investigated against human pathogenic bacteria. Ianthelline displayed low micromolar MIC values against several bacterial strains, both Gram positive and Gram negative, down to 2.5 μg/mL. In summary, the effect of ianthelline on 20 different representative marine antifouling organisms and seven human pathogenic bacterial strains is presented.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

J.","Oct 2013","New Zealand’s ‘Marine Protected Areas Policy’ is currently being implemented, and requires background information concerning the scientific and biodiversity values of marine reserves. This review determines the current state of knowledge, discusses the value of marine reserves for scientific research and biodiversity conservation, assesses trends in scientific productivityin marine reserves, places New Zealand work into an international context, and suggests future research priorities. Marine reserves in New Zealand have the primary function of protecting spatially delimited areas from the effects of fishing. Their success is generally measured by the recovery of exploited species within their boundaries, which is reliant on consistently conducted monitoring time series. Estimates of recovery have now been obtained from several reserves, showing that snapper (Pagrus auratus), blue cod (Parapercis colias), and rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) all respond positively to protection, although the speed and magnitude of recovery tends to be variable and site-specific. Recovery of these predators has been linked to changesin reef habitats through trophic cascades, effects on small cryptic reef fishes, and effects on assemblages in nearby soft-sediment habitats. New Zealand’s contribution to the study of marine reserves has slowed in recent years, reflecting reduced funding for marine ecological research nationwide, changes in composition and research emphasis in scientific personnel, but also reluctance in some regions to approve manipulative experimental work within marine reserves. Whilst direct effects of marine reserves on fisheries are uncertain and difficult to demonstrate, the use of unfished areas to act as controls for the effects of fishing on almost all aspects of marine ecological study is a potentially powerful, but as yet only partially realised, researchtool. In addition to providing unfished areas for estimating population parameters of fished species, marine reserves could provide spatial references for the state of fished stocks, controls for effects-of-fishing studies, inform models of ecosystem structure, and provide the opportunity for detecting previously unrealised linkages between habitats and species. Continued progress in this area will benefit from a unified approach to research involving long-term partnerships between management, researchers, and funding agencies. The review concludes with recommendations on how this may be achieved, and suggests priorities for future research to further utilise marine reserves in understanding the marine environment.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

Specifically, a 15% increase in fuel cost results from the
formation of diatom-dominated biofilm on ocean going

The term ‘resilience’ was originally developed within mechanical and engineering studies for defining the structural stability or robustness of a material or a structure. From this perspective, resilience is the ability of a structure to resist and absorb perturbations and disturbances without changing (Van der Leeuw & Leygonie, 2005; Woods, 2006).
Further research has developed the definition of resilience within the ecology domain, as the ability of systems to absorb disturbances and persist. In this sense, resilience is a natural and emergent property of a system that allows its adaptation and persistence across dynamic environments and adversities (Holling, 1973; Gunderson, 2000; Klein et al., 2003; Bodin & Wiman, 2004; Olsson et al., 2004).","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

This work was carried out as part of the EVA programme which looked at estimating the economic and social value of marine ecosystems within West African Marine Protected Areas (MPA). The remote sensing methods utilised in this study are innovative in that they stem from non supervised combined classifications and principal component analysis. These techniques offer a reliable method for the calculation of ecosystem surfaces, as well as estimation of their health status, both elements that are compulsory to the economic valuation exercises. From an application perspective, this modelling process is particularly relevant to regions of data-poor marine ecosystem mapping where biodiversity conservation is developed or large-scale areas where access is made difficult and costly in time and financial resources. Further, these results are likely to influence the identification of priority areas for conservation measures as part of the MPA management plan.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

The timbers tested were beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky), oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.), chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.), and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The marine trial was conducted over a period of 5 months at Mersin on the southern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Activity by teredinid (Mollusca, Bivalvia) borers during this period was very high, resulting in the maximum rating of 4 on the EN 275 scale for P. sylvestris sapwood and heartwood panels. Q. petraea panels averaged 2.8 and C. sativa panels were attacked the least with a mean rating of 2.3. There was little variation between the timbers tested in the size of the shells of the teredinids found, and so variation in the level of attack can be ascribed to fewer animals colonising C. sativa and Q. petraea than P. sylvestris. About one half of the teredinids identified were Teredo navalis (Linnaeus 1758), one quarter Bankia carinata (JE Gray 1827), and one quarter Nototeredo norvagica (Spengler 1792). No evidence of preference for a particular timber by any of these species was observed. Teeth on the ridges of the shells of teredinids from C. sativa were partially or wholly immersed in a dark brown substance that might reduce the boring efficiency of the shell. Some attacking by limnoriids (Isopoda, Crustacea) was also detected. Specimens of the amphipod crustacean Chelura sp. were observed on panels of C. sativa. In a laboratory screening trial in which the feeding rate of individual Limnoria quadripunctata (Holthuis 1949) was assessed by measuring faecal pellet production, feeding on heartwood of C. sativa, F. orientalis, and Q. petraea averaged less than half of that on the non-durable sapwood and heartwood of P. sylvestris.

To influence the discourse on the societal need for MPA networks a matrix approach is used to determine the potential for conservation features within the UK proposed network of 127 MPAs to deliver beneficial ecosystem processes and services. The results suggest a non-uniform distribution of ecosystem services across the network, with the majority of MPAs containing conservation features with the potential to deliver ecosystem processes. Designation of the full recommended network of MPAs may provide a form of ecological insurance against further decline in the delivery of beneficial ecosystem services and may also contribute to wider ecological health by supporting broadscale ecological processes. Non designation of MPAs that contain low frequency of occurrence beneficial ecosystem processes or services could result in their loss. Given the uncertainty about the connections between ecological function and the delivery of beneficial ecosystem processes, conservation policy and management must consider an ecologically coherent MPA network to be a minimum spatial requirement to secure the future delivery of ecosystem services.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

Marine operations, both inshore and offshore, are normally sensitive to environmental conditions. For the majority of operations threshold weather criteria will be predefined. An estimate of the likelihood of the operation experiencing 'bad' weather, taking into account the uncertainties in weather forecasting, is of great value. The method is intended to be used as part of a risk assessment of marine operations, enabling the impact of design and scheduling decisions to be assessed in a structured and systematic way. The method has two components. Firstly, the time to complete an operation is defined in the form of a probability/time distribution. This is done by analysing the duration of the tasks within the operation and identifying possible causes of delays. The likelihood and duration of each delay is estimated. Secondly, a probability/time curve is defined for the weather conditions exceeding the predefined threshold. The curve is determined by reference to the location of the marine operation, the time of year of the operation, the initial weather conditions and the accuracy of weather forecasting. Using the two probability/time curves, the likelihood of exposure is calculated.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

This socio-cultural evidence gap is due to inherent difficulties in defining and eliciting cultural values, but also to difficulties in linking cultural values to specific places, thus enabling an area-based approach to management. This paper addresses three aspects that are important for including marine cultural values in MSP: Defining cultural values, identifying places of cultural importance, and establishing the relative significance of places of cultural importance. We argue that common classification schemes such as cultural ecosystem services can be a helpful starting point for identifying cultural values, but only go so far in capturing communities' cultural connections with the sea. A method is proposed for structuring a community-based narrative on cultural values and “spatialising” them for MSP purposes, using five criteria that can lead to the definition of “culturally significant areas”. A baseline of culturally significant areas is suggested as an aid to planners to pinpoint places where cultural connections to the sea are particularly strong. Throughout, we emphasise the need for participative processes.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

Furthermore, the test does not evaluate abrasion resistance.  Novel fast-track screening methods were employed in this study to evaluate the marine borer and abrasion resistance of eighteen lesser used timber species.  Comparative resistance was assessed by comparing the feeding rates of marine borers and abrasion resistance observed in candidate species against greenheart and ekki which were used as benchmark species.  A number of lesser used species, originating from South America and West Africa, performed better than the benchmark species in laboratory tests and over an eighteen month exposure period in the sea.  A number of species also performed comparatively well in abrasion trials although resistance to abrasion does not necessarily correlate with resistance to attack by marine borers.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"
"Institutional frameworks in the administration of coastal and marine space in Africa","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/institutional-frameworks-in-the-administration-of-coastal-and-mar","Boateng, I.","2006","This paper reviews institutional frameworks in the administration of coastal and marine space in Africa. A basic law of human nature is that Man’s needs and wants are unlimited; however, the natural resources of the earth are limited. This makes it obvious that resources need to be managed so as to ensure their sustainability. Coastal and marine spaces have a multiplicity of use, which leads to conflict among users; to avoid conflict there must be rules. Institutions have evolved throughout history, not only to control man but also the way he uses natural resources including coastal and marine space. Therefore, effective administration of any kind of natural resource requires clear understanding of available institutional frameworks and their consequent impact on the management of that resource. Different institutional approaches are needed in different contexts due to variations in cultures, values and societal norms. This paper also considers the nature of resources in coastal and marine spaces and the need for surveyors and other stakeholders to be aware of the importance of institutional frameworks in managing these resources. The paper concludes that in order to meet global challenges, institutional frameworks in Africa have changed from an informal regime to a more formal (constitutional) regimewithout progressive transition in many cases. This has often led to poor administration of coastal and marine space, lost of right and livelihood of many indigenous peoples who subsist on coastal and marine resources. It therefore, recommends the involvement of all stakeholders’ especially local resource users at all levels of institutional change.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

Palynology is seen to be the key discipline to tackle this challenge and recent efforts to use climatic signatures recorded in palynomorph assemblages for cross-basin and interbasinal correlations of Karoo-aged basins in southern Africa are very promising. Their near continuous basin fill from the Pennsylvanian to the Early Jurassic captures the most prominent climate change in the Phanerozoic. Postglacial coal-bearing successions of Permian and Triassic age in the Main Karoo Basin of South Africa enable detailed studies of changing vegetation on land. Marine black shales capture changes in paleoceanographic conditions as reflected in marine phytoplankton assemblages and changing terrestrial input of pollen grains and spores, enabling precise correlation of terrestrial coals and marine shales. Ongoing research aims to establish the use of climate signals recorded in terrestrial and marine palynofacies for correlation on a Gondwana-wide, interregional scale.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

This review covers recently published research on the global species composition and dynamics of marine biofilms, consisting mainly of bacteria and diatoms found on man-made surfaces including AF coatings. Marine biofilms directly interact with larger organisms (macrofoulers) during colonization processes; hence, recent literature on understanding the basis of the biofilm/macrofouling interactions is essential and will also be reviewed here. Overall, differences have been identified in species composition between biofilm and planktonic forms for both diatoms and bacteria at various exposure sites. In most studies, the underlying biofilm was found to induce larval and spore settlement of macrofoulers; however, issues such as reproducibility, differences in exposure sites and biofilm composition (natural multispecies vs. monospecific species) may influence the outcomes.","Marine","University of Portsmouth"

As the RNZN’s fleet consists of just 11 vessels and New Zealand has one of the largest exclusive economic zones in the world, the achievement of that aim is extremely challenging. The RNZN is expected to conduct a wide range of tasks from combat to customs patrols and also needs to be interoperable with other regional players such as Australia and the US. The RNZN is a credible small navy and is generally effective in the roles that it undertakes, but given the projected increase in security challenges that the service is expected to face, it can be argued that the triangular factors of strategic objectives, defence capabilities and defence resources in New Zealand are currently out of synch. New Zealand is an inherently maritime nation and the RNZN is central to both its security and prosperity. It is essential that further investment is committed to the RNZN in order to enable it to fulfil all of the tasks expected of it and to ensure that it can achieve its aim to be the ‘best small nation navy’.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

This book tells the story, not just of defeats and victories, but also of how the navy has adjusted to over 100 years of rapid technological and social change. The navy has changed almost beyond recognition since the far-reaching reforms made by Admiral Fisher at the turn of the century. Fisher radically overhauled the fleet, replacing the nineteenth-century wooden crafts with the latest in modern naval technology, including battleships (such as the iconic dreadnoughts), aircraft carriers and submarines. In World War I and World War II, the navy played a central role, especially as unrestricted submarine warfare and supply blockades became an integral part of twentieth-century combat. However it was the development of nuclear and missile technology during the Cold War era which drastically changed the face of naval warfare - today the navy can launch sea-based strikes across thousands of miles to reach targets deep inland. This book navigates the cross currents of over 100 years of British naval history.As well as operational issues, the authors also consider the symbolism attached to the navy in popular culture and the way naval personnel have been treated, looking at the changes in on-board life and service during the period, as well as the role of women in the navy. In addition to providing full coverage of the Royal Navy's wartime operations, the authors also consider the functions of the navy in periods of nominal peace - including disaster relief, diplomacy and exercises. Even in peacetime the Royal Navy had a substantial role to play. Covering the whole span of naval history from 1900 to the present, this book places the wars and battles fought by the navy within a wider context, looking at domestic politics, economic issues and international affairs. It will be essential reading for anyone interested in naval history and operations, as well as military history more generally.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

R.","1999","A review of the literature on heat strain and aircrew and a questionnaire survey of Royal Navy aircrew have been completed. Aircrew appreciate, some 50% from first hand experience, that heat strain can reduce their operational endurance and performance. They are at greatest risk of developing it in the pre-flight period, especially when wearing Nuclear, Biological, or Chemical (NBC) protective equipment. Several techniques they use to reduce this risk are described. Some may be of particular assistance in the field should air conditioned facilities be unavailable. However, opportunities to improve the thermal environment within the aircraft on the ground and in flight are limited as the heat generated within it and high levels of solar radiation impinging on it severely challenge air conditioning units, themselves constrained by weight and size. Other demands placed on protective clothing offer little potential to increase the rate at which aircrew can lose accumulated heat. It is concluded that an appropriate micro-climate cooling system worn next to the skin may be required to achieve truly significant reductions in heat strain. Research at the Institute of Naval Medicine has identified liquid cooling techniques which may be suitable for aircrew in all but the smallest helicopters. Any views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of the Department.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

The navy played a central role in the evacuation of the retreating British army at Dunkirk, and later orchestrated the sinking of Germany's mighty battleship and Hitler's pride, the Bismarck. Without the Royal Navy's attention to the defence of Britain's seaborne trade - especially in the struggle against German U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic - there would not have been food for the country, fuel for the RAF's operations or supplies to keep the army fighting in Europe, North Africa and the Far East. Yet the outstanding naval contribution to Britain's survival and eventual victory came at a heavy cost in terms of ships and to the men who had to face not just the violence of the enemy, but also the violence of the sea.

Naval manpower planners need to consider appropriate measures to improve retention in the service. The paper considers a number of factors that affect the likelihood of early exits from the navy. We classify these factors as external (macroeconomic, and labour market conditions) and internal (job specific) factors. The paper uses a Cox proportional hazard approach to measure individual naval ratings’ propensity to leave early from the navy.

The results show that gender is a significant factor affecting propensity to leave the navy. Females are more likely to leave when compared to their male counterparts irrespective of age. The results also indicate that married females are more likely to leave (around 1.1 times more likely to do so) when compared to their unmarried counterparts indicating that marital status transitions are very influential in explaining separations from the navy.

Overall the empirical results suggest that the navy should concentrate more on the needs and requirements of high-risk exit groups, with particular emphasis on 'work/life' balance. In addition, appropriate mechanisms need to be put in place in order to inform naval ratings of the relative financial benefits of staying within the navy as compared to civilian life. Naval manpower planners should also promote aggressively the non – pecuniary benefits (medical care, subsidised accommodation, job security etc.) offered by the navy to their personnel.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

We hypothesise that similar to civilian workers, job transition decisions of the RN ratings are dependent upon alternative job availability and macroeconomic conditions. In addition, working conditions, gender and skill mix, family commitments and promotion prospects in the Navy influence their decisions to leave early. We estimate the unemployment elasticity for males to be _0.65 (female _0.51), which is high, compared to the elasticity reported for the US Navy. The civilian wage is positively related to exit probability from the RN.

This is mainly due to a number of organisational challenges and changes in operational requirements and priorities. Naval manpower planners need to consider appropriate measures to improve retention in the service. The evidence gathered from the empirical investigation shows that external (pull) factors exert a significant effect on the early exit/quit rates from the Royal Navy. Key economic factors such as pay and employment opportunities in the civilian employment markets play an important role in the decisions that individual ratings make with regard to remaining in naval employment or leaving altogether. In particular, it was found that quit rates from the Navy are negatively associated with the claimant count (unemployment) rate (i.e. as the unemployment rate in the civilian economy increases, the early exit rate from the Navy decreases), whilst the overall increase in civilian wages bears a positive relationship on quitting behaviour. The analysis provides further evidence to support the need for policies that are tailor-made to cater for different ratings' specialisations within the Royal Navy.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

This paper analyses ratings’ voluntary (quits) and involuntary (separation) exit patterns from the Royal Navy using an independent competing risks hazard regression analysis framework. The results show that both voluntary and involuntary exits are pro cyclical with respect to macroeconomic and labour market conditions for both male and female ratings. Male ratings are more likely to quit or separate due to a lack of promotion to higher ranks as compared with females. Male ratings are also more likely to quit as a result of a hectic operational tempo when compared with their female counterparts. Frequency of sea/shore deployments also seems to exert a significant effect with respect to quits and separation outcomes of both genders.

The RAN was undergoing a transitional period, which saw the service increasingly align with the United States Navy. This was a monumental shift in policy, as the Royal Navy had provided a model for the RAN to emulate since its creation in 1911. The Vietnam War offered a clear test of standardization and demonstrated that common ship designs provided a platform for interoperability, but did not guarantee it. The Australian ships were able to make a worthwhile contribution to a predominantly American naval effort, but they faced a number of challenges in achieving interoperability. The basis for successful co-operation was provided by the existence of common procedures and standardized equipment, but was necessarily supplemented by ad hoc measures and impromptu workarounds.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

In particular, it considers how steam propulsion made vessels utterly dependent on a particular resource – coal – and its distribution around the world. In doing so, it shows that the ‘coal question’ was central to imperial defence and the protection of trade, requiring the creation of infrastructures that spanned the globe. This infrastructure required careful management, and the processes involved show the development of bureaucracy and the reliance on the ‘contractor state’ to ensure this was both robust and able to allow swift mobilisation in war. The requirement to stop regularly at foreign stations also brought men of the Royal navy into contact with local coal heavers, as well as indigenous populations and landscapes. These encounters and their dissemination are crucial to our understanding of imperial relationships and imaginations at the height of the imperial age. ","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

The governance, control and accountability practices imposed upon pursers are analysed. The Regulations for accounting records to be kept by pursers indicate that accounting changed very little in the analysis period, until 1808, when it became substantially more detailed. Drawing on institutional theory, it is argued that this was due to external pressures for increased governance following the impeachment of Melville (First Lord of the Admiralty), public spending administrative and accounting reforms and political disapproval of ‘offices of profit’. The article provides important insights to the development of accounting, governance, audit and accountability within the Royal Navy, and enhances understanding of the historically unique role of pursers.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

Low fitness levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of injury and training attrition. To increase pass rates for Royal Navy (RN) Phase I training, a pre-joining fitness test (PJFT) was introduced (2.4 km treadmill best effort run). The PJFT was designed to identify candidates with poor levels of aerobic fitness who may be prone to leave training prematurely.
Aim: To examine the impact of the PJFT on training length and outcomes. Methods: Time taken to run 2.4 km and training outcomes were measured before and after the introduction of the PJFT. Information was collected from RN Phase I training establishments and the network of careers offices between 2002 and 2005. Recruits were placed into quartile groups based on 2.4 km overground running performance. The no PJFT and PJFT groups and the 2.4-km run performance quartiles were compared for training outcomes and time spent in training. Results: Training measures were available for 4818 recruits who entered training before the PJFT's introduction (no PJFT) and 3305 after its introduction (PJFT). The pass rate increased from 78 to 88% following the introduction of the PJFT (P < 0.01). The number of recruits applying for voluntary release decreased from 15% (no PJFT group) to 6% (PJFT group) (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: The PJFT positively impacted on RN Phase 1 training pass rates. A greater number of recruits successfully completed training, fewer applied for voluntary release and the number and length of training extensions were reduced.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

The complexities of British naval policy, operations, administration, technology and finance defy the tidy grouping of research into discrete chronological boundaries; in many ways the Navy’s contemporary history can best be seen as the cumulative effect of previous successes and failures of naval and defence policy. After all, the Royal Navy’s behaviour at the start of the second world war and during the interwar period cannot be fully understood without a clear comprehension of the first world war and the legacy of Jutland and submarine warfare. Yet at the same time, any analysis of the first world war is rooted in the administrative, strategic and technological changes made by Admiral Sir John Fisher during his time as First Sea Lord between 1904 and 1910, and the Fisher period and its navalism, competition andDreadnoughts cannot be fully understood without reference to the problems and concerns of the pre-Dreadnought era.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

This report reviews the potential solutions to this problem and concludes that only a method of actively cooling personnel will reduce heat strain and increase the number of people that can be processed through ships' NBC CS. Amongst the wide range of cooling equipment that might offer a benefit, only hand immersion in cold water and ice-vests are practically useful for use in NBC CS. To assess how effective these techniques are likely to be INM has modelled the thermal effects under environmental conditions expected in the CS when operating in a hot climate. The model predicted that hand immersion in cold water (10 degrees C) would be the most effective cooling method, providing that personnel were able to take regular rest periods to immerse the hands. If it is preferred that personnel in the CS be able to work continuously, then ice-vests would be effective. The safe total work time that can be achieved in a three hour period without a cooling intervention is approximately 72 minutes, regular rest periods must be taken throughout the three hour work period, to total of 108 minutes. Safe work times can be increased to 99 minutes by using an ice-vest and 117 minutes by using hand immersion in 10 degrees C water, with required rest times reduced accordingly, thereby increasing capacity of CS teams to decontaminate personnel.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

However, by the time of the Washington naval conference in late 1921, the League's polices had been radically changed. As a result, by the winter of 1921–2, the Navy League's leadership was focused on internal dissent and revolt, rather than on the impact of the Washington Naval Treaty.

When the subjects were allowed five minutes rest periods after every 10 minutes of work, the endurance of seven of the subjects was limited to between 75-105 minutes due to heat strain and heat illness. By the point of withdrawal mean (SD) rectal temperature (Tre) had risen by 1.8 degrees C (0.4 degree C). The other two subjects were withdrawn earlier because they reached cardiac safety limits. When the hands were immersed (HI) in 10 degrees C water during the five minute rest periods heat strain was significantly lower (P < 0.01) and work endurance times were increased. One subject was withdrawn early on reaching cardiac safety limits, two on reaching Tre limits (39 degrees C) at 105 minutes, and six subjects completed the 180 minute exposure with a final Tre of 38.4 degrees C (0.3 degree C). Using 'iced' (0 degree C) rather than 10 degrees C water for HI further reduced heat strain (P < 0.01) and increased endurance times. Three subjects were withdrawn early on reaching cardiac safety limits, the remaining six completing the 180 minute exposure, with a final Tre of 38.3 degrees C (0.5 degree C). Using an ice-vest (IV) in conjunction with HI further reduced heat strain (P < 0.01) and increased endurance times.

There were no reports of finger numbness or loss of dexterity due to HI, and all personnel were able to remove their own individual Protective Equipment (IPE) without difficulty. It is expected that using HI will not reduce the ability to decontaminate or undress others. The HI technique and IV equipment should be introduced into the Fleet. 'Iced' water should be used in preference to 10 degrees C, although any water colder than 25 degrees C will provide some benefit. The IVs increased torso girth and personnel should try them on (with frozen ice packs inserted) prior to their use and ensure that their protective clothing still fits, or obtain a larger size.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

The new hood was shown to provide excellent protection against the most severe flame engulfment to which RN personnel might accidentally be exposed. There was no evidence that the protection afforded by the hoods was reduced by prolonged use and washing and therefore it was safe for the “new-type” hood to remain in-service.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"
"Fuelling mobility: coal and Britain’s naval power, c. 1870–1914","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/fuelling-mobility-coal-and-britains-naval-power-c-18701914","Gray, S.","9 Jul 2017","This article considers the introduction of steam powered warships to the Royal Navy to show how oceanic mobility in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was contingent on the global availability, and consequently mobility, of coal. Whilst the introduction of steam technology may have freed warships from the vagaries of wind and tides, the navy was now chained not just to coaling stations, but also to the wider infrastructure which guaranteed coal’s movement to these stations around the globe. Thus, the ability to control both the source of the fuel and its movement was crucial to the mobility of British naval vessels tasked with protecting British interests worldwide, and was, therefore, central to British global power. This article explores how the navy ensured the availability of high quality steam-coal at British overseas stations, analysing the processes involved in sourcing high quality coal for naval ships and its transportation overseas. It also shows how the admiralty sought to make such arrangements more professional, and to guarantee the highest quality of coal at every station. It explores how these changes ensured that the infrastructure remained remarkably robust, despite its complex nature. It then assesses how Britain’s rivals failed to achieve the same control over fuelling in the age of the coal ship, offering Britain a huge advantage in the wider world. Finally, the paper considers the ramifications of Britain losing this advantage when it switched to oil. Overall, it argues that, although generally ignored, fuel, and particularly the ability to control its global movement, is crucial to understanding naval mobility. This, of course, is true not just in terms of the navy, but also applicable to other significant geopolitical contexts and processes.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

While human and cultural factors are only two pieces of the interoperability jigsaw they are of enduring significance. The cohesiveness of the relationship amongst the Royal Australian Navy, the Royal Navy and the United States Navy during the 2003 Iraq War was underpinned by high levels of perceptive interoperability, which manifested itself in effective working relationships. That conflict demonstrated that while historical ties provided a foundation for cooperation, a number of multinational initiatives were undertaken to further enhance interoperability. This article addresses how such a high level of perceptive interoperability was achieved by examining the conduct of multinational exercises, the importance of personnel exchanges and the role of liaison officers, before considering the effect it had on the conduct of operations. The Iraq War demonstrated that cultural factors are at least as important as other facets of interoperability.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

Britain and the United States were quick to express their sympathy and both offered to loan a ship to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) to offset their loss. The offers were genuine and were intended to aid an important partner. The RAN had been tied closely to the RN since its creation, but the 1950s and 1960s witnessed an important transition and the RAN’s decision to purchase the American designed and built Charles F. Adams class destroyer as its new class of escorts in 1961 exemplified an increasing alignment with the United States Navy (USN). The Voyager tragedy reignited the debate over standardization and afforded both the Royal Navy (RN) and USN with an opportunity to attempt to strengthen ties with the RAN. The eventual Australian decision to accept the British offer, ultimately, had little effect on the development of the RAN. Rather than harking back to a time when the RAN was an appendage of the RN, the decision to select the British ship was a mark of its increasing independence.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

The Anglo-Japanese Alliance presented some challenges to the received Edwardian racial hierarchy and the idea of British military supremacy. This article demonstrates how the ‘port town’ not only became a place of mediation where high-level international diplomacy mingled with the face-to-face experience of an alliance ‘in practice’, but also a space through which issues such as Otherness and imperial security were contested and explored.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

As such, coalition naval operations increasingly became the norm throughout the twentieth-century, and there is little sign of this abating in the twenty-first. Multinational operations provide a number of benefits, but they also present a number of challenges. Examining the dynamics of coalition operations involving the Royal Navy (RN), Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and the United States Navy (USN) during the Korean War, Vietnam War and the Iraq War, this book provides a broad overview of naval interoperability between the three navies. Using the naval gunfire support (NGS) capability as a lens through which to analyse operations, the study explores a diverse range of issues, including: command and control, communications, equipment standardisation, intelligence, logistics, planning, rules of engagement, tactics, techniques and procedures and training. Approaching the subject through both historical and contemporary perspectives not only provides a unique assessment of the variation in the effectiveness of interoperability over time, but also offers a platform for better understanding and enhancing the performance of future coalition naval operations. Based on extensive archival research in Australia, the UK and the US, as well as wide-ranging interviews, this book sheds new light on the dynamics of conducting coalition operations.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

From C3–5 AD, Portchester Castle, at the head of the harbour, operated as a Roman cross-Channel hub and provided national facilities for Classis Britannica. From c.1200, they were augmented by the Plantagenet galley dock on Portsea Island, and in 1495 superseded by the first permanent drydock. The Isle of Wight, invaded by the Danes in 998 and the French in 1340 and 1545, would became an essential naval defence: a militarised barrier and buffer. Henry VIII built St Helen’s bulwark on the island in 1539–45 to protect its anchorage and victualling facilities. In 1719, St Helen’s abandoned C13 church tower became the first seamark for Portsmouth’s eastern approach and the station to await a favourable wind. By the end of the C16, when Britain was trading and waging war beyond the continental shelf, the navy could access the Atlantic faster from the south coast than from the Rivers Thames and Medway. Despite advantageous C16/17 reports regarding operations and expeditions, Portsmouth had to combat metropolitan preferences and prejudices. By the mid-C17, however, the navy acknowledged Portsmouth’s superb natural assets and rebuilt its drydock in 1658. Thenceforth, the navy prioritised Portsmouth in technological innovations. The harbour, sheltered strategically and climatically by the Isle of Wight, could accommodate the fleet. Spithead anchorage, unsurpassed for assembly and supply, was the scene of spectacular fleet reviews, even during the 1797 Spithead Mutiny. Focusing on the late-C16 to early-C19, this chapter will explain how Portsmouth, Spithead and Saint Helen’s endured as a fortified seascape to support war.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

It deals with the formative period between 1939 and 1941 when the Fleet Air Arm tried to recover from the impact of dual control and economic stringencies during the inter-war period while conducting a wide range of operations. There is in depth coverage of significant operations including the Norwegian campaign, Mediterrranean actions such as the attack on the Italian Fleet at Taranto and the Battle of Cape Matapan, and the torpedo attacks on the German battleship Bismarck. Incidents involving the loss of and damage to aircraft carriers, including the sinking of Ark Royal, one of the most famous ships in the early years of World War Two, are also reported. Of major importance are key planning and policy issues. These include the requirements for aircraft carriers, the evolving debate regarding the necessary types of aircraft and attempts to provide sufficient facilities ashore for naval air squadrons. A wide range of official documents are used to enable the reader to appreciate the complexity of the operations and other issues which faced the Fleet Air Arm. This volume will appeal to everyone interested in how the Royal Navy adapted to the use of air power in the Second World War. Its reports bring actions vividly to life. Its correspondence demonstrates the fundamental foundation of planning, policy and logistics.

dependent on coal. Getting this coal aboard warships was dirty, exhausting, and dangerous
work. Even in 1914, it was still largely done by hand and, increasingly, it was the job of the
ships’ crews to perform this task. Thus coaling was a regular task for sailors, usually occurring
every 7–10 days, and one that could last all day. This article examines the different methods of
coaling warships, particularly focusing on the use of sailor labour and colliers to reflect their
increasing use as the period progressed. In addition to examining the roles of each of the ships’
crew in coaling, it also assesses sailors’ attitudes towards the task. In doing so, it shows that such
a hated job required coping mechanisms, such as fancy dress, music, and competition, as well as
the promise of alcohol and shore leave afterwards. Finally, the article examines the dangers of
coaling, showing that a regular need for fuel frequently exposed sailors to serious danger, often
suffering broken bones and, all too frequently, death.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

Lacking indigenous sources of sufficiently high quality, Argentina and Brazil in particular came to rely heavily on Welsh coal for their energy needs. While playing a crucial role in the economic development of such countries, Welsh coal and its distribution network of coaling stations also helped in protecting the trade between Britain and South America, allowing the Royal Navy to have access to the most suitable coal for its purposes at distances varying from almost 4,000 to 10,000 miles from its point of origin. This paper explores various aspects of the development of this trade and argues that, in discussions of the development of the informal empire, the significance of (Welsh) coal should not be overlooked, as has tended to be the case in some modern works.","Navy","University of Portsmouth"

To address this knowledge gap, this work-in-progress paper aims to develop a conceptual framework on factors affecting the managers’ perceived roles of AI in their information processing and their intention to use AI. Underpinned by the relevant theories of information processing, the research framework can be used to examine if and to what extent the situational, personal, and performative factors of information systems (IS) influence the managers’ perception of AI-based applications in terms of preferred human-AI collaboration modes and levels of AI input in information processing activities. The proposed framework offers a theoretical understanding and development of AI-based applications in the context of information processing from an end user’s perspective.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"

Generally, study of the kinetics of GH formation will help to better understand this process in order to control it favorably. However, due to its complexity, this process is not fully understood yet. More studies in the literature are considering the thermodynamics of gas hydrate formation both experimentally and mathematically. However, there is no sufficient studies regarding the kinetics of gas hydrates and most of the experimental data and specifically the kinetic models in the literature are incomplete. That may be due to inherent stochastic behavior of GHs which makes it difficult to develop a deterministic model for it. Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods including Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) have been proved as a novel and potential tools with acceptable accuracy for modeling of engineering systems. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the kinetics of gas hydrate formation using ANN and ANFIS when the relation between growth rate of methane hydrate, temperature and pressure has been modeled. Moreover, this can also be achieved using complicated governing equations but AI provides a less complex and easier way to accomplish this goal. Experimental data considering the methane hydrate growth rate as a function of pressure and temperature were used and ANFIS as well as ANN were employed to duplicate them. In this study, the results reveal that ANIFS could better predict the methane hydrate growth rate in the prevailing pressure and temperature conditions compared to ANN. Generally this study shows the effectiveness of AI based techniques for kinetics modeling of gas hydrates formation.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"

Traditional means of species identification and taxonomy of this group encounter numerous challenges, often compounded by the diverse and dynamic nature of shipworm ecology and distribution. Modern integrative taxonomic methods are shedding new light on this complex group, from delineating cryptic species to resolving phylogenetic relationships within the family. This study reported new sequence data from shipworm species rafted from the western to eastern Pacific Ocean in woody marine debris resulting from the Japanese tsunami of 2011. Eight species of shipworms were found in this debris and tissue from five species was collected. Partial nuclear ribosomal 18S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from Bankia bipennata (Turton, 1819), Bankia carinata (Gray, 1827), Psiloteredo sp., Teredora princesae (Sivickis, 1928), and Teredothyra smithi (Bartsch, 1927). A 658 base pair fragment of COI was successfully sequenced from Psiloteredo sp. and T. princesae specimens from tsunami debris, as well as Psiloteredo megotara (Hanley, 1848) from Europe and Nototeredo norvagica (Spangler, 1792) from Scandinavia. Psiloteredo sp. is very similar morphologically to the North Atlantic Ocean P. megotara; however, these two species are genetically distinct with a 12.8% K2P distance in their COI sequences. The transport of shipworms across the North Pacific Ocean in woody debris generated by a tsunami shows that major geologic events can connect previously isolated geographic areas and provide the opportunity for the establishment of invasive species and subsequent speciation.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"

Lumber and other wood began appearing on Central Pacific (Hawaiian Islands) and Eastern Pacific beaches in 2013. Eighty pieces of wood Japanese Tsunami Marine Debris (JTMD) consisting of construction beams, trees, milled logs, and wood from vessels or maritime structures were analyzed. Six shipworm species resident in the coastal waters of Japan were found: Bankia bipennata (Turton, 1819), Bankia carinata (Gray, 1827), Teredothyra smithi (Bartsch, 1927), Psiloteredo sp., Lyrodus takanoshimensis (Roch, 1929), and Teredo navalis Linnaeus, 1758. Two pelagic species, Teredora princesae (Sivickis, 1928) and Uperotus clava (Gmelin, 1791), were acquired by JTMD wood in the transoceanic voyage.

E.; Hu, Y.; Copp, G. H.","Mar 2022","Plasticity in growth and life-history traits is an important attribute of non-native (NN) fishes, facilitating their adaptation to novel environments. Few studies have investigated geographical variations in multiple biological traits and the factors affecting the variations. In this study, variations in multiple biological traits of NN Pterygoplichthys spp. were investigated in the main river basins of the Guangdong and Hainan provinces of South China. The impacts of environmental factors on the biological traits were analysed using general linear modeling and an information-theoretic approach. Among-basin differences in population growth was observed, with richness of competitor fishes negatively affecting growth, maturity and reproductive traits – this suggests biotic resistance was mediated by competition with native fishes. These traits were positively affected by total phosphorus concentration, which is indicative of bottom-up effects, mediated by inorganic nutrients, potentially playing an important role in the invasion success of NN fish. In population level, a bet-hedging strategy was observed in Pterygoplichthys spp. under unfavourable environment conditions (e.g. Nangdujiang), whereas a ‘master-of-some’strategy was found under favourable conditions (e.g. Pearl River Delta and Western Basin). The results suggested that plasticity in multiple biological traits of Pterygoplichthys spp. is an important strategy to overcome changing environmental conditions in different rivers, and habitat-specific variations across river basins would reflect trade-offs amongst traits at the population level. Therefore, habitat-specific management measures, adapted to the invaded ecosystem’s features and the life-history strategy of the NN species, could provide an effective means to control invasive species.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"

This review provides a comprehensive literature survey on AI-MOO employed in the PEMFC field. Firstly, AI-MOO were introduced in detail, including the definition, categories and framework. Then the objectives, intelligent algorithms and trade-off methods commonly used in PEMFC were tabularised and evaluated. The application of AI-MOO in PEMFC was summarised systematically based on the application areas, including the PEMFC components, kinetics and thermodynamics, control and monitoring systems, the overall performance, and the hybrid systems. The related studies were tabularised and discussed, especially algorithms, variables, objectives and optimisation results.

This is why we see teams of highly specialised engineers in industries such as aerospace, nuclear and subsurface. Condition based monitoring is also employed to maximise the efficiency of extensive maintenance programmes instead of using periodic maintenance. A level of automation is often required in such complex engineering platforms in order to effectively and safely manage them. Advances in Artificial Intelligence related technologies have offered greater levels of automation but this potentially pivots the weight of decision making away from the operator to the machine. Implementing AI or complex algorithms into a platform can mean that the Operators’ control over the system is diminished or removed altogether. For example, in the Boeing 737 Air Max Disaster, AI had been added to a platform and removed the operators’ control of the system. This meant that the operator could not then move outside the extremely reserved, algorithm defined, “envelope” of operation. This paper analyses the challenges of AI driven condition based monitoring where there is a potential to see similar consequences to those seen in control engineering. As the future of society becomes more about algorithm driven technology, it is prudent to ask, not only whether we should implement AI into complex systems, but how this can be achieved ethically and safely in order to reduce risk to life.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"

"Understanding the challenges and perceived roles of artificial intelligence in information processing by UK managers","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/understanding-the-challenges-and-perceived-roles-of-artificial-in","Xu, M.; Duan, Y.; Cao, G.; Ong, V.; Dietzmann, C.","1 Sept 2022","With the availability of advanced digital technologies, organisations are collecting data in the form of big data which is widely available in large volume, high velocity, and complex variety. As a result, it is vital for business managers to acquire knowledge from data and information processing in order to make informed decisions and performing their roles effectively and efficiently. However, managers face significant challenges in data and information processing, which includes acquiring, analysing, and making sense of big data, due to the volume, variety, velocity and veracity of big data. It is argued that the new development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the great potential in supporting and/or replacing managers’ information processing activities. However, there is very limited research on understanding the applications of AI in information processing from a business manager’s perspective. This paper reports an empirical investigation that aims to address this knowledge gap. The study focuses on investigate data and information processing challenges in the era of big data faced by business managers and their perceptions on the role AI in information processing. To achieve the research aim, a large questionnaire survey is used to collect data with UK business managers. The paper will report the key findings on the identified challenges, the managers perceived role of AI in the information processing process and their willingness to use AI in assisting their information processing activities. The paper will highlight the important implication of the findings for research and practice.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"
"The use of artificial intelligence and audit quality: an analysis from the perspectives of external auditors in the UAE","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/the-use-of-artificial-intelligence-and-audit-quality-an-analysis-","Noordin, N. A.; Hussainey, K.; Hayek, A. F.","31 Jul 2022","This paper aims to explore external auditors’ perception of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It investigates whether there is a perception among external auditors toward the contribution of AI to audit quality. It also aims to test whether the perception of AI usage and its impact on audit quality differs between local and international external auditors. Data were collected using an online survey from 22 local and 41 international audit firms to achieve these research objectives. Participants were either the auditing manager, audit partners, senior auditors or other personnel who may have experience in the field of accounting and auditing. To test our hypotheses, data analysis was undertaken using reliability and validity tests, descriptive analysis and independent samples t-test. We found that the analysis shows that there is a non-significant difference in the perceived contribution of AI to audit quality between local and international audit firms. All the audit firms, whether local or international, have equal perceived contributions with regard to the audit quality.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"

The Laidlaw report was commissioned after failings during the Inter City West Coast Rail Franchise procurement that led to a legal challenge of the models used within the exercise. The Macpherson review looked into the quality assurance of Government analytical models in the context of the experience with the Intercity West Coast franchise competition. This paper examines what progress, if any, has been made in the 8 years since the Laidlaw report in model building and best practise in government, and proposes several recommendations for ways forward.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"

M.; Marinescu, M.; Wu, B.; Richardson, G.","19 Jul 2022","Physics-based electrochemical battery models derived from porous electrode theory are a very powerful tool for understanding lithium-ion batteries, as well as for improving their design and management. Different model fidelity, and thus model complexity, is needed for different applications. For example, in battery design we can afford longer computational times and the use of powerful computers, while for real-time battery control (e.g. in electric vehicles) we need to perform very fast calculations using simple devices. For this reason, simplified models that retain most of the features at a lower computational cost are widely used. Even though in the literature we often find these simplified models posed independently, leading to inconsistencies between models, they can actually be derived from more complicated models using a unified and systematic framework. In this review, we showcase this reductive framework, starting from a high-fidelity microscale model and reducing it all the way down to the single particle model, deriving in the process other common models, such as the Doyle–Fuller–Newman model. We also provide a critical discussion on the advantages and shortcomings of each of the models, which can aid model selection for a particular application. Finally, we provide an overview of possible extensions to the models, with a special focus on thermal models. Any of these extensions could be incorporated into the microscale model and the reductive framework re-applied to lead to a new generation of simplified, multi-physics models.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"
"The illusion of routine as an indicator for job automation with artificial intelligence","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/the-illusion-of-routine-as-an-indicator-for-job-automation-with-a","Bissessur, J.; Arabikhan, F.; Bednar, P.","Aug 2019","The resurgence of artificial intelligence (AI) has empowered organizations to concentrate their research efforts on enhancing decision-making and automation capabilities. This is being pursued with the goal of increasing productivity, whilst reducing costs. With this, it is perceived that the jobs within these organizations that are considered subject to ‘routine’, or repetitive and mundane tasks, are more likely to be automatable. However, it may be recognised that these jobs are more than a simple set of routine tasks. This study aims to address the concept of routineness from the perspective of the job occupants themselves. The findings reveal that jobs which are considered routine from an organizational perspective, realistically require a degree of human intervention. This suggests that the fear of mass unemployment at the hands of AI may be an unrealistic notion. Rather, the introduction of AI into jobs paves the way for collaborative methods of working which could augment current jobs and create new jobs. Furthermore, this paper accentuates that the acceptance of AI by stakeholders requires an alignment of the technology with their own unique contextual needs.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"
"Emergent perception and video games that listen: applying sonic virtuality for creative and intelligent NPC behaviours","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/emergent-perception-and-video-games-that-listen-applying-sonic-vi","Garner, T. A.; Jordanous, A.","27 Jun 2016","‘Non-player characters (NPCs)’ can present well-crafted behaviours and evoke engaging and immersive playerexperiences but such behaviour in current NPCs is illusory and only achievable within a controlled and linear/fixed video game context. NPCs struggle greatly to portray flexible or creative behaviours within an adaptive or procedurally generated environment and this is even more apparent in their relationship with sound. This paper posits that recent theoretical developments in cognitive psychology offer significant opportunity to advance NPC-AI and proposes that an intelligence framework, based upon Sonic Virtuality and integrated within an NPC, would offer distinct advantages over current systems. To illustrate this vision, a roadmap for future work is laid out using Sonic Virtuality as the foundation for a ‘synthetic listener’; an NPC capable of responding to procedurally generated and external (player-domain) audio. As a philosophical exploration, underlying principles are considered for other perception modalities, presenting an avenue of games-AI research that, ultimately, could dramatically improve NPC- ‘humanness’ and evoke a player-immersion and presence equivalent to linear/fixed AI but in much bigger, more complex virtual worlds.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"

"Generic learning materials: developing academic integrity in your students","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/generic-learning-materials-developing-academic-integrity-in-your-","Durham, H.; Leung, S.; DiBiase, D.","2009","Academic integrity (AI) is of relevance across all academic disciplines, both from the perspective of the educator and the student. From the former perspective there is the need to increase the awareness of AI amongst the student population whilst monitoring and enforcing the rules and regulation regarding plagiarism within their institution. On the other hand, students need a full appreciation of the importance of AI and a clear recognition of the penalties for flouting the regulations in order to steer a successful passage through higher education and on into their professional career. By repurposing learning materials originally developed by the Pennsylvania State University (USA), the Universities of Southampton and Leeds (UK) have developed academic integrity guidelines to support students in their studies and provide an assessment of their understanding of AI concepts. This chapter describes the development of these learning activities and examines the technical and content issues of repurposing materials for three different institutions. It also reflects on the success of embedding the guidelines and assessment in geography programmes at two UK universities, examines the effect of using the online plagiarism detection service, Turnitin, to police plagiarism cases and summaries the lessons learnt in helping geography students to enhance their study skills.

"Circadian long call distribution in wild orangutans","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/circadian-long-call-distribution-in-wild-orangutans","Davila-Ross, M.; Geissmann, T.","2009","We present first data on circadian long call distribution of wild orangutans in Northwest Borneo. Data were collected during two months in Batang Ai National Park. A total of 151 male long calls were heard, exhibiting a bimodal distribution pattern with peaks at 05:00-06:00 hours and 18:00-19:00 hours. An earlier study found pronounced differences between the calling rates of Bornean orangutans, which showed an almost unimodal call distribution with its peak at mid-morning, and those of Sumatran orangutans, which showed a bimodal call distribution with a distinct calling peak at predawn and a more moderate peak near dusk (MacKinnon 1974). Our findings from Batang Ai resemble more closely the pattern reported for Sumatra than those reported for other Bornean localities and, therefore, contradict earlier reports suggesting a Sumatra-Borneo dichotomy in orangutan call distribution. In addition, orangutans in Batang Ai were heard to regularly emit long calls throughout the night. This behaviour is unusual for a diurnal species.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"

There are various frameworks and conceptual journeys one should take to ensure a robust AI product; context is one of the vital parts of this. AI is now expected to make decisions, from deciding who gets a credit card to cancer diagnosis. These decisions affect most, if not all, of society. As developers if we do not understand or use fundamental modelling principles then we can cause real harm to society. Recently more serious effects of AI have been observed. Dehumanisation is the human reaction to overused anthropomorphism and lack of social contact caused by excessive interaction with, or addiction to, technology. This can cause humans to devalue technology and to devalue other humans. This is a contradiction of the use of ‘social robots’ and ‘chatbots’, indicating that the negative effects of this technology would outweigh any perceived positive effects. Also, within cyberspace, anthropomorphism and similar techniques based on deep philosophical principles can, and are, being used to alter the behaviour of humans. These techniques are used to manipulate human behaviours at a basic level in the human mind. As these types of techniques are becoming more widespread, it is clear that we are entering unchartered territory that holds a vast array of consequences for society.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"

E.; Fujii, T.; Sumida, M.","29 Jul 2015","The Western clawed frog, Xenopus tropicalis, is a highly promising model amphibian, especially in developmental and physiological research, and as a tool for understanding disease. It was originally found in the West African rainforest belt, and was introduced to the research community in the 1990s. The major strains thus far known include the Nigerian and Ivory Coast strains. However, due to its short history as an experimental animal, the genetic relationship among the various strains has not yet been clarified, and establishment of inbred strains has not yet been achieved. Since 2003 the Institute for Amphibian Biology (IAB), Hiroshima University has maintained stocks of multiple X. tropicalis strains and conducted consecutive breeding as part of the National BioResource Project. In the present study we investigated the inbreeding ratio and genetic relationship of four inbred strains at IAB, as well as stocks from other institutions, using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and mitochondrial haplotypes. Our results show successive reduction of heterozygosity in the genome of the IAB inbred strains. The Ivory Coast strains clearly differed from the Nigerian strains genetically, and three subgroups were identified within both the Nigerian and Ivory Coast strains. It is noteworthy that the Ivory Coast strains have an evolutionary divergent genetic background. Our results serve as a guide for the most effective use of X. tropicalis strains, and the long-term maintenance of multiple strains will contribute to further research efforts.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"

Heat-shock 70-kDa protein 8 (HSPA8), found within the oviduct, prolongs boar, ram and bull sperm survival at body temperatures in vitro. Here, we aimed to determine whether supplementing extenders (INRA-96 and RSD-1) with HSPA8 (4 µg mL–1) would improve their performance in maintaining freshly collected ram sperm viability and sperm nuclear DNA integrity during storage over 48 h at 17°C. Sperm function was assessed at 1, 6, 24 and 48 h and this experiment was repeated using 25 × 106 and 800 × 106 spermatozoa mL–1. INRA96 supplemented with HSPA8 maintained sperm viability significantly better than INRA96 alone at both sperm concentrations. However, sperm nuclear DNA fragmentation (DF) increased significantly during storage using the higher sperm concentration, irrespective of the extender and the protein treatment used. Increasing levels of sperm nuclear DF over time could explain why poor fertility rates are often observed following cervical AI using stored ram semen. However, further research is required to ascertain whether supplementing the commercially available INRA96 extender with HSPA8 will improve fertility rates following cervical AI using stored ram semen.","Ai","University of Portsmouth"
