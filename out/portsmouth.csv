"Towards a theory of small-firm low-tech food innovation","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/towards-a-theory-of-small-firm-low-tech-food-innovation","Vyas, V.; Vyas, R.","14 Aug 2014","Innovation in low-tech sectors such as food & drinks continues to be under-researched and under-theorised despite growing evidence on low and medium technology sectors’ substantial contribution to economic growth in the developed countries. This attempt to build theory from case study research, contributes to an embryonic literature in this area through a set of propositions grounded in process theory and organisational innovativeness literature. We postulate that small firm food innovation is shaped exogenously by the cultural context of food consumption and internally by high-variety-low-volume manufacturing environment of the innovative firm. The ensuing incremental innovation is underpinned by a counterintuitive avoidance of development of health foods. These innovative efforts are abetted by the large retailers who, in turn, use these agile enterprises’ creativity and plasticity to achieve their own competitive goals. The propositions outlined here complement the extant theory through a sharper contextual focus in contrast to the previous research.","Tech","University of Manchester"

As a giant Ariadne’s thread, these bent metal structures help to better orientate the users around the campus. At the same time, the project aims to link the existing network of faculties, emphasising their interdisciplinary nature and thus creating a unique system. The landmarks evoke a thread that, with simple structures, emerge from the ground and stitch together the most important places on the university campus. Only the central landmark is more complex and iconic, since it represents the beginning and the end point of the thread, and it is placed in the central university quad.The design was carried out in collaboration with Korea Tech and a group of students in order to develop the idea and to further implement the detailed design. The process was thus an experiment of practical and educational design, with concepts that bridge art, architecture, and urbanism. The structures have enhanced the quality of the public space and helped to create a sense of appropriation from the users.","Tech","University of Manchester"

The focus of such studies remains high-technology enterprises, which continue to attract both academic and popular interest, oblivious to the innovative endeavours of people in traditional low-tech industries. This book attempts to address this imbalance through a comprehensive analysis of innovation in this largely neglected area. Based on case studies of seven small innovative food companies, this book presents an in-depth analysis of innovation in the Scottish food and drinks industry and unravels a lesser-known approach to effective low-cost product innovation, which is simple and economical, yet elegant and successful. Using careful data collection and rigorous statistical testing, the analysis and findings in this book address a wide spectrum of interests: academics in business schools, policy makers in governments and executives and entrepreneurs in food and other low-technology sectors.

"Industry-academia linkages in a high tech research field","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/industry-academia-linkages-in-a-high-tech-research-field","Ozcan, S.; Islam, N.","24 Sept 2015","Currently academic researches' focus started changing towards protecting IP rights and to transferring them into industrial actors. Accordingly, it is argued that academic's basic research focus started shifting towards applied research as it is essential for the radical inventions to be introduced in a competitive market. This research seeks to understand industry-academia linkages in a high tech field such as nano-crystals. In regards to supporting the technology transfer process within or cross country, this study illustrates the technology development trends and actors' engagement; nano-crystals technology and their interconnections; and maps the organisational (industry-academia) linkages that enhance the commercialisation of radical inventions. The results show that the industry-academia linkages that appeared as decentralized structure are more stable compared to other linkage types. Korean and Japanese organisations present such stable linkages. The linkages are even stronger when they appear as a mono-linkage type. Chinese organisations show a great illustration of such an effective mono-linkage of co-inventorships in high tech research field. The organisations in the US maintain international linkages.","Tech","University of Manchester"

"Survival and growth of high-tech SMEs: some uncommon strategies","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/survival-and-growth-of-high-tech-smes-some-uncommon-strategies","Vyas, V.","2009","Innovation, by its very nature, disrupts the equilibrium of a competitive market and causes uncertainty. To confront it, the enterprise must innovate further. This competition driven innovation (Cantner et al., 2004), which is central to technical progress and responsible for keeping large corporations vibrant, however, creates peculiar difficulties for the new firm. As R&D budgets burgeon and technical change accelerates, innovation becomes even more focused and competitive. Markets take unanticipated paths hammered by the onslaught of innovators. New products spring up and disappear before people have a chance to look at them and the inventors have time to exploit the gains of their creation. The scale of creative destruction wrought by entrepreneurs trying to break into rival markets using innovative edge of their products and processes has been, of late, growing increasingly discomforting. No wonder, the closure rates are mounting and the steady advancements in knowledge continue to leave behind entrepreneurial mass graves. It seems, the new enterprise in the next century is going to awaken to a competitive reality that is both overwhelming and scary. Entrepreneurs everywhere are now facing the classic Schumpeterian competition, the one that strikes not at the margin of profits and output, but at their very lives. Though the technical innovations of the past decades have opened up a whole gamut of opportunities for start-ups, they have also, sharpened the edge of competition and have increased its ability to mop down the relatively inefficient. As efficiency standards rise, survival becomes increasingly difficult for new enterprises. Effective management and exploitation of change of this magnitude and complexity is extremely difficult. Under such intense uncertainty, there seems to be no guarantee of payoffs from any programme to improve technology (Metcalfe, 1997).","Tech","University of Manchester"
"Promoting road safety","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/promoting-road-safety","Esbester, M. O.","Apr 2015","This article is among the first historical considerations of road safety in Africa. It argues that race and class, as colonial dualisms, analytically frame two defining moments in the development of African automobility and its infrastructure—“Africanization” in the first decade of Kenya’s political independence from Britain, 1963–75, and democratization in postapartheid South Africa. We argue that recent road safety interventions in both countries exemplify an “epidemiological turn” influenced by public health constructions of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. African states’ framing of road safety in behaviorist terms has obscured larger debates around redressing the historical legacies of racialized access to roads and the technopolitics of African automobility. Civic involvement in road safety initiatives has tended to be limited, although the specter of road carnage has entered into the public imagination, largely through the death of high profile Africans. However, some African road users continue to pursue alternative, and often culturally embedded, strategies to mitigate the dangers posed by life “on the road.”","Tech","University of Manchester"

But within this phenomenological umbrella, attention is now being focussed upon the policing of 'hi-tech crime'. This policy intervention again underlines the importance of an understanding of the new international policy networks, their transnational dynamics of governance, and the democratic opportunities for intervention in the policy process. The paper will first outline the development of the policy networks on organised crime within the European Union and G8. Second, by focussing upon the development of policies on hi-tech crime within three international fora, the paper will underline the apparent importance of 'infrastructural power' in ensuring that the policing of hi-tech crime is translated to the law enforcement agenda.","Tech","University of Manchester"

It investigates a) the motives behind SMEs’ coopetition b) coopetitive benefits for SMEs and for the market c) the coopetition success’ barriers. Using qualitative methods, we find that i) coopetitive SMEs pursue rent-gaining strategies with reduced financial risk, and are able to improve the market ii) motives relate to financial risk reduction and performance improvement iii) coopetitive SMEs accessed resources, improved quality, enabled economies of scale and knowledge diffusion in the industry iv) lack of trust or overtrusting can limit coopetition’s success v) geographical proximity is important practically or for strategic positioning. The majority of coopetition research focused on large enterprises in technological-intensive industries. We contribute to the understanding of the transferability of coopetition theory outside its traditional context, by bringing evidence of coopetition strategies between SMEs belonging to an alternative, fast growing and highly coopetitive industry.

"Supply chain drivers, partnerships and performance of high-tech SMEs: An empirical study using SEM","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/supply-chain-drivers-partnerships-and-performance-of-high-tech-sm","Rezaei, J.; Trott, P.; Ortt, R.","23 Mar 2018","Purpose – In this study, high-tech small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SME) supply chain partnerships are examined. Partnerships are considered at the level of business function rather than the entire organisation. Secondly, the drivers of SMEs to engage in partnerships are assessed to see whether functions engage in partnerships for different reasons. Thirdly, performance per function is assessed to see the differential effect of partnerships on the function’s performance. 

Design/methodology/approach – In this study, the relationship between the drivers of SMEs to engage in partnerships, four types of partnerships (marketing and sales, R&D, purchasing and logistics, and production) and four types of functional performances of firms (marketing and sales, R&D, purchasing and logistics, and production) are examined. The data has been collected from 279 SMEs. The proposed hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). 

Findings – The results indicate that there are considerable differences between business functions in terms of the degree of involvement in partnerships and the effect of partnerships on the performance of these functions. This paper contributes to research by explaining the contradictory results of partnerships on SMEs performance.

 Practical implications – This study helps firms understand (i) which type of partnership should be stablished based on the firm’s drivers to engage in supply chain partnership; and (ii) which partnership has a significant effect of which type of business performance of the firm.

 Originality/value – The originality of this study is to investigate the relationship between different drivers to engage in supply chain partnership and different types of partnerships and different functional performance of firm in a single model. ","Tech","University of Manchester"

M.","Apr 2015","This special issue of Technology and Culture explores the ways in which road use and road safety have changed since the 1880s, including how different road users interacted with each other, technology, regulation, engineering, design, and the built environment. Together the articles provide a look at a variety of approaches across North America, Europe, and Africa and at different road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers. While most of the papers individually consider a single national example, the picture that is built up across the issue allows comparisons between countries to demonstrate how road safety and automobility technologies are historically and culturally contingent. The issue concludes with a commentary from a prominent policymaker in the hope that better understanding of how accidents, safety, and risks are co-constructed and co-produced can offer insights into how we might reduce deaths and injuries in the future.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Further, it analyses two case studies related to aspects of security and safety: the Virginia Tech Shooting in 2007 and the Lion Air 610 crash in 2018. Both case studies address the concept of learning from failures. In doing so, an analysis of the root causes and vulnerabilities through the methods of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) is conducted to identify lessons to be learned. Results: Findings are intended to stimulate organisational learning and improve organisational processes to mitigate disasters from happening again. Conclusion: The value of this study is that aspects of learning and unlearning from failures have been identified for the cases used. Expectation for future studies is to extend the proposed methodology to other cases in the fields of surveillance, security and safety. ","Tech","University of Manchester"

P.; Chen, J.; Jin, Q.; Liu, W.","3 Dec 2020","This paper presents experimental and analytical studies on flexural behavior of slab-rib integrated Sandwich composite decks. The influences of layers of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) facesheets, foam densities, and the existence of webs and cross beams are discussed herein. The test results showed that the existence of vertical webs remarkably improved the debonding of the facesheets from the foam core, thus increasing the ultimate load by 59% compared with the specimens without webs. However, the existence of horizontal webs has insignificant effect on the failure mode and ultimate load. Increasing the number of layers of GFRP facesheets from 2 to 4 and 6 results in 100% and 214% increments in ultimate loads, respectively, while the specimen with lower density of foam had a higher ultimate load than the specimen with higher density of foam due to deformation compatibility between GFRP skins and foam core with low density. The analysis software Abaqus Explicit was used to simulate the flexural behavior of test specimens, and the numerical results agreed well with the test data. The verified finite element model was extended to analyze the influences of the number of GFRP layers on the top of decks and the height of vertical webs. Based on equivalent method and compatibility of shear deformation, the flexural and shear rigidities were estimated. Then, analytical solution for displacement of the slab-rib integrated Sandwich composite decks subjected to four-point load was derived out. Comparison of analytical and experimental results shows that the displacements can be precisely predicted by the present theoretical model.","Tech","University of Manchester"
"Innovation and new product development in SMEs: an investigation of Scottish food industry","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/innovation-and-new-product-development-in-smes-an-investigation-o","Vyas, V.; Masson, R.; Laing, S.; Craig, A.","2007","Innovation is one of the most reported determinants of business success. Much of research on business innovation, however, is focussed on high-tech sectors and innovation studies of low-tech businesses are rare. This paper reporting a doctoral research on innovation in Scottish food industry attempts to address this lacuna. Another impetus for this study stems from the fact that though Scotland has historically been at the vanguard of scientific, industrial and business innovations, it has legged behind recently and has consequently become one of the less competitive regions within Europe. This study of innovation in one of Scotland’s major industries is thus both interesting and relevant. This paper reports results of semi-structured personal interviews and personality tests of innovativeness of key decision makers in 8 Scottish food companies known for innovation. The results show that the personality of people responsible for new product development plays a significant role in giving a business its innovative proclivity. Innovative food companies in Scotland follow an analogous process of idea generation, validation, implementation and full product deployment with some minor, though, significant departures. Innovators in Scottish food industry consider packaging innovation an inseparable part of product innovation. They, however, largely shun creation of healthier versions of foods, as an innovation option.  A major finding of this study -supermarkets as the main drivers of innovation in Scottish food industry- is a revelation and raises need to revisit their role in regeneration of regional economies.

"Axial compressive behavior and energy absorption of syntactic foam-filled GFRP tubes with lattice frame reinforcement","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/axial-compressive-behavior-and-energy-absorption-of-syntactic-foa","Jin, Q.; Wang, J.; Chen, J.; Bao, F.","1 Nov 2022","A kind of innovative foam-filled glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) tube with lattice frame reinforcement was proposed for improving energy absorption capacity. The crushing experimental results revealed that lattice frame reinforcement contributed to increasing compressive strength and energy absorption, by ∼33 and 90%, respectively, for syntactic foam-filled GFRP tubes and their plateau stress almost increased to peak strength. Decreasing distances between transverse or vertical bars resulted in increasing energy absorption in composite columns with GFRP shells. The effects of lattice frames on the mechanical behaviors of composite columns without GFRP shells was less significant compared to columns with shells. Under the same content in foam cores, the energy absorption ability of syntactic foam-filled GFRP tubes with lattice frame reinforcement was much higher than that of specimens reinforced by MWCNTs. In addition, an analytical model considering the local buckling of lattice frames was proposed to predict the ultimate crushing load of composite columns with reinforcement. The analytical solutions agreed well with experimental results. This study provided a promising approach for designing a lightweight composite column with a high capacity for energy absorption, which could be used as an energy absorption member in engineering structures.","Tech","University of Manchester"

The impact test results showed that the penetration depth of GFRP panels with synthetic foam is much smaller than that of bare synthetic foam panels. The edgewise compression test results indicated the facesheet debonding dominates the failure mode of the sandwich panels without lattice webs, while the failure mode of the sandwich panels with lattice webs is predominated by the wrinkling and delamination of the facesheets and the crushing of foam core. The influences of applied impact energy, GFRP lay-up, synthetic foam density and the existence of webs on the impact and post impact behavior of sandwich panels are discussed herein. Analytical models are proposed to predict the residual ultimate edgewise compressive load capacity of sandwich panels with lattice webs after impacts, using energy principles and variational methods in applied mechanics. The influences from impact damage, the local buckling of the facesheets and the confined strength of the foam core are measured and compared well with proposed analytical models.","Tech","University of Manchester"

In particular, this paper presents the development of an integrated model, which links a regional economics social accounting matrix (SAM) model to an ecological model constructed using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software. The impacts on the ecological–economics–social system are examined by varying fishing efforts for four scenarios, including status quo management, fishing effort reduction policy, fishing gear switch policy, and summer closure extension policy. Key results from the predictions (2010-2020) and policy simulations illustrate that the collapse effect is apparent in the status quo scenario. Further, reducing or switching of fishing effort (e.g. elimination of overfishing and reduced habitat disturbance) positively affects the ecosystem and can lead to economic and social welfare gains in the PRE’s economy. The gear switch scenario presents a compromise among the economics, social, and conservation metrics, and also outperforms other scenarios in terms of biomass at the end of the simulation period. The fishing effort reduction policy performs better than the summer closure extension policy in terms of the conservation metrics but does relatively poorly in economic terms.","Tech","University of Manchester"

The paper proposes a computable general equilibrium model that can evaluate changes in the economic and social indicators. This model is connected to an Ecopath with Ecosim model that can simulate the dynamics of an ecosystem. The integrated model is constructed to investigate how different scenarios of fishing effort and catch management reflecting varying levels of input and output in four fishery management simulations result in different states of the socio-economic and ecosystem structure. Four alterative fishing management scenarios are defined, namely: (1) fishing intensity and policies maintain the status quo; (2) fishing vessel reduction is implemented as an input control policy; (3) fishermen are required to transfer to others jobs as an input control policy; and (4) total landing reduction is implemented as an output control policy. The modelling results show that the output control policy has the most positive effect on ecosystem restoration and can increase overall social welfare. The fishermen switching policy leads to the most positive increase in economic indicators, whereas the policy of fishing vessels reduction has a positive effect on ecosystem restoration, but also a considerable, negative impact on the social and economic dimensions. To achieve sustainable utilisation of marine fishery resources, China's fisheries management policies should be developed to enhance total output control and ecosystem reconstruction.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Even though environments impose some constraints on organizations, they still have a range of response. We find that newspapers, in Turkey, have three different identi-ties. One rooted in journalistic values. One rooted in running the newspaper as a business. And one rooted in maintaining its leadership role. These identities trigger three different transitive strategic responses. A transitive response is one in which an organization has an attack and a fall-back position. Further, we show how the link between an organization’s identity and its strategic response is moderated by the dominance of relations with institutional environment and the dominance of relations with technical environment. We tested these ideas in a pilot test with supportive interviews, and then in a large scale quantitative study.","Tech","University of Manchester"

First, 85 children aged 8 to 11 years old provided either a true or false report of a recent school event. At interview, some children were asked to gaze towards either the interviewer's face (IF) or a teddy bear's face (TF), whereas some children were given no gaze instruction. In both the IF and TF conditions, lie-tellers provided significantly fewer details than truth-tellers. A total of 192 adult evaluators then judged the credibility of 10 children's reports from one of the three ‘gaze’ conditions with and without guidance on level of detail. Evaluators discriminated truths from lies successfully when judging children instructed to look at IF, but not when children were asked to gaze towards TF. Evaluators who received guidance demonstrated better discrimination between true and false reports than evaluators who received no such information. ","Tech","University of Manchester"

A.; Manville, R.; Popa, O.; Cuello, L.; Goldstein, S.","30 Jun 2020","TOKs are outwardly rectifying K+ channels in fungi with two pore-loops and eight transmembrane spans. Here, we describe the TOKs from four pathogens that cause the majority of life-threatening fungal infections in humans. These TOKs pass large currents only in the outward direction like the canonical isolate from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScTOK), and distinct from other K+ channels. ScTOK, AfTOK1 (Aspergillus fumigatus) and H99TOK (Cryptococcus neoformans grubii) are K+-selective and pass current above the K+ reversal potential. CaTOK (Candida albicans) and CnTOK (Cryptococcus neoformans neoformans) pass both K+ and Na+ and conduct above a reversal potential reflecting the mixed permeability of their selectivity filter. Mutations in CaTOK and ScTOK at sites homologous to those that open the internal gates in classical K+ channels are shown to produce inward TOK currents. A favored model for outward rectification is proposed whereby the reversal potential determines ion occupancy, and thus conductivity, of the selectivity filter gate that is coupled to an imperfectly restrictive internal gate, permitting the filter to sample ion concentrations on both sides of the membrane.","Tech","University of Manchester"

By incorporating the effect of customers’ forward-looking behaviour, this paper offers a parsimonious and original model that captures the dynamics of MGPD in current high-technology markets. We empirically examine the feasibility of using previous MGPD models and our suggested model to explain the market growth of new products from high-technology industries. The results show that the new model exhibits better curve fitting and forecasting performance than the prior MGPD models in the cases of this study. For marketing researchers, our model and its results suggest customers’ forward looking behaviour is perhaps one of the key sales affecting factors that are missing in previous MGPD models in explaining nowadays’ cases. For marketing practitioners, this study offers a valuable tool for marketing strategies in high-tech industries.","Tech","University of Manchester"
"How SMEs can benefit from supply chain partnerships","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/how-smes-can-benefit-from-supply-chain-partnerships","Rezaei, J.; Ortt, R.; Trott, P.","1 Mar 2015","In recent literature on supply chain partnerships in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), there is controversy regarding the benefits of these partnerships. To resolve this controversy, specific information is needed on the implementation of these partnerships by SMEs; an area, that, thus far, has received little academic attention. In this paper, we examine different business functions (production, marketing and sales, purchasing and logistics, research and development (R&D) and finance) within a supply chain partnership. We collected data for each individual function from 279 high-tech SMEs and examined the relationship between the specific types of partnerships and the overall performance of the SMEs. The results indicate that it is only in the area of R&D that partnerships have a significant positive effect on overall firm performance. The results imply that SMEs primarily can benefit from particular types of supply chain partnerships, i.e. R&D partnerships. The results contribute to the debate in the literature by explaining why many SMEs were found not to benefit from these partnerships. We also provide implications for firms and how SMEs can better utilise supply chain management (SCM).","Tech","University of Manchester"

Most significantly, human resources (HR) data has never previously been examined with the lens of tech mining for science and technology analyses. This article is the first to examine job advertisement data considering research and development (R&D) progress and requirements, and hereafter, we refer to this as HR mining. The aim of this article is to use HR mining with the purpose of R&D and human capital intelligence using the job advertisement data of Turkey for the 2015–2017 period. The method of this study follows classification as part of the preprocessing step to determine R&D, engineering, and high-tech industry-related job advertisements. Afterward, we use clustering methods to identify areas where key human capital is required, and investments are made by R&D-oriented companies. The results show that it is possible to identify sector-oriented skill requirements and that the significance of the R&D skills varies. For the case of Turkey, we can clearly show the national human capital and R&D by identifying nine key clusters that indicate R&D progress and directions.","Tech","University of Manchester"
"Sustainable fishery policy for Thailand Gulf: a general equilibrium analysis","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/sustainable-fishery-policy-for-thailand-gulf-a-general-equilibriu","Pan, H. R.; Zhao, J.; Failler, P.; Wang, Y.","9 Sept 2019","Study of fisheries policy has conventionally been limited to partial equilibrium analysis where capture fisheries are considered in an isolated world without connection with the rest of the economy and without endogenous change in prices. This causes a two-way problem in policy analysis in that firstly consequences of fisheries policy cannot spread out of the sector and thus incorporate feedback from the rest of the economy, and secondly any economic policy also cannot affect the fisheries sector. As a result, any policy analysis regarding the fisheries sector cannot be accurate or even correct. This research builds a computable general equilibrium model for Thai fisheries to study full consequences of fisheries or economic policies in Thailand. The model specifies the economic activities of not only capture fisheries but also aquaculture, fish processing and fish marketing sectors as well as the rest of the economy, and captures their interactions. The empirical applications of the model with market-based policy instruments such as fishing taxes and subsidies reveal that fisheries or economic policies aiming to protect the resources or restructure the sector, if properly designed and combined, can achieve their goal as well as avoid potential losses.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Based on recent (2001–2015) comprehensive satellite‐based datasets (surface air temperature, land surface temperature, snow cover, daytime and nighttime cloud), this study finds that annual mean surface air temperature warming rates show rapid decrease above 4500 m despite increasing from 2000 to 4500 m. This indicates a reversal in EDW at the highest elevations on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is somehow different from the EDW derived from short‐term land surface temperature presented in an early study. The decrease of warming rate above 4500 m coincides with the elevation at which most of the current solid water resources reside. Thus, their decline may be less rapid than previously thought. Trends in nighttime cloud and snow cover are both correlated with patterns of EDW on the TP, but the leading factor varies on an annual and seasonal basis. Comparing datasets provides important evidence for understanding EDW and its controlling mechanisms in an extreme high‐elevation context.","Tech","University of Manchester"

In particular, an integrated ECOST model is composed of links between an ecological model constructed by Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software and a region Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). Then the costs and benefits of five fishing methods are compared from economic, ecological and social three dimensions base on the ECOST model. The potential effects of fishing effort reduction on fishing communication are explored by a series of dynamic simulations for a 10-year period. Key results from prediction (2005-2015) and policy simulations illustrate that fisheries of PRE are geared toward short-term economic profits at the expense of ecological gains and the whole group of societal benefits associated with fishing. However, the status quo can be improved to better levels by reducing fishing efforts. ","Tech","University of Manchester"

Many scholars have started focusing on this vital area from both a management and an engineering point of view. Previous studies have aimed to categorize this area using traditional review approaches, using a smaller body of literature and mostly focusing on the managerial aspects of remanufacturing. Our study is the only study for which tech-mining and scientometric methods are used to examine remanufacturing research, for the purpose of identifying top actors and key trends with regards to business and technological approaches. We combine both management and engineering related studies in this scientometric study. The results shed light on the principal actors, nations, organizations and scientific domains in this field. Remanufacturing research is categorized using the co occurrence based clustering method. This study identifies four broad research clusters: (1) Production planning and control of remanufacturing, (2) Material and remanufacturing engineering, (3) Supply chain management of remanufacturing process and, (4) Remanufacturing applications and new trends. This study offers benefits to numerous parties: policymakers in the remanufacturing field, academics who wish to see the research domains and those practitioners interested in the key management, processes, and technologies of remanufacturing activities.","Tech","University of Manchester"

We define the youth sport system as the set of interdependent persons and contexts that influence and are influenced by an athlete in youth sport. Our model builds directly from a systems perspective, and its tenets of holism, feedback loops, and roles. Specifically, we argue that the persons and contexts that surround an athlete in youth sport should be examined collectively, self-correct over time, and take on certain functions that are negotiated over time. The model extends past contributions toward integration by outlining how proximal and distal processes within youth sport can be studied in a more unified way. Looking forward, research designed to capture the nuanced ways persons and contexts influence and are influenced by one another in youth sport will be best positioned to impact theory and practice in meaningful ways.","Tech","University of Manchester"

D.; Bourgeois, Y.; Meheretu, Y.; Boissinot, S.","1 May 2022","Taxon-specific characteristics and extrinsic climatic and geological forces may both shape population differentiation and speciation. In geographically and taxonomically focused investigations, differentiation may occur synchronously as species respond to the same external conditions. Conversely, when evolution is investigated in taxa with largely varying traits, population differentiation and speciation is complex and shaped by interactions of Earth's template and species-specific traits. As such, it is important to characterize evolutionary histories broadly across the tree of life, especially in geographic regions that are exceptionally diverse and under pressures from human activities such as in biodiversity hotspots. Here, using whole-genome sequencing data, we characterize genomic variation in populations of six Ethiopian Highlands forest bird species separated by a lowland biogeographic barrier, the Great Rift Valley (GRV). In all six species, populations on either side of the GRV exhibited significant but varying levels of genetic differentiation. Species’ dispersal ability was negatively correlated with levels of population differentiation. Isolation with migration models indicated varied patterns of population differentiation and connectivity among populations of the focal species. We found that demographic histories—estimated for each individual—varied by both species and population but were consistent between individuals of the same species and sampling region. We found that genomic diversity varied by half an order of magnitude across species, and that this variation could largely be explained by the harmonic mean of effective population size over the past 200,000 years. Overall, we found that even in highly dispersive species like birds, the GRV acts as a substantial biogeographic barrier.","Tech","University of Manchester"

P.; Manthey, J. D.; Boissinot, S.","1 Jul 2019","Gaining a better understanding on how selection and neutral processes affect genomic diversity is essential to gain better insights into the mechanisms driving adaptation and speciation. However, the evolutionary processes affecting variation at a genomic scale have not been investigated in most vertebrate lineages. Here, we present the first population genomics survey using whole genome resequencing in the green anole (Anolis carolinensis). Anoles have been intensively studied to understand mechanisms underlying adaptation and speciation. The green anole in particular is an important model to study genome evolution. We quantified how demography, recombination, and selection have led to the current genetic diversity of the green anole by using whole-genome resequencing of five genetic clusters covering the entire species range. The differentiation of green anole's populations is consistent with a northward expansion from South Florida followed by genetic isolation and subsequent gene flow among adjacent genetic clusters. Dispersal out-of-Florida was accompanied by a drastic population bottleneck followed by a rapid population expansion. This event was accompanied by male-biased dispersal and/or selective sweeps on the X chromosome. We show that the interaction between linked selection and recombination is the main contributor to the genomic landscape of differentiation in the anole genome.","Tech","University of Manchester"
