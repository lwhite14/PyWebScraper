"The ‘best small nation navy in the world’? The twenty-first century Royal New Zealand Navy","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/the-best-small-nation-navy-in-the-world-the-twenty-first-century-","Paget, S.","1 Oct 2016","The Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) has set itself the admirable goal of being the ‘best small nation navy in the world’. As the RNZN’s fleet consists of just 11 vessels and New Zealand has one of the largest exclusive economic zones in the world, the achievement of that aim is extremely challenging. The RNZN is expected to conduct a wide range of tasks from combat to customs patrols and also needs to be interoperable with other regional players such as Australia and the US. The RNZN is a credible small navy and is generally effective in the roles that it undertakes, but given the projected increase in security challenges that the service is expected to face, it can be argued that the triangular factors of strategic objectives, defence capabilities and defence resources in New Zealand are currently out of synch. New Zealand is an inherently maritime nation and the RNZN is central to both its security and prosperity. It is essential that further investment is committed to the RNZN in order to enable it to fulfil all of the tasks expected of it and to ensure that it can achieve its aim to be the ‘best small nation navy’.","navy","University of Portsmouth"
"The Royal Navy: a history since 1900","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/the-royal-navy-a-history-since-1900","Redford, D.; Grove, P.","2014","Since 1900, the Royal Navy has seen vast changes to the way it operates. This book tells the story, not just of defeats and victories, but also of how the navy has adjusted to over 100 years of rapid technological and social change. The navy has changed almost beyond recognition since the far-reaching reforms made by Admiral Fisher at the turn of the century. Fisher radically overhauled the fleet, replacing the nineteenth-century wooden crafts with the latest in modern naval technology, including battleships (such as the iconic dreadnoughts), aircraft carriers and submarines. In World War I and World War II, the navy played a central role, especially as unrestricted submarine warfare and supply blockades became an integral part of twentieth-century combat. However it was the development of nuclear and missile technology during the Cold War era which drastically changed the face of naval warfare - today the navy can launch sea-based strikes across thousands of miles to reach targets deep inland. This book navigates the cross currents of over 100 years of British naval history.As well as operational issues, the authors also consider the symbolism attached to the navy in popular culture and the way naval personnel have been treated, looking at the changes in on-board life and service during the period, as well as the role of women in the navy. In addition to providing full coverage of the Royal Navy's wartime operations, the authors also consider the functions of the navy in periods of nominal peace - including disaster relief, diplomacy and exercises. Even in peacetime the Royal Navy had a substantial role to play. Covering the whole span of naval history from 1900 to the present, this book places the wars and battles fought by the navy within a wider context, looking at domestic politics, economic issues and international affairs. It will be essential reading for anyone interested in naval history and operations, as well as military history more generally.","navy","University of Portsmouth"
"Explaining early exit rates from the Royal Navy","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/explaining-early-exit-rates-from-the-royal-navy","Jaffry, S.; Ghulam, Y.; Apostolakis, A.","2013","The Royal Navy (RN) is striving to achieve the right manpower mix through improved retention levels. This paper analyses the ratings’ exit patterns from the RN using a hazard regression framework. We hypothesise that similar to civilian workers, job transition decisions of the RN ratings are dependent upon alternative job availability and macroeconomic conditions. In addition, working conditions, gender and skill mix, family commitments and promotion prospects in the Navy influence their decisions to leave early. We estimate the unemployment elasticity for males to be _0.65 (female _0.51), which is high, compared to the elasticity reported for the US Navy. The civilian wage is positively related to exit probability from the RN. Overall, married ratings are less likely to exit as compared to their unmarried counterparts, but married female ratings are 88% more likely to leave early as compared to unmarried females in the Navy. Promotion to higher ranks reduces the probability of early exists.","navy","University of Portsmouth"
"The “Hallmark of a first class Navy”: the nuclear-powered submarine in the Royal Navy 1960-77","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/the-hallmark-of-a-first-class-navy-the-nuclear-powered-submarine-","Redford, D.","2009","This article examines the introduction of nuclear-powered submarines into the Royal Navy and the images of national power that this generated, and indeed the images the Navy sought to present. It argues that from the Second World War onwards, the British slowly began to see the submarine not as a threat to their naval power and great power status, but as a means of shoring it up in the face of huge challenges to Britain's position in the world during the 1960s and 1970s. The article concludes that the imagery that surrounded the submarine indicates how important this type of vessel was to perceptions of the British naval power.","navy","University of Portsmouth"
"Explaining early exit patterns from the HM Royal Navy","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/explaining-early-exit-patterns-from-the-hm-royal-navy","Jaffry, S.; Ghulam, Y.; Apostolakis, A.","2005","Retention is a crucial issue, especially in the all volunteer HM Royal Navy. Naval manpower planners need to consider appropriate measures to improve retention in the service. The paper considers a number of factors that affect the likelihood of early exits from the navy. We classify these factors as external (macroeconomic, and labour market conditions) and internal (job specific) factors. The paper uses a Cox proportional hazard approach to measure individual naval ratings’ propensity to leave early from the navy.

The results show that gender is a significant factor affecting propensity to leave the navy. Females are more likely to leave when compared to their male counterparts irrespective of age. The results also indicate that married females are more likely to leave (around 1.1 times more likely to do so) when compared to their unmarried counterparts indicating that marital status transitions are very influential in explaining separations from the navy.

Overall the empirical results suggest that the navy should concentrate more on the needs and requirements of high-risk exit groups, with particular emphasis on 'work/life' balance. In addition, appropriate mechanisms need to be put in place in order to inform naval ratings of the relative financial benefits of staying within the navy as compared to civilian life. Naval manpower planners should also promote aggressively the non – pecuniary benefits (medical care, subsidised accommodation, job security etc.) offered by the navy to their personnel.","navy","University of Portsmouth"
"Heat strain in Royal Navy helicopter aircrew","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/heat-strain-in-royal-navy-helicopter-aircrew","House, J. R.","1999","A review of the literature on heat strain and aircrew and a questionnaire survey of Royal Navy aircrew have been completed. Aircrew appreciate, some 50% from first hand experience, that heat strain can reduce their operational endurance and performance. They are at greatest risk of developing it in the pre-flight period, especially when wearing Nuclear, Biological, or Chemical (NBC) protective equipment. Several techniques they use to reduce this risk are described. Some may be of particular assistance in the field should air conditioned facilities be unavailable. However, opportunities to improve the thermal environment within the aircraft on the ground and in flight are limited as the heat generated within it and high levels of solar radiation impinging on it severely challenge air conditioning units, themselves constrained by weight and size. Other demands placed on protective clothing offer little potential to increase the rate at which aircrew can lose accumulated heat. It is concluded that an appropriate micro-climate cooling system worn next to the skin may be required to achieve truly significant reductions in heat strain. Research at the Institute of Naval Medicine has identified liquid cooling techniques which may be suitable for aircrew in all but the smallest helicopters. Any views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of the Department.","navy","University of Portsmouth"
"Job transitions in the British Royal Navy","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/job-transitions-in-the-british-royal-navy","Jaffry, S.; Ghulam, Y.; Apostolakis, A.","2009","Retention is a crucial issue in the Armed Forces, especially in the all-volunteer Royal Navy. This is mainly due to a number of organisational challenges and changes in operational requirements and priorities. Naval manpower planners need to consider appropriate measures to improve retention in the service. The evidence gathered from the empirical investigation shows that external (pull) factors exert a significant effect on the early exit/quit rates from the Royal Navy. Key economic factors such as pay and employment opportunities in the civilian employment markets play an important role in the decisions that individual ratings make with regard to remaining in naval employment or leaving altogether. In particular, it was found that quit rates from the Navy are negatively associated with the claimant count (unemployment) rate (i.e. as the unemployment rate in the civilian economy increases, the early exit rate from the Navy decreases), whilst the overall increase in civilian wages bears a positive relationship on quitting behaviour. The analysis provides further evidence to support the need for policies that are tailor-made to cater for different ratings' specialisations within the Royal Navy.","navy","University of Portsmouth"
"A history of the Royal Navy: World War 2","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/a-history-of-the-royal-navy-world-war-2","Redford, D.","2014","The Royal Navy's operations in World War II started on 3 September 1939 and continued until the surrender of Japan in August 1945 - there was no 'phoney war' at sea. The navy played a central role in the evacuation of the retreating British army at Dunkirk, and later orchestrated the sinking of Germany's mighty battleship and Hitler's pride, the Bismarck. Without the Royal Navy's attention to the defence of Britain's seaborne trade - especially in the struggle against German U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic - there would not have been food for the country, fuel for the RAF's operations or supplies to keep the army fighting in Europe, North Africa and the Far East. Yet the outstanding naval contribution to Britain's survival and eventual victory came at a heavy cost in terms of ships and to the men who had to face not just the violence of the enemy, but also the violence of the sea. This book argues that World War II was, effectively, a maritime war; it was the Royal Navy's war.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

However, the provision of NGS during the 2003 Iraq War indicated that the capability remained useful in the modern era. Furthermore, lessons learned during past RAN operations and those of the Royal Navy and United States Navy demonstrate the enduring relevance of NGS. Australia’s development of an amphibious capability will ensure that NGS remains useful in the future for a number of important reasons, including utility, cost-effectiveness and interoperability.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

Allied with difficulties of matching personnel numbers and posts, significant skill mismatches can take a long time to eradicate, with obvious financial and operational penalties. In the light of these factors, a holistic understanding of the exit behaviour of naval personnel is vital for naval manpower planners. This paper analyses ratings’ voluntary (quits) and involuntary (separation) exit patterns from the Royal Navy using an independent competing risks hazard regression analysis framework. The results show that both voluntary and involuntary exits are pro cyclical with respect to macroeconomic and labour market conditions for both male and female ratings. Male ratings are more likely to quit or separate due to a lack of promotion to higher ranks as compared with females. Male ratings are also more likely to quit as a result of a hectic operational tempo when compared with their female counterparts. Frequency of sea/shore deployments also seems to exert a significant effect with respect to quits and separation outcomes of both genders. In terms of marital status married males are less likely to quit compared with their unmarried male counterparts, whereas the opposite is the case for female ratings","navy","University of Portsmouth"

This was a period in which the Royal Navy grew to become one of the largest enterprises in Europe with operations throughout the world. The governance, control and accountability practices imposed upon pursers are analysed. The Regulations for accounting records to be kept by pursers indicate that accounting changed very little in the analysis period, until 1808, when it became substantially more detailed. Drawing on institutional theory, it is argued that this was due to external pressures for increased governance following the impeachment of Melville (First Lord of the Admiralty), public spending administrative and accounting reforms and political disapproval of ‘offices of profit’. The article provides important insights to the development of accounting, governance, audit and accountability within the Royal Navy, and enhances understanding of the historically unique role of pursers.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

The contrast between the deployments of the American-designed and built Charles F. Adams class guided missile destroyers and the British-designed Daring class destroyer, HMAS Vendetta, represented the fruition of a small navy being pulled in two different directions. The RAN was undergoing a transitional period, which saw the service increasingly align with the United States Navy. This was a monumental shift in policy, as the Royal Navy had provided a model for the RAN to emulate since its creation in 1911. The Vietnam War offered a clear test of standardization and demonstrated that common ship designs provided a platform for interoperability, but did not guarantee it. The Australian ships were able to make a worthwhile contribution to a predominantly American naval effort, but they faced a number of challenges in achieving interoperability. The basis for successful co-operation was provided by the existence of common procedures and standardized equipment, but was necessarily supplemented by ad hoc measures and impromptu workarounds.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

Low fitness levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of injury and training attrition. To increase pass rates for Royal Navy (RN) Phase I training, a pre-joining fitness test (PJFT) was introduced (2.4 km treadmill best effort run). The PJFT was designed to identify candidates with poor levels of aerobic fitness who may be prone to leave training prematurely.
Aim: To examine the impact of the PJFT on training length and outcomes. Methods: Time taken to run 2.4 km and training outcomes were measured before and after the introduction of the PJFT. Information was collected from RN Phase I training establishments and the network of careers offices between 2002 and 2005. Recruits were placed into quartile groups based on 2.4 km overground running performance. The no PJFT and PJFT groups and the 2.4-km run performance quartiles were compared for training outcomes and time spent in training. Results: Training measures were available for 4818 recruits who entered training before the PJFT's introduction (no PJFT) and 3305 after its introduction (PJFT). The pass rate increased from 78 to 88% following the introduction of the PJFT (P < 0.01). The number of recruits applying for voluntary release decreased from 15% (no PJFT group) to 6% (PJFT group) (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: The PJFT positively impacted on RN Phase 1 training pass rates. A greater number of recruits successfully completed training, fewer applied for voluntary release and the number and length of training extensions were reduced.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

In particular, it considers how steam propulsion made vessels utterly dependent on a particular resource – coal – and its distribution around the world. In doing so, it shows that the ‘coal question’ was central to imperial defence and the protection of trade, requiring the creation of infrastructures that spanned the globe. This infrastructure required careful management, and the processes involved show the development of bureaucracy and the reliance on the ‘contractor state’ to ensure this was both robust and able to allow swift mobilisation in war. The requirement to stop regularly at foreign stations also brought men of the Royal navy into contact with local coal heavers, as well as indigenous populations and landscapes. These encounters and their dissemination are crucial to our understanding of imperial relationships and imaginations at the height of the imperial age. ","navy","University of Portsmouth"

This report reviews the potential solutions to this problem and concludes that only a method of actively cooling personnel will reduce heat strain and increase the number of people that can be processed through ships' NBC CS. Amongst the wide range of cooling equipment that might offer a benefit, only hand immersion in cold water and ice-vests are practically useful for use in NBC CS. To assess how effective these techniques are likely to be INM has modelled the thermal effects under environmental conditions expected in the CS when operating in a hot climate. The model predicted that hand immersion in cold water (10 degrees C) would be the most effective cooling method, providing that personnel were able to take regular rest periods to immerse the hands. If it is preferred that personnel in the CS be able to work continuously, then ice-vests would be effective. The safe total work time that can be achieved in a three hour period without a cooling intervention is approximately 72 minutes, regular rest periods must be taken throughout the three hour work period, to total of 108 minutes. Safe work times can be increased to 99 minutes by using an ice-vest and 117 minutes by using hand immersion in 10 degrees C water, with required rest times reduced accordingly, thereby increasing capacity of CS teams to decontaminate personnel.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

When the hands were immersed (HI) in 10 degrees C water during the five minute rest periods heat strain was significantly lower (P < 0.01) and work endurance times were increased. One subject was withdrawn early on reaching cardiac safety limits, two on reaching Tre limits (39 degrees C) at 105 minutes, and six subjects completed the 180 minute exposure with a final Tre of 38.4 degrees C (0.3 degree C). Using 'iced' (0 degree C) rather than 10 degrees C water for HI further reduced heat strain (P < 0.01) and increased endurance times. Three subjects were withdrawn early on reaching cardiac safety limits, the remaining six completing the 180 minute exposure, with a final Tre of 38.3 degrees C (0.5 degree C). Using an ice-vest (IV) in conjunction with HI further reduced heat strain (P < 0.01) and increased endurance times. Two subjects were withdrawn early on reaching cardiac safety limits, the remaining seven completing the 180 minute exposure, with a final Tre of 38.2 degrees C (0.8 degree C) when 10 degrees C HI water was used, and Tre 38.0 degrees C (0.4 degree C) when 0 degree C HI water was used. There were no reports of finger numbness or loss of dexterity due to HI, and all personnel were able to remove their own individual Protective Equipment (IPE) without difficulty. It is expected that using HI will not reduce the ability to decontaminate or undress others. The HI technique and IV equipment should be introduced into the Fleet. 'Iced' water should be used in preference to 10 degrees C, although any water colder than 25 degrees C will provide some benefit. The IVs increased torso girth and personnel should try them on (with frozen ice packs inserted) prior to their use and ensure that their protective clothing still fits, or obtain a larger size.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

After 15-20 days of use during live-fire training (and regular washing) the new type hood appeared to be suffering from excessive wear and there was concern that the level of protection might have decreased. To examine this, 25 new and 25 used hoods (worn and washed approximately 15-20 times) were exposed to flame, five each at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10?s using a flame manikin head to ascertain the predicted burn injuries. The new hood was shown to provide excellent protection against the most severe flame engulfment to which RN personnel might accidentally be exposed. There was no evidence that the protection afforded by the hoods was reduced by prolonged use and washing and therefore it was safe for the “new-type” hood to remain in-service.","navy","University of Portsmouth"
"Loaning ships and leveraging influence? American and British responses to the HMAS Voyager tragedy ","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/loaning-ships-and-leveraging-influence-american-and-british-respo","Paget, S.","1 Feb 2021","The loss of HMAS Voyager following a collision with HMAS Melbourne on 10 February 1964 was a national tragedy for Australia. Britain and the United States were quick to express their sympathy and both offered to loan a ship to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) to offset their loss. The offers were genuine and were intended to aid an important partner. The RAN had been tied closely to the RN since its creation, but the 1950s and 1960s witnessed an important transition and the RAN’s decision to purchase the American designed and built Charles F. Adams class destroyer as its new class of escorts in 1961 exemplified an increasing alignment with the United States Navy (USN). The Voyager tragedy reignited the debate over standardization and afforded both the Royal Navy (RN) and USN with an opportunity to attempt to strengthen ties with the RAN. The eventual Australian decision to accept the British offer, ultimately, had little effect on the development of the RAN. Rather than harking back to a time when the RAN was an appendage of the RN, the decision to select the British ship was a mark of its increasing independence.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

Ann Coats provides a reassessment of theefficiency and effectiveness of English dockyards in building, fitting out andrepairing Royal Navy warships. Effectiveness, which encompasses performance, productivity and use of resources, is a more appropriate yardstick than efficiency to assess the Admiralty and Navy Boards and the dockyards. An assessment of both the efficiency and effectiveness of naval dockyards is essential to a study of their history, and has been made contextually by many historians of naval administration. Surveying naval dockyards from the reign of Henry VII (1485–1509) to the twentieth century, Haas began with the premise that 'the Royal Dockyards were not well-managed. Sidney Pollard praised Haas's 'intelligent insight' directed at the 'mass of surviving official papers' which enabled him to make 'judgements on the performance of the dockyards by the usual management criteria'.","navy","University of Portsmouth"
"Fuelling mobility: coal and Britain’s naval power, c. 1870–1914","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/fuelling-mobility-coal-and-britains-naval-power-c-18701914","Gray, S.","9 Jul 2017","This article considers the introduction of steam powered warships to the Royal Navy to show how oceanic mobility in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was contingent on the global availability, and consequently mobility, of coal. Whilst the introduction of steam technology may have freed warships from the vagaries of wind and tides, the navy was now chained not just to coaling stations, but also to the wider infrastructure which guaranteed coal’s movement to these stations around the globe. Thus, the ability to control both the source of the fuel and its movement was crucial to the mobility of British naval vessels tasked with protecting British interests worldwide, and was, therefore, central to British global power. This article explores how the navy ensured the availability of high quality steam-coal at British overseas stations, analysing the processes involved in sourcing high quality coal for naval ships and its transportation overseas. It also shows how the admiralty sought to make such arrangements more professional, and to guarantee the highest quality of coal at every station. It explores how these changes ensured that the infrastructure remained remarkably robust, despite its complex nature. It then assesses how Britain’s rivals failed to achieve the same control over fuelling in the age of the coal ship, offering Britain a huge advantage in the wider world. Finally, the paper considers the ramifications of Britain losing this advantage when it switched to oil. Overall, it argues that, although generally ignored, fuel, and particularly the ability to control its global movement, is crucial to understanding naval mobility. This, of course, is true not just in terms of the navy, but also applicable to other significant geopolitical contexts and processes.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

Multinational naval interoperability during Operation Iraqi Freedom","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/mind-over-matter-multinational-naval-interoperability-during-oper","Paget, S.","19 Jan 2020","The increasing frequency of multinational operations has heightened the importance of interoperability. While human and cultural factors are only two pieces of the interoperability jigsaw they are of enduring significance. The cohesiveness of the relationship amongst the Royal Australian Navy, the Royal Navy and the United States Navy during the 2003 Iraq War was underpinned by high levels of perceptive interoperability, which manifested itself in effective working relationships. That conflict demonstrated that while historical ties provided a foundation for cooperation, a number of multinational initiatives were undertaken to further enhance interoperability. This article addresses how such a high level of perceptive interoperability was achieved by examining the conduct of multinational exercises, the importance of personnel exchanges and the role of liaison officers, before considering the effect it had on the conduct of operations. The Iraq War demonstrated that cultural factors are at least as important as other facets of interoperability.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

This exciting new book explores the changing attitudes to the submarine in Britain from World War One to the age of nuclear combat. Including discussion of unrestricted submarine warfare, the experience of the world wars, nuclear power and weapons, as well as films and novels based on submarine warfare, this book is essential for naval historians, students and those interested in aspects of submarine development and use.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

dependent on coal. Getting this coal aboard warships was dirty, exhausting, and dangerous
work. Even in 1914, it was still largely done by hand and, increasingly, it was the job of the
ships’ crews to perform this task. Thus coaling was a regular task for sailors, usually occurring
every 7–10 days, and one that could last all day. This article examines the different methods of
coaling warships, particularly focusing on the use of sailor labour and colliers to reflect their
increasing use as the period progressed. In addition to examining the roles of each of the ships’
crew in coaling, it also assesses sailors’ attitudes towards the task. In doing so, it shows that such
a hated job required coping mechanisms, such as fancy dress, music, and competition, as well as
the promise of alcohol and shore leave afterwards. Finally, the article examines the dangers of
coaling, showing that a regular need for fuel frequently exposed sailors to serious danger, often
suffering broken bones and, all too frequently, death.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

M.","1 Feb 2020","The Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1905 was a watershed moment for the presence of the Royal Navy in the Pacific. Although it allowed the Royal Navy to concentrate its fleets in European waters, this strategy caused resentment due to the underlying fear of the ‘Yellow Peril’, especially in the British dominions of Australia and New Zealand. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance presented some challenges to the received Edwardian racial hierarchy and the idea of British military supremacy. This article demonstrates how the ‘port town’ not only became a place of mediation where high-level international diplomacy mingled with the face-to-face experience of an alliance ‘in practice’, but also a space through which issues such as Otherness and imperial security were contested and explored.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

Lacking indigenous sources of sufficiently high quality, Argentina and Brazil in particular came to rely heavily on Welsh coal for their energy needs. While playing a crucial role in the economic development of such countries, Welsh coal and its distribution network of coaling stations also helped in protecting the trade between Britain and South America, allowing the Royal Navy to have access to the most suitable coal for its purposes at distances varying from almost 4,000 to 10,000 miles from its point of origin. This paper explores various aspects of the development of this trade and argues that, in discussions of the development of the informal empire, the significance of (Welsh) coal should not be overlooked, as has tended to be the case in some modern works.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

As such, coalition naval operations increasingly became the norm throughout the twentieth-century, and there is little sign of this abating in the twenty-first. Multinational operations provide a number of benefits, but they also present a number of challenges. Examining the dynamics of coalition operations involving the Royal Navy (RN), Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and the United States Navy (USN) during the Korean War, Vietnam War and the Iraq War, this book provides a broad overview of naval interoperability between the three navies. Using the naval gunfire support (NGS) capability as a lens through which to analyse operations, the study explores a diverse range of issues, including: command and control, communications, equipment standardisation, intelligence, logistics, planning, rules of engagement, tactics, techniques and procedures and training. Approaching the subject through both historical and contemporary perspectives not only provides a unique assessment of the variation in the effectiveness of interoperability over time, but also offers a platform for better understanding and enhancing the performance of future coalition naval operations. Based on extensive archival research in Australia, the UK and the US, as well as wide-ranging interviews, this book sheds new light on the dynamics of conducting coalition operations.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

(ed.)","2012","This is the first of three volumes detailing the history of the Fleet Air Arm, the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers and naval air squadrons, during the Second World War. It deals with the formative period between 1939 and 1941 when the Fleet Air Arm tried to recover from the impact of dual control and economic stringencies during the inter-war period while conducting a wide range of operations. There is in depth coverage of significant operations including the Norwegian campaign, Mediterrranean actions such as the attack on the Italian Fleet at Taranto and the Battle of Cape Matapan, and the torpedo attacks on the German battleship Bismarck. Incidents involving the loss of and damage to aircraft carriers, including the sinking of Ark Royal, one of the most famous ships in the early years of World War Two, are also reported. Of major importance are key planning and policy issues. These include the requirements for aircraft carriers, the evolving debate regarding the necessary types of aircraft and attempts to provide sufficient facilities ashore for naval air squadrons. A wide range of official documents are used to enable the reader to appreciate the complexity of the operations and other issues which faced the Fleet Air Arm. This volume will appeal to everyone interested in how the Royal Navy adapted to the use of air power in the Second World War. Its reports bring actions vividly to life. Its correspondence demonstrates the fundamental foundation of planning, policy and logistics. In common with succeeding volumes on the Fleet Air Arm, this volume provides a new and vital perspective on how Britain fought the Second World War.","navy","University of Portsmouth"

V.","24 Aug 2018","Portsmouth Harbour and St Helen’s and Spithead anchorages were vital to Britain’s navy for 2,000 years. From C3–5 AD, Portchester Castle, at the head of the harbour, operated as a Roman cross-Channel hub and provided national facilities for Classis Britannica. From c.1200, they were augmented by the Plantagenet galley dock on Portsea Island, and in 1495 superseded by the first permanent drydock. The Isle of Wight, invaded by the Danes in 998 and the French in 1340 and 1545, would became an essential naval defence: a militarised barrier and buffer. Henry VIII built St Helen’s bulwark on the island in 1539–45 to protect its anchorage and victualling facilities. In 1719, St Helen’s abandoned C13 church tower became the first seamark for Portsmouth’s eastern approach and the station to await a favourable wind. By the end of the C16, when Britain was trading and waging war beyond the continental shelf, the navy could access the Atlantic faster from the south coast than from the Rivers Thames and Medway. Despite advantageous C16/17 reports regarding operations and expeditions, Portsmouth had to combat metropolitan preferences and prejudices. By the mid-C17, however, the navy acknowledged Portsmouth’s superb natural assets and rebuilt its drydock in 1658. Thenceforth, the navy prioritised Portsmouth in technological innovations. The harbour, sheltered strategically and climatically by the Isle of Wight, could accommodate the fleet. Spithead anchorage, unsurpassed for assembly and supply, was the scene of spectacular fleet reviews, even during the 1797 Spithead Mutiny. Focusing on the late-C16 to early-C19, this chapter will explain how Portsmouth, Spithead and Saint Helen’s endured as a fortified seascape to support war.","navy","University of Portsmouth"
