"Towards a theory of small-firm low-tech food innovation","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/towards-a-theory-of-small-firm-low-tech-food-innovation","Vyas, V.; Vyas, R.","14 Aug 2014","Innovation in low-tech sectors such as food & drinks continues to be under-researched and under-theorised despite growing evidence on low and medium technology sectors’ substantial contribution to economic growth in the developed countries. This attempt to build theory from case study research, contributes to an embryonic literature in this area through a set of propositions grounded in process theory and organisational innovativeness literature. We postulate that small firm food innovation is shaped exogenously by the cultural context of food consumption and internally by high-variety-low-volume manufacturing environment of the innovative firm. The ensuing incremental innovation is underpinned by a counterintuitive avoidance of development of health foods. These innovative efforts are abetted by the large retailers who, in turn, use these agile enterprises’ creativity and plasticity to achieve their own competitive goals. The propositions outlined here complement the extant theory through a sharper contextual focus in contrast to the previous research.","Tech","University of Manchester"

"Industry-academia linkages in a high tech research field","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/industry-academia-linkages-in-a-high-tech-research-field","Ozcan, S.; Islam, N.","24 Sept 2015","Currently academic researches' focus started changing towards protecting IP rights and to transferring them into industrial actors. Accordingly, it is argued that academic's basic research focus started shifting towards applied research as it is essential for the radical inventions to be introduced in a competitive market. This research seeks to understand industry-academia linkages in a high tech field such as nano-crystals. In regards to supporting the technology transfer process within or cross country, this study illustrates the technology development trends and actors' engagement; nano-crystals technology and their interconnections; and maps the organisational (industry-academia) linkages that enhance the commercialisation of radical inventions. The results show that the industry-academia linkages that appeared as decentralized structure are more stable compared to other linkage types. Korean and Japanese organisations present such stable linkages. The linkages are even stronger when they appear as a mono-linkage type. Chinese organisations show a great illustration of such an effective mono-linkage of co-inventorships in high tech research field. The organisations in the US maintain international linkages.","Tech","University of Manchester"

"Ariadne: public landmarks sited in the Korea Tech University campus","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/ariadne-public-landmarks-sited-in-the-korea-tech-university-campu","Pedrabissi, D.","31 Jan 2015","Nine public landmarks were built on a university campus in South Korea. As a giant Ariadne’s thread, these bent metal structures help to better orientate the users around the campus. At the same time, the project aims to link the existing network of faculties, emphasising their interdisciplinary nature and thus creating a unique system. The landmarks evoke a thread that, with simple structures, emerge from the ground and stitch together the most important places on the university campus. Only the central landmark is more complex and iconic, since it represents the beginning and the end point of the thread, and it is placed in the central university quad.The design was carried out in collaboration with Korea Tech and a group of students in order to develop the idea and to further implement the detailed design. The process was thus an experiment of practical and educational design, with concepts that bridge art, architecture, and urbanism. The structures have enhanced the quality of the public space and helped to create a sense of appropriation from the users.","Tech","University of Manchester"

The focus of such studies remains high-technology enterprises, which continue to attract both academic and popular interest, oblivious to the innovative endeavours of people in traditional low-tech industries. This book attempts to address this imbalance through a comprehensive analysis of innovation in this largely neglected area. Based on case studies of seven small innovative food companies, this book presents an in-depth analysis of innovation in the Scottish food and drinks industry and unravels a lesser-known approach to effective low-cost product innovation, which is simple and economical, yet elegant and successful. Using careful data collection and rigorous statistical testing, the analysis and findings in this book address a wide spectrum of interests: academics in business schools, policy makers in governments and executives and entrepreneurs in food and other low-technology sectors.

"Survival and growth of high-tech SMEs: some uncommon strategies","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/survival-and-growth-of-high-tech-smes-some-uncommon-strategies","Vyas, V.","2009","Innovation, by its very nature, disrupts the equilibrium of a competitive market and causes uncertainty. To confront it, the enterprise must innovate further. This competition driven innovation (Cantner et al., 2004), which is central to technical progress and responsible for keeping large corporations vibrant, however, creates peculiar difficulties for the new firm. As R&D budgets burgeon and technical change accelerates, innovation becomes even more focused and competitive. Markets take unanticipated paths hammered by the onslaught of innovators. New products spring up and disappear before people have a chance to look at them and the inventors have time to exploit the gains of their creation. The scale of creative destruction wrought by entrepreneurs trying to break into rival markets using innovative edge of their products and processes has been, of late, growing increasingly discomforting. No wonder, the closure rates are mounting and the steady advancements in knowledge continue to leave behind entrepreneurial mass graves. It seems, the new enterprise in the next century is going to awaken to a competitive reality that is both overwhelming and scary. Entrepreneurs everywhere are now facing the classic Schumpeterian competition, the one that strikes not at the margin of profits and output, but at their very lives. Though the technical innovations of the past decades have opened up a whole gamut of opportunities for start-ups, they have also, sharpened the edge of competition and have increased its ability to mop down the relatively inefficient. As efficiency standards rise, survival becomes increasingly difficult for new enterprises. Effective management and exploitation of change of this magnitude and complexity is extremely difficult. Under such intense uncertainty, there seems to be no guarantee of payoffs from any programme to improve technology (Metcalfe, 1997).","Tech","University of Manchester"
"Promoting road safety","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/promoting-road-safety","Esbester, M. O.","Apr 2015","This article is among the first historical considerations of road safety in Africa. It argues that race and class, as colonial dualisms, analytically frame two defining moments in the development of African automobility and its infrastructure—“Africanization” in the first decade of Kenya’s political independence from Britain, 1963–75, and democratization in postapartheid South Africa. We argue that recent road safety interventions in both countries exemplify an “epidemiological turn” influenced by public health constructions of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. African states’ framing of road safety in behaviorist terms has obscured larger debates around redressing the historical legacies of racialized access to roads and the technopolitics of African automobility. Civic involvement in road safety initiatives has tended to be limited, although the specter of road carnage has entered into the public imagination, largely through the death of high profile Africans. However, some African road users continue to pursue alternative, and often culturally embedded, strategies to mitigate the dangers posed by life “on the road.”","Tech","University of Manchester"

But within this phenomenological umbrella, attention is now being focussed upon the policing of 'hi-tech crime'. This policy intervention again underlines the importance of an understanding of the new international policy networks, their transnational dynamics of governance, and the democratic opportunities for intervention in the policy process. The paper will first outline the development of the policy networks on organised crime within the European Union and G8. Second, by focussing upon the development of policies on hi-tech crime within three international fora, the paper will underline the apparent importance of 'infrastructural power' in ensuring that the policing of hi-tech crime is translated to the law enforcement agenda.","Tech","University of Manchester"

It investigates a) the motives behind SMEs’ coopetition b) coopetitive benefits for SMEs and for the market c) the coopetition success’ barriers. Using qualitative methods, we find that i) coopetitive SMEs pursue rent-gaining strategies with reduced financial risk, and are able to improve the market ii) motives relate to financial risk reduction and performance improvement iii) coopetitive SMEs accessed resources, improved quality, enabled economies of scale and knowledge diffusion in the industry iv) lack of trust or overtrusting can limit coopetition’s success v) geographical proximity is important practically or for strategic positioning. The majority of coopetition research focused on large enterprises in technological-intensive industries. We contribute to the understanding of the transferability of coopetition theory outside its traditional context, by bringing evidence of coopetition strategies between SMEs belonging to an alternative, fast growing and highly coopetitive industry.

"Supply chain drivers, partnerships and performance of high-tech SMEs: An empirical study using SEM","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/supply-chain-drivers-partnerships-and-performance-of-high-tech-sm","Rezaei, J.; Trott, P.; Ortt, R.","23 Mar 2018","Purpose – In this study, high-tech small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SME) supply chain partnerships are examined. Partnerships are considered at the level of business function rather than the entire organisation. Secondly, the drivers of SMEs to engage in partnerships are assessed to see whether functions engage in partnerships for different reasons. Thirdly, performance per function is assessed to see the differential effect of partnerships on the function’s performance. 

Design/methodology/approach – In this study, the relationship between the drivers of SMEs to engage in partnerships, four types of partnerships (marketing and sales, R&D, purchasing and logistics, and production) and four types of functional performances of firms (marketing and sales, R&D, purchasing and logistics, and production) are examined. The data has been collected from 279 SMEs. The proposed hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). 

Findings – The results indicate that there are considerable differences between business functions in terms of the degree of involvement in partnerships and the effect of partnerships on the performance of these functions. This paper contributes to research by explaining the contradictory results of partnerships on SMEs performance.

 Practical implications – This study helps firms understand (i) which type of partnership should be stablished based on the firm’s drivers to engage in supply chain partnership; and (ii) which partnership has a significant effect of which type of business performance of the firm.

 Originality/value – The originality of this study is to investigate the relationship between different drivers to engage in supply chain partnership and different types of partnerships and different functional performance of firm in a single model. ","Tech","University of Manchester"

M.","Apr 2015","This special issue of Technology and Culture explores the ways in which road use and road safety have changed since the 1880s, including how different road users interacted with each other, technology, regulation, engineering, design, and the built environment. Together the articles provide a look at a variety of approaches across North America, Europe, and Africa and at different road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers. While most of the papers individually consider a single national example, the picture that is built up across the issue allows comparisons between countries to demonstrate how road safety and automobility technologies are historically and culturally contingent. The issue concludes with a commentary from a prominent policymaker in the hope that better understanding of how accidents, safety, and risks are co-constructed and co-produced can offer insights into how we might reduce deaths and injuries in the future.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Further, it analyses two case studies related to aspects of security and safety: the Virginia Tech Shooting in 2007 and the Lion Air 610 crash in 2018. Both case studies address the concept of learning from failures. In doing so, an analysis of the root causes and vulnerabilities through the methods of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) is conducted to identify lessons to be learned. Results: Findings are intended to stimulate organisational learning and improve organisational processes to mitigate disasters from happening again. Conclusion: The value of this study is that aspects of learning and unlearning from failures have been identified for the cases used. Expectation for future studies is to extend the proposed methodology to other cases in the fields of surveillance, security and safety. ","Tech","University of Manchester"

P.; Chen, J.; Jin, Q.; Liu, W.","3 Dec 2020","This paper presents experimental and analytical studies on flexural behavior of slab-rib integrated Sandwich composite decks. The influences of layers of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) facesheets, foam densities, and the existence of webs and cross beams are discussed herein. The test results showed that the existence of vertical webs remarkably improved the debonding of the facesheets from the foam core, thus increasing the ultimate load by 59% compared with the specimens without webs. However, the existence of horizontal webs has insignificant effect on the failure mode and ultimate load. Increasing the number of layers of GFRP facesheets from 2 to 4 and 6 results in 100% and 214% increments in ultimate loads, respectively, while the specimen with lower density of foam had a higher ultimate load than the specimen with higher density of foam due to deformation compatibility between GFRP skins and foam core with low density. The analysis software Abaqus Explicit was used to simulate the flexural behavior of test specimens, and the numerical results agreed well with the test data. The verified finite element model was extended to analyze the influences of the number of GFRP layers on the top of decks and the height of vertical webs. Based on equivalent method and compatibility of shear deformation, the flexural and shear rigidities were estimated. Then, analytical solution for displacement of the slab-rib integrated Sandwich composite decks subjected to four-point load was derived out. Comparison of analytical and experimental results shows that the displacements can be precisely predicted by the present theoretical model.","Tech","University of Manchester"
"Innovation and new product development in SMEs: an investigation of Scottish food industry","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/innovation-and-new-product-development-in-smes-an-investigation-o","Vyas, V.; Masson, R.; Laing, S.; Craig, A.","2007","Innovation is one of the most reported determinants of business success. Much of research on business innovation, however, is focussed on high-tech sectors and innovation studies of low-tech businesses are rare. This paper reporting a doctoral research on innovation in Scottish food industry attempts to address this lacuna. Another impetus for this study stems from the fact that though Scotland has historically been at the vanguard of scientific, industrial and business innovations, it has legged behind recently and has consequently become one of the less competitive regions within Europe. This study of innovation in one of Scotland’s major industries is thus both interesting and relevant. This paper reports results of semi-structured personal interviews and personality tests of innovativeness of key decision makers in 8 Scottish food companies known for innovation. The results show that the personality of people responsible for new product development plays a significant role in giving a business its innovative proclivity. Innovative food companies in Scotland follow an analogous process of idea generation, validation, implementation and full product deployment with some minor, though, significant departures. Innovators in Scottish food industry consider packaging innovation an inseparable part of product innovation. They, however, largely shun creation of healthier versions of foods, as an innovation option.  A major finding of this study -supermarkets as the main drivers of innovation in Scottish food industry- is a revelation and raises need to revisit their role in regeneration of regional economies.

A tech-mining method was applied and the subsequent analysis was performed using Thomson data analyser software. The findings show that nations such as Korea and Japan are highly collaborative in sharing technological knowledge across academic and corporate organisations within their national boundaries, and China presents, in some cases, a great illustration of effective patent collaboration and co-inventorship.

"Axial compressive behavior and energy absorption of syntactic foam-filled GFRP tubes with lattice frame reinforcement","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/axial-compressive-behavior-and-energy-absorption-of-syntactic-foa","Jin, Q.; Wang, J.; Chen, J.; Bao, F.","1 Nov 2022","A kind of innovative foam-filled glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) tube with lattice frame reinforcement was proposed for improving energy absorption capacity. The crushing experimental results revealed that lattice frame reinforcement contributed to increasing compressive strength and energy absorption, by ∼33 and 90%, respectively, for syntactic foam-filled GFRP tubes and their plateau stress almost increased to peak strength. Decreasing distances between transverse or vertical bars resulted in increasing energy absorption in composite columns with GFRP shells. The effects of lattice frames on the mechanical behaviors of composite columns without GFRP shells was less significant compared to columns with shells. Under the same content in foam cores, the energy absorption ability of syntactic foam-filled GFRP tubes with lattice frame reinforcement was much higher than that of specimens reinforced by MWCNTs. In addition, an analytical model considering the local buckling of lattice frames was proposed to predict the ultimate crushing load of composite columns with reinforcement. The analytical solutions agreed well with experimental results. This study provided a promising approach for designing a lightweight composite column with a high capacity for energy absorption, which could be used as an energy absorption member in engineering structures.","Tech","University of Manchester"

The impact test results showed that the penetration depth of GFRP panels with synthetic foam is much smaller than that of bare synthetic foam panels. The edgewise compression test results indicated the facesheet debonding dominates the failure mode of the sandwich panels without lattice webs, while the failure mode of the sandwich panels with lattice webs is predominated by the wrinkling and delamination of the facesheets and the crushing of foam core. The influences of applied impact energy, GFRP lay-up, synthetic foam density and the existence of webs on the impact and post impact behavior of sandwich panels are discussed herein. Analytical models are proposed to predict the residual ultimate edgewise compressive load capacity of sandwich panels with lattice webs after impacts, using energy principles and variational methods in applied mechanics. The influences from impact damage, the local buckling of the facesheets and the confined strength of the foam core are measured and compared well with proposed analytical models.","Tech","University of Manchester"

In particular, this paper presents the development of an integrated model, which links a regional economics social accounting matrix (SAM) model to an ecological model constructed using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software. The impacts on the ecological–economics–social system are examined by varying fishing efforts for four scenarios, including status quo management, fishing effort reduction policy, fishing gear switch policy, and summer closure extension policy. Key results from the predictions (2010-2020) and policy simulations illustrate that the collapse effect is apparent in the status quo scenario. Further, reducing or switching of fishing effort (e.g. elimination of overfishing and reduced habitat disturbance) positively affects the ecosystem and can lead to economic and social welfare gains in the PRE’s economy. The gear switch scenario presents a compromise among the economics, social, and conservation metrics, and also outperforms other scenarios in terms of biomass at the end of the simulation period. The fishing effort reduction policy performs better than the summer closure extension policy in terms of the conservation metrics but does relatively poorly in economic terms.","Tech","University of Manchester"

The paper proposes a computable general equilibrium model that can evaluate changes in the economic and social indicators. This model is connected to an Ecopath with Ecosim model that can simulate the dynamics of an ecosystem. The integrated model is constructed to investigate how different scenarios of fishing effort and catch management reflecting varying levels of input and output in four fishery management simulations result in different states of the socio-economic and ecosystem structure. Four alterative fishing management scenarios are defined, namely: (1) fishing intensity and policies maintain the status quo; (2) fishing vessel reduction is implemented as an input control policy; (3) fishermen are required to transfer to others jobs as an input control policy; and (4) total landing reduction is implemented as an output control policy. The modelling results show that the output control policy has the most positive effect on ecosystem restoration and can increase overall social welfare. The fishermen switching policy leads to the most positive increase in economic indicators, whereas the policy of fishing vessels reduction has a positive effect on ecosystem restoration, but also a considerable, negative impact on the social and economic dimensions. To achieve sustainable utilisation of marine fishery resources, China's fisheries management policies should be developed to enhance total output control and ecosystem reconstruction.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Even though environments impose some constraints on organizations, they still have a range of response. We find that newspapers, in Turkey, have three different identi-ties. One rooted in journalistic values. One rooted in running the newspaper as a business. And one rooted in maintaining its leadership role. These identities trigger three different transitive strategic responses. A transitive response is one in which an organization has an attack and a fall-back position. Further, we show how the link between an organization’s identity and its strategic response is moderated by the dominance of relations with institutional environment and the dominance of relations with technical environment. We tested these ideas in a pilot test with supportive interviews, and then in a large scale quantitative study.","Tech","University of Manchester"

A.; Manville, R.; Popa, O.; Cuello, L.; Goldstein, S.","30 Jun 2020","TOKs are outwardly rectifying K+ channels in fungi with two pore-loops and eight transmembrane spans. Here, we describe the TOKs from four pathogens that cause the majority of life-threatening fungal infections in humans. These TOKs pass large currents only in the outward direction like the canonical isolate from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScTOK), and distinct from other K+ channels. ScTOK, AfTOK1 (Aspergillus fumigatus) and H99TOK (Cryptococcus neoformans grubii) are K+-selective and pass current above the K+ reversal potential. CaTOK (Candida albicans) and CnTOK (Cryptococcus neoformans neoformans) pass both K+ and Na+ and conduct above a reversal potential reflecting the mixed permeability of their selectivity filter. Mutations in CaTOK and ScTOK at sites homologous to those that open the internal gates in classical K+ channels are shown to produce inward TOK currents. A favored model for outward rectification is proposed whereby the reversal potential determines ion occupancy, and thus conductivity, of the selectivity filter gate that is coupled to an imperfectly restrictive internal gate, permitting the filter to sample ion concentrations on both sides of the membrane.","Tech","University of Manchester"

By incorporating the effect of customers’ forward-looking behaviour, this paper offers a parsimonious and original model that captures the dynamics of MGPD in current high-technology markets. We empirically examine the feasibility of using previous MGPD models and our suggested model to explain the market growth of new products from high-technology industries. The results show that the new model exhibits better curve fitting and forecasting performance than the prior MGPD models in the cases of this study. For marketing researchers, our model and its results suggest customers’ forward looking behaviour is perhaps one of the key sales affecting factors that are missing in previous MGPD models in explaining nowadays’ cases. For marketing practitioners, this study offers a valuable tool for marketing strategies in high-tech industries.","Tech","University of Manchester"

At interview, some children were asked to gaze towards either the interviewer's face (IF) or a teddy bear's face (TF), whereas some children were given no gaze instruction. In both the IF and TF conditions, lie-tellers provided significantly fewer details than truth-tellers. A total of 192 adult evaluators then judged the credibility of 10 children's reports from one of the three ‘gaze’ conditions with and without guidance on level of detail. Evaluators discriminated truths from lies successfully when judging children instructed to look at IF, but not when children were asked to gaze towards TF. Evaluators who received guidance demonstrated better discrimination between true and false reports than evaluators who received no such information. ","Tech","University of Manchester"

Based on recent (2001–2015) comprehensive satellite‐based datasets (surface air temperature, land surface temperature, snow cover, daytime and nighttime cloud), this study finds that annual mean surface air temperature warming rates show rapid decrease above 4500 m despite increasing from 2000 to 4500 m. This indicates a reversal in EDW at the highest elevations on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is somehow different from the EDW derived from short‐term land surface temperature presented in an early study. The decrease of warming rate above 4500 m coincides with the elevation at which most of the current solid water resources reside. Thus, their decline may be less rapid than previously thought. Trends in nighttime cloud and snow cover are both correlated with patterns of EDW on the TP, but the leading factor varies on an annual and seasonal basis. Comparing datasets provides important evidence for understanding EDW and its controlling mechanisms in an extreme high‐elevation context.","Tech","University of Manchester"

In particular, an integrated ECOST model is composed of links between an ecological model constructed by Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software and a region Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). Then the costs and benefits of five fishing methods are compared from economic, ecological and social three dimensions base on the ECOST model. The potential effects of fishing effort reduction on fishing communication are explored by a series of dynamic simulations for a 10-year period. Key results from prediction (2005-2015) and policy simulations illustrate that fisheries of PRE are geared toward short-term economic profits at the expense of ecological gains and the whole group of societal benefits associated with fishing. However, the status quo can be improved to better levels by reducing fishing efforts. ","Tech","University of Manchester"

To resolve this controversy, specific information is needed on the implementation of these partnerships by SMEs; an area, that, thus far, has received little academic attention. In this paper, we examine different business functions (production, marketing and sales, purchasing and logistics, research and development (R&D) and finance) within a supply chain partnership. We collected data for each individual function from 279 high-tech SMEs and examined the relationship between the specific types of partnerships and the overall performance of the SMEs. The results indicate that it is only in the area of R&D that partnerships have a significant positive effect on overall firm performance. The results imply that SMEs primarily can benefit from particular types of supply chain partnerships, i.e. R&D partnerships. The results contribute to the debate in the literature by explaining why many SMEs were found not to benefit from these partnerships. We also provide implications for firms and how SMEs can better utilise supply chain management (SCM).","Tech","University of Manchester"

The method of this study follows classification as part of the preprocessing step to determine R&D, engineering, and high-tech industry-related job advertisements. Afterward, we use clustering methods to identify areas where key human capital is required, and investments are made by R&D-oriented companies. The results show that it is possible to identify sector-oriented skill requirements and that the significance of the R&D skills varies. For the case of Turkey, we can clearly show the national human capital and R&D by identifying nine key clusters that indicate R&D progress and directions.","Tech","University of Manchester"

R.; Zhao, J.; Failler, P.; Wang, Y.","9 Sept 2019","Study of fisheries policy has conventionally been limited to partial equilibrium analysis where capture fisheries are considered in an isolated world without connection with the rest of the economy and without endogenous change in prices. This causes a two-way problem in policy analysis in that firstly consequences of fisheries policy cannot spread out of the sector and thus incorporate feedback from the rest of the economy, and secondly any economic policy also cannot affect the fisheries sector. As a result, any policy analysis regarding the fisheries sector cannot be accurate or even correct. This research builds a computable general equilibrium model for Thai fisheries to study full consequences of fisheries or economic policies in Thailand. The model specifies the economic activities of not only capture fisheries but also aquaculture, fish processing and fish marketing sectors as well as the rest of the economy, and captures their interactions. The empirical applications of the model with market-based policy instruments such as fishing taxes and subsidies reveal that fisheries or economic policies aiming to protect the resources or restructure the sector, if properly designed and combined, can achieve their goal as well as avoid potential losses.","Tech","University of Manchester"

However, the evolutionary processes affecting variation at a genomic scale have not been investigated in most vertebrate lineages. Here, we present the first population genomics survey using whole genome resequencing in the green anole (Anolis carolinensis). Anoles have been intensively studied to understand mechanisms underlying adaptation and speciation. The green anole in particular is an important model to study genome evolution. We quantified how demography, recombination, and selection have led to the current genetic diversity of the green anole by using whole-genome resequencing of five genetic clusters covering the entire species range. The differentiation of green anole's populations is consistent with a northward expansion from South Florida followed by genetic isolation and subsequent gene flow among adjacent genetic clusters. Dispersal out-of-Florida was accompanied by a drastic population bottleneck followed by a rapid population expansion. This event was accompanied by male-biased dispersal and/or selective sweeps on the X chromosome. We show that the interaction between linked selection and recombination is the main contributor to the genomic landscape of differentiation in the anole genome.","Tech","University of Manchester"

D.; Bourgeois, Y.; Meheretu, Y.; Boissinot, S.","1 May 2022","Taxon-specific characteristics and extrinsic climatic and geological forces may both shape population differentiation and speciation. In geographically and taxonomically focused investigations, differentiation may occur synchronously as species respond to the same external conditions. Conversely, when evolution is investigated in taxa with largely varying traits, population differentiation and speciation is complex and shaped by interactions of Earth's template and species-specific traits. As such, it is important to characterize evolutionary histories broadly across the tree of life, especially in geographic regions that are exceptionally diverse and under pressures from human activities such as in biodiversity hotspots. Here, using whole-genome sequencing data, we characterize genomic variation in populations of six Ethiopian Highlands forest bird species separated by a lowland biogeographic barrier, the Great Rift Valley (GRV). In all six species, populations on either side of the GRV exhibited significant but varying levels of genetic differentiation. Species’ dispersal ability was negatively correlated with levels of population differentiation. Isolation with migration models indicated varied patterns of population differentiation and connectivity among populations of the focal species. We found that demographic histories—estimated for each individual—varied by both species and population but were consistent between individuals of the same species and sampling region. We found that genomic diversity varied by half an order of magnitude across species, and that this variation could largely be explained by the harmonic mean of effective population size over the past 200,000 years. Overall, we found that even in highly dispersive species like birds, the GRV acts as a substantial biogeographic barrier.","Tech","University of Manchester"

A second experiment investigated evaluators’ perceptions of the credibility of interviewees who spoke in their native or non‐native language.Method: For the first experiment, 52 participants told the truth or lied about their identity during a mock border control interview. All of the participants were interviewed in English, for half of the sample this was their native language, and for the other half of the sample English was not their native tongue. Post‐interview, all participants completed a self‐report questionnaire relating to their perceptions of their interview experience. For the second experiment, 128 participants evaluated the credibility of interviewees from the first experiment. The modality of presentation of interview clips was varied and included ‘Visual and Audio’, ‘Visual Only’, ‘Audio Only’, and ‘Transcript Only’.Results: Non‐native speakers were more likely than native speakers to report being nervous and cognitively challenged during their interviews and were more likely to monitor their own behaviour. Overall, evaluators were better able to distinguish between truth tellers and liars who were speaking in their native language than between truth tellers and liars who were non‐native speakers. Relative to native speakers, there was a smaller truth bias for evaluations of non‐native speakers. When evaluators were considering the non‐native speakers, they achieved higher discrimination accuracy when they were exposed to ‘Visual Only’ or ‘Transcript Only’ presentations than when they were shown the ‘Visual and Audio’ or ‘Audio Only’ interview clips.Conclusions: Self‐reported experiences of a mock border control interview differed dependent on whether interviewees were speaking in their native or non‐native language. Discrimination accuracy was better for native speakers than it was for non‐native speakers and was at its worst when evaluators heard the accents of the non‐native speakers.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Post radiopacity was measured in millimetres of aluminium (mmAl) with reference to an aluminium step wedge. Two extracted contralateral premolars were root filled. After post space preparation, taking the midpoint of the post hole as a reference, each tooth was cut longitudinally into two halves in a mesiodistal direction. On each half, the exposed root dentine was ground flat to the deepest point of the post space, and an even layer of cement was placed and light-cured. To obtain a clinically relevant layer of cement, the material thickness was reduced to 75 μm by grinding with wet abrasive paper. A cement formulation with 30 wt% of filler was tested in one premolar, whilst a formulation with 70 wt% of filler was utilized in the contralateral tooth. Posts were then placed between the two facing root halves of each premolar, and radiopacity was measured in mmAl. Data were analysed using t-test for paired samples (P < 0.05). Results: Radiopacity of posts ranged between 1.44 (ENA Post) and 5.78 mmAl (FibreKleer). In the presence of the more heavily filled cement, significantly higher values of post radiopacity were measured (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The radiopacity of the luting agent contributed to the overall post radiovisibility within the root. Even when the cement with lower filler content was used in combination with the least radiodense dowels, the post was detectable within the root.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Fisheries’ stock assessments have shown a declining population and have led to the implementation of a number of management measures, including a fishing moratorium. This study evaluated the effect of a fishing moratorium on the sustainability of PRE fisheries through an ecosystem approach. Two Ecopath models of the PRE coastal ecosystem in 1998 and 2008 were applied to obtain snapshots of the ecosystem in different periods. An dynamic simulation of the period from 1998 to 2008 was developed using Ecosim based on the assumption that the seasonal moratorium was never applied to the PRE fisheries from 1999 onward, which resulted in the predicted ecosystem of 2008* (the so-called 2008* ecosystem). Then, the attribute indices of the 2008* ecosystem were compared with those of the actual 2008 ecosystem to investigate the effect of the fishing moratorium. Finally, a series of 100 years dynamics simulations was examined according to five scenarios based on the 1998 Ecopath model to explore better strategies for the fishing moratorium. The results show that the 2008* ecosystem was not supposed to feature a seasonal moratorium, as the system in 1999 was more deteriorated, immature and fragile than the actual ecosystem in 2008. The seasonal fishing moratorium did benefit ecosystem protection, although its effect on ecosystem recovery was limited. A comparative analysis of different scenarios indicates that most functional groups will decrease without executing a fishing moratorium(SO). The prolonged moratorium (SO) seemed to be slightly more beneficial to stocks recovery than S0, during which fishing operations were carried out following the present fishing moratorium policy. How-ever, banning all fishing operations during the moratorium season (S3) has little effect on the recovery of fishing stocks from overexploitation. Moreover, reducing the fishing effort by 50% (S4) led to the largest increase in both fish stocks (28.0%) and total landings (43%).","Tech","University of Manchester"

In the realm of nanotechnology, one of the most mature structures is nanowire. This paper is concerned with the technology transfer process in the nanowire field; in particular it examines how patent collaborations occur and how the key actors interact with each other to support this process. This study uses a different methodology than previous studies in terms of patent data extraction. The methodology offers a new taxonomy that could make a significant impact on accurate patent data quests and increase the reliability of patent analyses in emerging fields such as nanotechnology. As patent data are valuable sources of technology innovation data and for forecasting technical change, this study utilises patent network analysis to visualise the actors, clusters and their relationships at the organisational, national and international levels. Overall, this study proposes a new collaborative network model to assist with analysing patenting activities between actors in regard to types of linkages. Different types of linkages between countries and organisations can be found for nanowire-related patenting activities by following the proposed network model. Findings indicate that some nations have highly centralised networks where large organisations dominate most linkages, as in the case of South Korea with regard to Samsung. Nations such as the US and Japan have a more distributed network where academic and industrial players are linked with each other. In the case of China, there were mono-linkages between large organisations such as Foxconn and Tsinghua University, which was the key with regard to collaborative innovation there.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Poor performance of pile foundations remains a great concern to the earthquake engineering community. As a result, pile behaviour in seismically liquefiable area is still an area of active research. This keynote lecture presents the understanding obtained from research carried out by our group. The research is based on scaled model tests (carried out in the shaking table at University of Bristol, Dynamic Centrifuge Tests carried out at Shimizu Corporation, Japan), element test on liquefiable soil samples (both laboratory research sands such as Toyoura, Silica No 8 from Japan, Red Hill, Leighton Buzzard as well as liquefiable sand samples from Ganges river, Brahmaputra rover sand, Assam sand, Sendai sand, Urayasu sand) and back analysis of well documented case studies of pile foundation performance. This paper also compares the current understanding as well theories of the pile failure in liquefiable soils and compares with codes of practice. It has been shown that the current theory of pile failure as mentioned in codes of practice is based on flexural mechanism where the lateral loads on the pile (due to inertia and/or lateral spreading) induce bending failure. However, the current understanding identifies few other mechanisms which may control the pile behaviour and needs consideration during design: (a) Piles are laterally unsupported slender columns (rather than laterally loaded beams) in liquefiable soils and therefore a pile may fail by buckling instability due to axial load alone given the inherent imperfections in a pile; (b) During the process of liquefaction (i.e. soil changing from being solid-like material to a fluid like material), the fundamental period of pile supported structures increases and the damping of the whole system also increases. During the transient phase, tuning effect may occur if the period of the structure comes close to the period of the earthquake causing amplification of bending moment in the pile which may lead to dynamic failure. Provisions proposed by major international codes of practice for pile design including the Japanese Highway Code (JRA) are reviewed.","Tech","University of Manchester"

In this article, I explore the visual grammar and affective logics of two recent prominent public mediations of the war in Afghanistan, both dominated by the use of video footage recorded from camcorders mounted on soldiers' helmets. Epitomized in this helmetcam footage, I suggest that it is through an emerging aesthetic regime of 'somatic war' – that foregrounds sensory immersion and real feeling, vital living and bodily vulnerability – that the endless war in Afghanistan is currently being made perceptible and palpable.","Tech","University of Manchester"

E.; Soltis, P. S.; Wong, G. K. S.; Baker, W. J.; Wickett, N. J.","1 Jul 2019","Sequencing of target-enriched libraries is an efficient and cost-effective method for obtaining DNA sequence data from hundreds of nuclear loci for phylogeny reconstruction. Much of the cost of developing targeted sequencing approaches is associated with the generation of preliminary data needed for the identification of orthologous loci for probe design. In plants, identifying orthologous loci has proven difficult due to a large number of whole-genome duplication events, especially in the angiosperms (flowering plants). We used multiple sequence alignments from over 600 angiosperms for 353 putatively single-copy protein-coding genes identified by the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative to design a set of targeted sequencing probes for phylogenetic studies of any angiosperm group. To maximize the phylogenetic potential of the probes, while minimizing the cost of production, we introduce a k-medoids clustering approach to identify the minimum number of sequences necessary to represent each coding sequence in the final probe set. Using this method, 5-15 representative sequences were selected per orthologous locus, representing the sequence diversity of angiosperms more efficiently than if probes were designed using available sequenced genomes alone. To test our approximately 80,000 probes, we hybridized libraries from 42 species spanning all higher-order groups of angiosperms, with a focus on taxa not present in the sequence alignments used to design the probes. Out of a possible 353 coding sequences, we recovered an average of 283 per species and at least 100 in all species. Differences among taxa in sequence recovery could not be explained by relatedness to the representative taxa selected for probe design, suggesting that there is no phylogenetic bias in the probe set. Our probe set, which targeted 260 kbp of coding sequence, achieved a median recovery of 137 kbp per taxon in coding regions, a maximum recovery of 250 kbp, and an additional median of 212 kbp per taxon in flanking non-coding regions across all species. These results suggest that the Angiosperms353 probe set described here is effective for any group of flowering plants and would be useful for phylogenetic studies from the species level to higher-order groups, including the entire angiosperm clade itself.","Tech","University of Manchester"

A.","19 May 2017","We present constraints on variations in the initial mass function (IMF) of nine local early-type galaxies based on their low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) populations. Comprised of accreting black holes and neutron stars, these LMXBs can be used to constrain the important high-mass end of the IMF. We consider LMXB populations beyond the cores of the galaxies (>0.2R e; covering 75%-90% of their stellar light) and find no evidence for systematic variations of the IMF with velocity dispersion (σ). We reject IMFs which become increasingly bottom-heavy with σ, up to steep power laws (exponent, α > 2.8) in massive galaxies (σ > 300 ), for galactocentric radii >1/4 R e. Previously proposed IMFs that become increasingly bottom-heavy with σ are consistent with these data if only the number of low-mass stars (<0.5 M o) varies. We note that our results are consistent with some recent work which proposes that extreme IMFs are only present in the central regions of these galaxies. We also consider IMFs that become increasingly top-heavy with σ, resulting in significantly more LMXBs. Such a model is consistent with these observations, but additional data are required to significantly distinguish between this and an invariant IMF. For six of these galaxies, we directly compare with published ""IMF mismatch"" parameters from the Atlas3D survey, α dyn. We find good agreement with the LMXB population if galaxies with higher α dyn have more top-heavy IMFs - although we caution that our sample is quite small. Future LMXB observations can provide further insights into the origin of α dyn variations.","Tech","University of Manchester"

R.; Ferrari, M.","1 May 2013","Purpose: To assess the shear bond strength to unground human enamel (ESBS) and flexural strength (FS) of different reinforcing fibers used in combination with a flowable composite resin. Materials and Methods: For ESBS testing, 90 human molars were selected and randomly divided into 9 groups (n = 10) according to the reinforcing fiber to be tested: 1. RTD Quartz Splint additionally impregnated at chairside with Quartz Splint Resin (RTD); 2. RTD Quartz Splint without additional impregnation; 3. Ribbond-THM (Ribbond) impregnated with OptiBond FL Adhesive; 4: Ribbond Triaxial (Ribbond) impregnated with OptiBond FL Adhesive; 5. Connect (Kerr) impregnated with OptiBond FL Adhesive; 6. Construct (Kerr) impregnated with Opti-Bond FL Adhesive; 7. everStick PERIO (Stick Tech); 8. everStick C&B (Stick Tech); 9. nonreinforced composite Premise flowable (Kerr). Cylinders of flowable composite reinforced with the fibers were bonded to the intact buccal surface of the teeth. After 24 h of storage, shear loading was performed until failure occurred. FS was assessed performing three-point bending test according to ISO Standard 4049/2000. ESBS and FS data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s HSD test for post-hoc comparisons (p < 0.05). Results: For each group, the ESBS and FS, respectively, in MPa were: 1. 17.07 ± 4.52 and 472.69 ± 30.49; 2. 14.98 ± 3.92 and 441.77 ± 61.43; 3. 18.59 ± 5.67 and 186.89 ± 43.89; 4. 16.74 ± 6.27 and 314.41 ± 148.52; 5. 14.38 ± 4.14 and 223.80 ± 77.35; 6. 16.00 ± 5.55 and 287.62 ± 85.91; 7. 16.42 ± 3.67 and 285.35 ± 39.68; 8. 23.24 ± 5.81 and 370.46 ± 29.26; 9. 12.58 ± 4.76 and 87.75 ± 22.87. For most fibers, no significant difference in ESBS was found compared to the control group, except for everStick C&B, which yielded higher ESBS. Nonreinforced composite exhibited the lowest FS, while all fibers positively affected the FS. Conclusions: Fiber reinforcement of flowable composite does not affect its ESBS. The flexural strength of FRCs is significantly influenced by fiber composition and pattern.","Tech","University of Manchester"

However, the quality of the data is a significant concern for social media-based analyses. The aim of this study was to mine tweets (microblogs) to explore trends and retrieve ideas for various purposes such as product development, technology and sustainability-oriented considerations. The core methodological approach was to create a classification model to identify tweets that contained an idea. This classification model was used as a pre-processing step so the query results obtained from the application programming interface were cleared from the messages that contained the search terms used in the query but did not contain an idea. The results of this study demonstrate that our method based on text mining, and supervised or semi-supervised classification methods, can extract ideas from social media. The social media data mining process illustrated in our study can be utilised as a decision-making tool to detect innovative ideas or solutions about a product or service and summarise them into meaningful clusters. We believe that our findings are significant for the sustainability, tech mining and innovation management communities.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Since this time much research has shed light on our understanding. Significant amongst these findings is the recognition that in low and medium technology (LMT) intensive industries the traditional science and technology model of innovation is not applicable and cannot explain continued product and process innovations (see Bush, 1945; Maclaurin, 1953; Arrow, 1968; Pavitt, 2001; Fitjar and Rodriguez-Pose, 2013). Further, in the classic article by Pavitt (1984: 343–373) he spelt out, in his typology of firms, that ‘LMT industries are characterised by process, organisational and marketing innovations, by weak internal innovation capabilities and by strong dependencies on the external provision of machines, equipment and software’. LMT sectors are central to economic growth. Whether measured in terms of output, capital invested or employment, they dominate the economies of highly developed as well as developing nations, providing more than ninety percent of output in the European Union, the USA and Japan. Given this dominant position within modern industrialised economies attempting to better understand the nature of innovation within this sector is of concern to policy makers and industrialists.","Tech","University of Manchester"

However, the selection of a standard and effective messaging protocol is a challenging and daunting task for any organisation because it depends on the nature of the IoT system and its messaging requirements. Copious messaging protocols have been developed and employed by various organisations based on their requirements in the last two decades. Though, none of them is able to support all messaging requirements of all types of IoT systems. Messaging protocol is an ongoing dilemma for the IoT industry; consequently, it is important to understand the pros and cons of the widely accepted and emerging messaging protocols for IoT systems to determine their best-fit scenarios. Therefore, this paper presents an evaluation of the four established messaging protocols MQTT, CoAP, AMQP and HTTP for IoT systems. Firstly, it presents the broad comparison among these messaging protocols to introduce their characteristics comparatively. Afterwards, it performs a further in-depth and relative analysis based on some interrelated criteria to gain insight into their strengths and limitations. Thus, based on this detailed evaluation, the user can decide their appropriate usage in various IoT systems according to their requirements and suitability.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Indeed, many MCDMs recognise the need for visualisations during the process of supporting decision making to involve decision makers and in order to help their interactions and outcomes. In such progressive learning phases of MCDM interventions, groups of decision makers may benefit from visual scaffolds to become aware of their own subjective values, to illuminate controversy, and to facilitate debate to build common ground. Yet, our understanding of the efficacy of epistemic processes of reasoning with visualisations is still not well developed. Hence, this paper takes a practice-based view to address the question: How is the creation of common ground for action accomplished through real-time, interactive visualisation of participants’ contributions? Grounded in an activity-theoretical framework, we develop an exploratory approach to understand visualisation affordances and processual demands for visualisation-enabled coordination. Video data was collected during a traditional group model building workshop to capture the participants’ multimodal conceptual reasoning processes involved in encountering, constructing, exploring and questioning low-tech visualisations. It is hoped that the proposed approach to understand visualisations for learning with decision-makers provides a conceptual resource for the reflective design of multi-stage MCDM interventions.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Ideally this means protecting genetically diverse populations and not simply breeding a few individuals. Unfortunately, this point is often overlooked by reproductive technologists, especially if they are more accustomed to working with humans, companion animals or agricultural species, where the goals are more usually directed towards obtaining offspring from particular individuals. This approach has tended to antagonise the conservation community, who are quick to develop an unreasonable suspicion of technological solutions, partly because they are unfamiliar with the scientific principles that underpin the reproductive technology. Unfortunately, this mutual failure to recognise that all parties are actually well meaning, has led to separate cultures that barely communicate with each other and thus fail to capitalise on the potential benefits that would come from a good working relationship. Notable successes with reproductive technology have only emerged where such relationships have been forged. In this review, we highlight, mainly for the benefit of the technologist community, the need to foster good working relationships with conservation managers and to recognise that the latest hi-tech approach to animal breeding is more likely to engender suspicion than enthusiasm.","Tech","University of Manchester"

They reveal that a high shear stiffness of the CNT/polymer interphase is essential to take the full advantage of the load-bearing ability of the inner wall of the DWCNT, and thus enhance the mechanical performance of the nanocomposite. Furthermore the interphase shear stress distributions in interwall and CNT/polymer interphase of a DWCNT point out the relationship between CNT/epoxy interphase damage propagation and shear stress in the interwall phase.","Tech","University of Manchester"

More studies in the literature are considering the thermodynamics of gas hydrate formation both experimentally and mathematically. However, there is no sufficient studies regarding the kinetics of gas hydrates and most of the experimental data and specifically the kinetic models in the literature are incomplete. That may be due to inherent stochastic behavior of GHs which makes it difficult to develop a deterministic model for it. Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods including Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) have been proved as a novel and potential tools with acceptable accuracy for modeling of engineering systems. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the kinetics of gas hydrate formation using ANN and ANFIS when the relation between growth rate of methane hydrate, temperature and pressure has been modeled. Moreover, this can also be achieved using complicated governing equations but AI provides a less complex and easier way to accomplish this goal. Experimental data considering the methane hydrate growth rate as a function of pressure and temperature were used and ANFIS as well as ANN were employed to duplicate them. In this study, the results reveal that ANIFS could better predict the methane hydrate growth rate in the prevailing pressure and temperature conditions compared to ANN. Generally this study shows the effectiveness of AI based techniques for kinetics modeling of gas hydrates formation.","AI","University of Manchester"

This is needed as the frontier of AI application to decision-making is moving in many management areas from operational to strategic. Given the competitive nature of such decisions and the insights from applying AI to defence and similar areas, it is time to focus on applying AI to strategic marketing decisions.Research limitations/implications: Applying AI to strategic marketing decision-making is known to be taking place, but the it is commercially sensitive, so data is not available to the authors.Practical implications: There are strong implications for all businesses, particularly large businesses in competitive industries, where failure to deploy AI in the face of competition from firms who have deployed AI to improve their decision-making could be dangerous.Social implications: The public sector is a very important marketing decision-maker. Although in most cases it does not operate competitively, it must still make decisions about making different services available to different citizens and identify the risks of not providing services to certain citizens, so this article is relevant to the public sector.Originality/value: This is one of the first articles to probe deployment of AI in strategic marketing decision-making.","AI","University of Manchester"
"A molecular phylogeny of wood-borers (Teredinidae) from Japanese tsunami marine debris","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/a-molecular-phylogeny-of-wood-borers-teredinidae-from-japanese-ts","Treneman, N.; Borges, L.; Shipway, R.; Raupach, M.; Altermark, B.; Carlton, J.","20 Feb 2018","The family Teredinidae (shipworms) contains 70-plus species of boring bivalves specialized to live in and digest wood. Traditional means of species identification and taxonomy of this group encounter numerous challenges, often compounded by the diverse and dynamic nature of shipworm ecology and distribution. Modern integrative taxonomic methods are shedding new light on this complex group, from delineating cryptic species to resolving phylogenetic relationships within the family. This study reported new sequence data from shipworm species rafted from the western to eastern Pacific Ocean in woody marine debris resulting from the Japanese tsunami of 2011. Eight species of shipworms were found in this debris and tissue from five species was collected. Partial nuclear ribosomal 18S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from Bankia bipennata (Turton, 1819), Bankia carinata (Gray, 1827), Psiloteredo sp., Teredora princesae (Sivickis, 1928), and Teredothyra smithi (Bartsch, 1927). A 658 base pair fragment of COI was successfully sequenced from Psiloteredo sp. and T. princesae specimens from tsunami debris, as well as Psiloteredo megotara (Hanley, 1848) from Europe and Nototeredo norvagica (Spangler, 1792) from Scandinavia. Psiloteredo sp. is very similar morphologically to the North Atlantic Ocean P. megotara; however, these two species are genetically distinct with a 12.8% K2P distance in their COI sequences. The transport of shipworms across the North Pacific Ocean in woody debris generated by a tsunami shows that major geologic events can connect previously isolated geographic areas and provide the opportunity for the establishment of invasive species and subsequent speciation.","AI","University of Manchester"

Wood boring shipworms (Bivalvia: Teredinidae) were either already present in, or settled on, the wooden fraction of this debris, offering a unique opportunity to study shipworm diversity in rafted wood of a known origin and time of ocean entry. Lumber and other wood began appearing on Central Pacific (Hawaiian Islands) and Eastern Pacific beaches in 2013. Eighty pieces of wood Japanese Tsunami Marine Debris (JTMD) consisting of construction beams, trees, milled logs, and wood from vessels or maritime structures were analyzed. Six shipworm species resident in the coastal waters of Japan were found: Bankia bipennata (Turton, 1819), Bankia carinata (Gray, 1827), Teredothyra smithi (Bartsch, 1927), Psiloteredo sp., Lyrodus takanoshimensis (Roch, 1929), and Teredo navalis Linnaeus, 1758. Two pelagic species, Teredora princesae (Sivickis, 1928) and Uperotus clava (Gmelin, 1791), were acquired by JTMD wood in the transoceanic voyage. Several of these wood items were discovered soon after stranding and contained live shipworms. Up to five shipworm species were found in any one wooden object. The present work represents the first study of the diversity and abundance of shipworms transported across an ocean basin in a large woody debris field.","AI","University of Manchester"

E.; Hu, Y.; Copp, G. H.","Mar 2022","Plasticity in growth and life-history traits is an important attribute of non-native (NN) fishes, facilitating their adaptation to novel environments. Few studies have investigated geographical variations in multiple biological traits and the factors affecting the variations. In this study, variations in multiple biological traits of NN Pterygoplichthys spp. were investigated in the main river basins of the Guangdong and Hainan provinces of South China. The impacts of environmental factors on the biological traits were analysed using general linear modeling and an information-theoretic approach. Among-basin differences in population growth was observed, with richness of competitor fishes negatively affecting growth, maturity and reproductive traits – this suggests biotic resistance was mediated by competition with native fishes. These traits were positively affected by total phosphorus concentration, which is indicative of bottom-up effects, mediated by inorganic nutrients, potentially playing an important role in the invasion success of NN fish. In population level, a bet-hedging strategy was observed in Pterygoplichthys spp. under unfavourable environment conditions (e.g. Nangdujiang), whereas a ‘master-of-some’strategy was found under favourable conditions (e.g. Pearl River Delta and Western Basin). The results suggested that plasticity in multiple biological traits of Pterygoplichthys spp. is an important strategy to overcome changing environmental conditions in different rivers, and habitat-specific variations across river basins would reflect trade-offs amongst traits at the population level. Therefore, habitat-specific management measures, adapted to the invaded ecosystem’s features and the life-history strategy of the NN species, could provide an effective means to control invasive species.","AI","University of Manchester"

This is why we see teams of highly specialised engineers in industries such as aerospace, nuclear and subsurface. Condition based monitoring is also employed to maximise the efficiency of extensive maintenance programmes instead of using periodic maintenance. A level of automation is often required in such complex engineering platforms in order to effectively and safely manage them. Advances in Artificial Intelligence related technologies have offered greater levels of automation but this potentially pivots the weight of decision making away from the operator to the machine. Implementing AI or complex algorithms into a platform can mean that the Operators’ control over the system is diminished or removed altogether. For example, in the Boeing 737 Air Max Disaster, AI had been added to a platform and removed the operators’ control of the system. This meant that the operator could not then move outside the extremely reserved, algorithm defined, “envelope” of operation. This paper analyses the challenges of AI driven condition based monitoring where there is a potential to see similar consequences to those seen in control engineering. As the future of society becomes more about algorithm driven technology, it is prudent to ask, not only whether we should implement AI into complex systems, but how this can be achieved ethically and safely in order to reduce risk to life.","AI","University of Manchester"

On the other hand, students need a full appreciation of the importance of AI and a clear recognition of the penalties for flouting the regulations in order to steer a successful passage through higher education and on into their professional career. By repurposing learning materials originally developed by the Pennsylvania State University (USA), the Universities of Southampton and Leeds (UK) have developed academic integrity guidelines to support students in their studies and provide an assessment of their understanding of AI concepts. This chapter describes the development of these learning activities and examines the technical and content issues of repurposing materials for three different institutions.

As a result, it is vital for business managers to acquire knowledge from data and information processing in order to make informed decisions and performing their roles effectively and efficiently. However, managers face significant challenges in data and information processing, which includes acquiring, analysing, and making sense of big data, due to the volume, variety, velocity and veracity of big data. It is argued that the new development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the great potential in supporting and/or replacing managers’ information processing activities. However, there is very limited research on understanding the applications of AI in information processing from a business manager’s perspective. This paper reports an empirical investigation that aims to address this knowledge gap. The study focuses on investigate data and information processing challenges in the era of big data faced by business managers and their perceptions on the role AI in information processing. To achieve the research aim, a large questionnaire survey is used to collect data with UK business managers. The paper will report the key findings on the identified challenges, the managers perceived role of AI in the information processing process and their willingness to use AI in assisting their information processing activities. The paper will highlight the important implication of the findings for research and practice.","AI","University of Manchester"

There are various frameworks and conceptual journeys one should take to ensure a robust AI product; context is one of the vital parts of this. AI is now expected to make decisions, from deciding who gets a credit card to cancer diagnosis. These decisions affect most, if not all, of society. As developers if we do not understand or use fundamental modelling principles then we can cause real harm to society. Recently more serious effects of AI have been observed. Dehumanisation is the human reaction to overused anthropomorphism and lack of social contact caused by excessive interaction with, or addiction to, technology. This can cause humans to devalue technology and to devalue other humans. This is a contradiction of the use of ‘social robots’ and ‘chatbots’, indicating that the negative effects of this technology would outweigh any perceived positive effects. Also, within cyberspace, anthropomorphism and similar techniques based on deep philosophical principles can, and are, being used to alter the behaviour of humans. These techniques are used to manipulate human behaviours at a basic level in the human mind. As these types of techniques are becoming more widespread, it is clear that we are entering unchartered territory that holds a vast array of consequences for society.","AI","University of Manchester"

Data were collected using an online survey from 22 local and 41 international audit firms to achieve these research objectives. Participants were either the auditing manager, audit partners, senior auditors or other personnel who may have experience in the field of accounting and auditing. To test our hypotheses, data analysis was undertaken using reliability and validity tests, descriptive analysis and independent samples t-test. We found that the analysis shows that there is a non-significant difference in the perceived contribution of AI to audit quality between local and international audit firms.

M.; Marinescu, M.; Wu, B.; Richardson, G.","19 Jul 2022","Physics-based electrochemical battery models derived from porous electrode theory are a very powerful tool for understanding lithium-ion batteries, as well as for improving their design and management. Different model fidelity, and thus model complexity, is needed for different applications. For example, in battery design we can afford longer computational times and the use of powerful computers, while for real-time battery control (e.g. in electric vehicles) we need to perform very fast calculations using simple devices. For this reason, simplified models that retain most of the features at a lower computational cost are widely used. Even though in the literature we often find these simplified models posed independently, leading to inconsistencies between models, they can actually be derived from more complicated models using a unified and systematic framework. In this review, we showcase this reductive framework, starting from a high-fidelity microscale model and reducing it all the way down to the single particle model, deriving in the process other common models, such as the Doyle–Fuller–Newman model. We also provide a critical discussion on the advantages and shortcomings of each of the models, which can aid model selection for a particular application. Finally, we provide an overview of possible extensions to the models, with a special focus on thermal models. Any of these extensions could be incorporated into the microscale model and the reductive framework re-applied to lead to a new generation of simplified, multi-physics models.","AI","University of Manchester"

It was originally found in the West African rainforest belt, and was introduced to the research community in the 1990s. The major strains thus far known include the Nigerian and Ivory Coast strains. However, due to its short history as an experimental animal, the genetic relationship among the various strains has not yet been clarified, and establishment of inbred strains has not yet been achieved. Since 2003 the Institute for Amphibian Biology (IAB), Hiroshima University has maintained stocks of multiple X. tropicalis strains and conducted consecutive breeding as part of the National BioResource Project. In the present study we investigated the inbreeding ratio and genetic relationship of four inbred strains at IAB, as well as stocks from other institutions, using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and mitochondrial haplotypes. Our results show successive reduction of heterozygosity in the genome of the IAB inbred strains. The Ivory Coast strains clearly differed from the Nigerian strains genetically, and three subgroups were identified within both the Nigerian and Ivory Coast strains. It is noteworthy that the Ivory Coast strains have an evolutionary divergent genetic background. Our results serve as a guide for the most effective use of X. tropicalis strains, and the long-term maintenance of multiple strains will contribute to further research efforts.","AI","University of Manchester"

This is being pursued with the goal of increasing productivity, whilst reducing costs. With this, it is perceived that the jobs within these organizations that are considered subject to ‘routine’, or repetitive and mundane tasks, are more likely to be automatable. However, it may be recognised that these jobs are more than a simple set of routine tasks. This study aims to address the concept of routineness from the perspective of the job occupants themselves. The findings reveal that jobs which are considered routine from an organizational perspective, realistically require a degree of human intervention. This suggests that the fear of mass unemployment at the hands of AI may be an unrealistic notion. Rather, the introduction of AI into jobs paves the way for collaborative methods of working which could augment current jobs and create new jobs. Furthermore, this paper accentuates that the acceptance of AI by stakeholders requires an alignment of the technology with their own unique contextual needs.","AI","University of Manchester"

G.; Reid, I.","5 Jan 2023","Secure software development has become an increasingly important focus for research in recent years, not least because of advances in technology such as AI, machine learning (AI/ML), robotics, and autonomous systems (RAS). AI/ML and RAS facilitate automated decision-making and have the capability to have a significant impact on society. As such this technology needs to be trustworthy, and secure software development is a key attribute for trustworthiness. Software developers frequently have responsibility and accountability for delivering secure code but limited authority over how this is achieved. Authority tends to lie with cyber security professionals who mandate security processes, tools and training, often with limited success. Our research objective was to better understand how to bridge this gap between software developers and cyber security practitioners so that authority, responsibility and accountability are shared equally. We took inspiration from healthcare research that looks at the relationship between compliance, adherence and concordance. We use this research as a lens through which to analyse qualitative data from 35 interviews with professional software developers. Our research suggests that if software developers and cyber security professionals move to a point of concordance in their interactions it could lead to the negotiation of more realistic cyber security solutions, as well as removing friction from the practice of software developers and ultimately lead to more secure and trustworthy systems.","AI","University of Manchester"

An earlier study found pronounced differences between the calling rates of Bornean orangutans, which showed an almost unimodal call distribution with its peak at mid-morning, and those of Sumatran orangutans, which showed a bimodal call distribution with a distinct calling peak at predawn and a more moderate peak near dusk (MacKinnon 1974). Our findings from Batang Ai resemble more closely the pattern reported for Sumatra than those reported for other Bornean localities and, therefore, contradict earlier reports suggesting a Sumatra-Borneo dichotomy in orangutan call distribution. In addition, orangutans in Batang Ai were heard to regularly emit long calls throughout the night. This behaviour is unusual for a diurnal species.","AI","University of Manchester"

NPCs struggle greatly to portray flexible or creative behaviours within an adaptive or procedurally generated environment and this is even more apparent in their relationship with sound. This paper posits that recent theoretical developments in cognitive psychology offer significant opportunity to advance NPC-AI and proposes that an intelligence framework, based upon Sonic Virtuality and integrated within an NPC, would offer distinct advantages over current systems. To illustrate this vision, a roadmap for future work is laid out using Sonic Virtuality as the foundation for a ‘synthetic listener’; an NPC capable of responding to procedurally generated and external (player-domain) audio. As a philosophical exploration, underlying principles are considered for other perception modalities, presenting an avenue of games-AI research that, ultimately, could dramatically improve NPC- ‘humanness’ and evoke a player-immersion and presence equivalent to linear/fixed AI but in much bigger, more complex virtual worlds.","AI","University of Manchester"

Heat-shock 70-kDa protein 8 (HSPA8), found within the oviduct, prolongs boar, ram and bull sperm survival at body temperatures in vitro. Here, we aimed to determine whether supplementing extenders (INRA-96 and RSD-1) with HSPA8 (4 µg mL–1) would improve their performance in maintaining freshly collected ram sperm viability and sperm nuclear DNA integrity during storage over 48 h at 17°C. Sperm function was assessed at 1, 6, 24 and 48 h and this experiment was repeated using 25 × 106 and 800 × 106 spermatozoa mL–1. INRA96 supplemented with HSPA8 maintained sperm viability significantly better than INRA96 alone at both sperm concentrations. However, sperm nuclear DNA fragmentation (DF) increased significantly during storage using the higher sperm concentration, irrespective of the extender and the protein treatment used. Increasing levels of sperm nuclear DF over time could explain why poor fertility rates are often observed following cervical AI using stored ram semen. However, further research is required to ascertain whether supplementing the commercially available INRA96 extender with HSPA8 will improve fertility rates following cervical AI using stored ram semen.","AI","University of Manchester"

One striking finding is that repeated items seem to last for less time than novel or rare ones. This link between the processing of stimulus identity and the perception of stimulus duration has important implications for theories of timing, and for broader accounts of the organization, purpose, and neural basis of perception. Here, we examine the nature and basis of the repetition effect on subjective duration. Contrary to unitary accounts which equate repetition effects with implicit expectations about forthcoming stimuli, new work suggests that first-order repetition and second-order repetition–expectations differentially affect the perception of time. We survey emerging evidence from behavioural studies of time perception and neuroscientific studies of stimulus encoding which support this view, and outline key questions for the future.","AI","University of Manchester"

When considered in isolation, neither objective nor subjective socioeconomic status (SES) was meaningfully associated with prosociality. However, because people who believe themselves to be at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy are typically low in PRD, these variables act as mutual suppressors—the predictive validity of both is enhanced when they are considered simultaneously, revealing that both higher subjective SES and higher PRD are associated with lower prosociality. These results cast new light on the complex connections between relative social status and people’s willingness to act for the benefit of others.","AI","University of Manchester"

When the hands were far apart, the response time costs associated with attending to the wrong hand were reduced when attention had to be shifted along one object jointly held by both hands compared to when it was shifted over the same distance but across separate objects. Similar reductions in attentional costs were observed when the hands were placed closer together, suggesting that processing at one hand is less prioritized over that at another when the hands can be “grouped” by virtue of arising from the same spatial location or from the same object. Probes of perceived hand locations throughout the task showed that holding a common object decreased attentional separability without decreasing the perceived separation between the hands. Our findings suggest that tactile events at the hands may be represented in a spatial framework that flexibly adapts to (object-guided) attentional demands, while their relative coordinates are simultaneously preserved.","AI","University of Manchester"

This study has investigated data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting all three outcomes after elective cancer surgery.Methods: A prospectively maintained colorectal cancer database was used, covering 4336 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery between 2003 and 2019. The 33 patient parameters included demographics, peri- and postoperative outcomes, surgical approaches, complications and mortality. Ten data analytics and AI algorithms were compared. Extra tree regressor/classifier, LASSO algorithms, and correlation matrix with heat map were investigated to identify the most important parameters. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for validation.Results: The significant predictors of LoS were age, ASA grade, operative time, presence or absence of a stoma, robotic or laparoscopic approach to surgery, complications, and operation type. The model with support vector regressor (SVR) algorithms predicted the LoS with an accuracy of 83% and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 12.52 days. The significant predictors of mortality were age, ASA grade, BMI, laparoscopic procedure, formation of a stoma, preop T Stage, preop M Stage, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, curative resection, and LoS. Bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) outperformed other algorithms. It predicted mortality with 80% accuracy (or 78% using only the parameters identified as important), 84% sensitivity and 75% specificity. The model predicted the 31 days mortality with 96% accuracy, 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The prediction of the 91 days mortality was possible with 94% accuracy, 91% sensitivity and 96% specificity.A Bi-LSTM model predicted readmission with 87.5% accuracy, 84% sensitivity and 90%. specificity.Conclusions: This study demonstrates how AI can help clinicians in the prediction of LoS, readmission, and mortality after colorectal cancer surgery. Accuracies of at least 80% were achieved.","AI","University of Manchester"

I.; Callan, M. J.","1 Jan 2016","People typically overestimate how much others are prepared to pay for consumer goods and services. We investigated the extent to which latent beliefs about others’ affluence contribute to this overestimation. In Studies 1, 2a, and 2b we found that participants, on average, judge the other people taking part in the study to “have more money” and “have more disposable income” than themselves. The extent of these beliefs positively correlated with the overestimation of willingness to pay (WTP). Study 3 shows that the link between income-beliefs and WTP is causal, and Studies 4, 5a, and 5b show that it holds in a between-group design with a real financial transaction and is unaffected by accuracy incentives. Study 6 examines estimates of others’ income in more detail and, in conjunction with the earlier studies, indicates that participants’ reported beliefs about others’ affluence depend upon the framing of the question. Together, the data indicate that individual differences in the overestimation effect are partly due to differing affluence-beliefs, and that an overall affluence-estimation bias may contribute to the net tendency to overestimate other people’s willingness to pay.","AI","University of Manchester"

"Further evidence that the effects of repetition on subjective time depend on repetition probability","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/further-evidence-that-the-effects-of-repetition-on-subjective-tim","Skylark, W. J.; Gheorghiu, A. I.","1 Nov 2017","Repeated stimuli typically have shorter apparent duration than novel stimuli. Most explanations for this effect have attributed it to the repeated stimuli being more expected or predictable than the novel items, but an emerging body of work suggests that repetition and expectation exert distinct effects on time perception. The present experiment replicated a recent study in which the probability of repetition was varied between blocks of trials. As in the previous work, the repetition effect was smaller when repeats were common (and therefore more expected) than when they were rare. These results add to growing evidence that, contrary to traditional accounts, expectation increases apparent duration whereas repetition compresses subjective time, perhaps via a low-level process like adaptation. These opposing processes can be seen as instances of a more general “processing principle,” according to which subjective time is a function of the perceptual strength of the stimulus representation, and therefore depends on a confluence of “bottom-up” and “top-down” variables.","AI","University of Manchester"
"Personal health records an approach to answer: what works for whom in what circumstances?","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/personal-health-records-an-approach-to-answer-what-works-for-whom","Andrikopoulou, E.; Scott, P.","20 Apr 2022","National Health Service (NHS) policy suggests that increasing usage of electronic personal health records (PHR) by patients will result in cost savings and improved public health, especially for people with long-term conditions. PHR design features are inevitably important, since a good PHR design should make theusers achieve their health goals effortlessly, which is understandable and usable. Three original theoretical models were developed using realist evaluation, one per long-term condition cohort, describing the interaction between the PHR design features and the patient and disease specific factors, to help determine what worksfor whom in what circumstances.","AI","University of Manchester"
"Deep learning approach to assess damage mechanics of bone tissue","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/deep-learning-approach-to-assess-damage-mechanics-of-bone-tissue","Shen, S. C. Y.; Peña Fernández, M.; Tozzi, G.; Buehler, M. J.","1 Nov 2021","Machine learning methods have the potential to transform imaging techniques and analysis for healthcare applications with automation, making diagnostics and treatment more accurate and efficient, as well as to provide mechanistic insights into tissue deformation and fracture in physiological and pathological conditions. Here we report an exploratory investigation for the classification and prediction of mechanical states of cortical and trabecular bone tissue using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), residual neural networks (ResNet), and transfer learning applied to a novel dataset derived from high-resolution synchrotron-radiation micro-computed tomography (SR-microCT) images acquired in uniaxial continuous compression in situ. We present the systematic optimization of CNN architectures for classification of this dataset, visualization of class-defining features detected by the CNNs using gradient class activation maps (Grad-CAMs), comparison of CNN performance with ResNet and transfer learning models, and perhaps most critically, the challenges that arose from applying machine learning methods to an experimentally-derived dataset for the first time. With optimized CNN architectures, we obtained trained models that classified novel images between failed and pristine classes with over 98% accuracy for cortical bone and over 90% accuracy for trabecular bone. Harnessing a pre-trained ResNet with transfer learning, we further achieved over 98% accuracy on the cortical dataset, and 99% on the trabecular dataset. This demonstrates that powerful classifiers for high-resolution SR-microCT images can be developed even with few unique training samples and invites further development through the inclusion of more data and training methods to move towards novel, fundamental, and machine learning-driven insights into microstructural states and properties of bone.","AI","University of Manchester"
"Linear regression trust management system for IoT systems","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/linear-regression-trust-management-system-for-iot-systems","Subramanian, A. K.; Samanta, A.; Manickam, S.; Kumar, A.; Shiaeles, S.; Mahendran, A.","1 Dec 2021","This paper aims at creating a new Trust Management System (TMS) for a system of nodes. Various systems already exist which only use a simple function to calculate the trust value of a node. In the age of artificial intelligence the need for learning ability in an Internet of Things (IoT) system arises. Malicious nodes are a recurring issue and there still has not been a fully effective way to detect them beforehand. In IoT systems, a malicious node is detected after a transaction has occurred with the node. To this end, this paper explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Linear Regression (LR), could be utilised to predict a malicious node in order to minimise the damage in the IoT ecosystem. Moreover, the paper compares Linear regression over other AI-based TMS, showing the efficiency and efficacy of the method to predict and identify a malicious node. ","AI","University of Manchester"
"Use of artificial intelligence in room acoustics prediction using a photograph","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-room-acoustics-prediction-using","Milne, D.; Davison, L.; Ausiello, L.","30 Nov 2020","Current methods of determining acoustical parameters must adhere to current standards, require necessary training, include high equipment costs, and is time-consuming. The estimation of acoustics through calculation diminishes some issues with acoustics measurement but can be less accurate. It can be difficult for individuals and businesses in the acoustics field to consider RT60 despite its importance as an influential acoustic parameter which arguably cannot be assumed, especially within educational spaces. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a program capable of performing tasks normally requiring human intelligence (see section 2.2) and has reached a maturity wherein it can now apply to real-world tasks that were not previously feasible within industries. AIs might reduce costs as they can reduce the time needed to complete a task and reduce the number of resources required. AIs require data, and in most cases, data acquisition, such as images, video, or text, only needs to happen once which can then allow a range of applications including image identification. As a proof of concept, this project aims to investigate if it is possible to create an alternative method for determining RT60 using AI.","AI","University of Manchester"
"Facial appearance affects science communication","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/facial-appearance-affects-science-communication","Gheorghiu, A. I.; Callan, M. J.; Skylark, W. J.","6 Jun 2017","First impressions based on facial appearance predict many important social outcomes. We investigated whether such impressions also influence the communication of scientific findings to lay audiences, a process that shapes public beliefs, opinion, and policy. First, we investigated the traits that engender interest in a scientist’s work, and those that create the impression of a “good scientist” who does high-quality research. Apparent competence and morality were positively related to both interest and quality judgments, whereas attractiveness boosted interest but decreased perceived quality. Next, we had members of the public choose real science news stories to read or watch and found that people were more likely to choose items that were paired with “interesting-looking” scientists, especially when selecting video-based communications. Finally, we had people read real science news items and found that the research was judged to be of higher quality when paired with researchers who look like “good scientists.” Our findings offer insights into the social psychology of science, and indicate a source of bias in the dissemination of scientific findings to broader society.","AI","University of Manchester"

They permit a tele-operator to be included in the steering as much as possible, while offering help when required to avoid obstacles and to reach their target destination. The direction to a destination (via point) becomes an extra input along with the usual inputs from a joystick and an obstacle avoidance sensor system. A recommended direction is suggested and that is mixed with joystick position and angle. A rule-based system provides a suggested angle to turn the robot and that is mixed with input from a joystick to help a tele-operator to steer their mobile robot towards a destination.","AI","University of Manchester"
"Recovery of infauna macrobenthic invertebrates in oil-polluted tropical soft-bottom tidal flats: 7 years post spill","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/recovery-of-infauna-macrobenthic-invertebrates-in-oil-polluted-tr","Nwipie, G. N.; Hart, A. I.; Zabbey, N.; Sam, K.; Prpich, G.; Kika, P. E.","1 Aug 2019","Coastal oil spills constitute significant threat to biotic energy distribution, and biodiversity integrity amongst others. This study monitored the recovery of low-intertidal, soft-bottom infauna macrobenthic invertebrates in Bodo Creek intermittently over a 7-year period post oil spill. Samples were taken twice a month (spring and neap low tides) for 6 months (September 2015–February 2016) at sites previously studied (pre-spill baseline studies, 3-year and 5-year post-spill studies) for the effects of oil pollution using the same sampling methods used during initial studies of the same area. Comparatively, the initial studies reported Polychaeta as the dominant class against the dominant Crustacea reported in this 7-year post-spill study, indicating a change in the community structure of the study area. Infauna macro-invertebrate communities recorded showed an improvement (that is, increased species richness and number of individuals) over the initial 3-year and 5-year post-spill studies. However, relating the results to the initial baseline pre-spill studies, an annual average of 9.7% recovery rate was observed. Analysis of results showed that the total hydrocarbon content (THC) of the sediment remained high (90.08–12,184 mg/kg) but was markedly lower than levels observed during the initial post-spill study (6422–7186 mg/kg). Tidal flushing and biodegradation processes were deemed responsible for the reduction in THC. This study provides a rare dataset that describes the effects of oil pollution on a previously near-pristine estuarine environment in the tropics.","AI","University of Manchester"
"Social comparison processes in the experience of personal relative deprivation","https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/social-comparison-processes-in-the-experience-of-personal-relativ","Kim, H.; Callan, M. J.; Gheorghiu, A. I.; Skylark, W. J.","1 Sept 2018","Drawing on social comparison and equity theories, we investigated the role that perceived similarity of a comparison target plays in how resentful people feel about their relative financial status. In Study 1, participants tended to choose a comparison target who was better off, and they selected a target they perceived to be more similar than dissimilar along dimensions that surrounded their financial outcomes. In Study 1, perceived relative disadvantage was positively associated with resentment regardless of the perceived similarity of the comparison target. The results of Studies 2 to 5b clarified these findings by showing that being both similar and dissimilar to a target can cause resentment depending on the context. Using hypothetical and real social comparisons, we found that people are more dissatisfied with their financial outcomes when their comparative targets have the same background qualifications (i.e., are similar) but are financially better off (Studies 2, 3b, 4, and 5b). However, we also found that when the comparative financial contexts were similar (i.e., equal affluence), participants were more dissatisfied when their target for comparison had lower qualifications (i.e., was dissimilar; Studies 2, 3a, 4, and 5a). In all cases, perceptions of unfairness mediated the effects of social comparison on financial dissatisfaction. Taken together, these studies address some of the ambiguities around what it means to be similar to a target in the context of social comparisons of affluence, and they underscore the importance of perceived unfairness in the link between social comparison and resentment with one's financial status.","AI","University of Manchester"
