Computations agree well with experimental data of the bare rotor but indicate that three-dimensional unsteadiness means that a strictly 2-dimensional idealization produces too high lift and too low drag. The addition of discs, while leading toapparently negative drag coefficients, does not produce the striking rise in lift coefficients that Thom’s experiments had shown. Moreover, the great increase in torque coefficients associated with adding discs seemsto exclude their use in sea-going propulsion applications.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

S.; Wang, J.; Ruxton, T.; Yang, J. B.; Liu, J.","2004","Safety assessment based on conventional methods such as probability risk assessment (PRA) may not be well suited for dealing with innovative systems having a high level of uncertainty, particularly in the feasibility and concept design stages of a maritime engineering system. By contrast, safety models using fuzzy logic approaches employing fuzzy IF-THEN rules can model the qualitative aspects of human knowledge and reasoning processes without employing precise quantitative analyses. Fuzzy-logic-based approaches may be more appropriately used to carry out risk analysis in the initial design stages of large maritime engineering systems. This provides a tool for working directly with the linguistic terms commonly used in carrying out safety assessment. This paper focuses on the development and representation of linguistic variables to model risk levels subjectively. These variables are then quantified using fuzzy set theory. In this paper, the development of two safety evaluation frameworks using fuzzy logic approaches for maritime engineering safety-based decision support in the concept design stage are presented. An example is used to illustrate and compare the proposed approaches. Future risk analysis in maritime engineering applications may take full advantages of fuzzy logic approaches to complement existing ones.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.; Gunasekaran, A.; Tiwari, M. K.","8 Mar 2017","Maritime inventory routing problem is addressed in this paper to satisfy the demand at different ports during the planning horizon. It explores the possibilities of integrating slow steaming policy as mentioned in Kontovas et al. (2011) and Norstad et al. (2011) within ship routing. A mixed integer non-linear programming model is presented considering various scheduling and routing constraints, loading/unloading constraints and vessel capacity constraints. Non-linear equation between fuel consumption and vessel speed has been incorporated to capture the sustainability aspects. Several time window constraints are inculcated in the mathematical model to enhance the service level at each port. Penalty costs are incurred if the ship arrives early before the starting of the time window or if it finishes its operation after the ending of the time window. Costs associated with the violation of time window helps in maintaining a proper port discipline. Now, owing to the inherent complexity of the aforementioned problem, an effective search heuristics named Particle Swarm Optimization for Composite Particle (PSO-CP) is employed. Particle Swarm Optimization – Differential Evolution (PSO-DE), Basic PSO and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are used to validate the result obtained from PSO-CP. Computational results provided for different problem instances shows the superiority of PSO-CP over the other algorithms in terms of the solution obtained.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

After providing an ethnographic account of the contemporary place of the sea in local discourses of Hunchun’s identity, I draw on archival material to analyze the politico-linguistic history of maritime affairs in this part of China and beyond. I examine how the notion yang (ocean/foreign) transformed from being a label of foreign interventions in China to serving as a metaphor for domestic economic progress. The sea is both a distant dream and a source of concrete developmental potential for Hunchun today. It is also an optic through which to observe the town’s future.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

A.; Newsham, K. K.; Cox, F.; Garnett, M. H.; Robinson, C. H.; Dungait, J. A. J.","Feb 2020","We report a space-for-time substitution study predicting the impacts of climate change on vegetated maritime Antarctic soils. Analyses of soils from under Deschampsia antarctica sampled from three islands along a 2,200 km climatic gradient indicated that those from sub-Antarctica had higher moisture, organic matter and carbon (C) concentrations, more depleted δ13C values, lower concentrations of the fungal biomarker ergosterol and higher concentrations of bacterial PLFA biomarkers and plant wax n-alkane biomarkers than those from maritime Antarctica. Shallow soils (2 cm depth) were wetter, and had higher concentrations of organic matter, ergosterol and bacterial PLFAs, than deeper soils (4 cm and 8 cm depths). Correlative analyses indicated that factors associated with climate change (increased soil moisture, C and organic matter concentrations, and depleted δ13C contents) are likely to give rise to increases in Gram negative bacteria, and decreases in Gram positive bacteria and fungi, in maritime Antarctic soils. Bomb-14C analyses indicated that sub-Antarctic soils at all depths contained significant amounts of modern 14C (C fixed from the atmosphere post c. 1955), whereas modern 14C was restricted to depths of 2 cm and 4 cm in maritime Antarctica. The oldest C (c. 1,745 years BP) was present in the southernmost soil. The higher nitrogen (N) concentrations and δ15N values recorded in the southernmost soil were attributed to N inputs from bird guano. Based on these analyses, we conclude that 5–8 °C rises in air temperature, together with associated increases in precipitation, are likely to have substantial impacts on maritime Antarctic soils, but that, at the rates of climate warming predicted under moderate greenhouse gas emission scenarios, these impacts are likely to take at least a century to manifest themselves.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Exploring the vulnerability of transportation networks by entropy: A case study of Asia–Europe maritime transportation network","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/exploring-the-vulnerability-of-transportation-networks-by-entropy","Wen, T.; Gao, Q.; Chen, Y-W.; Cheong, K. H.","1 Oct 2022","With the rise of global trade, maritime transportation networks have become an indispensable element of logistics networks. Approximately 80% of the global trade volume is transported by sea with the maritime logistics network fueling global economic integration. Due to the uncertainty of the transportation process and the impact of accidents, the reliability analysis of the logistics network is a topic of immense interest. In this paper, we propose an original and novel model to quantitatively analyze the vulnerability of the maritime logistics network by considering the importance of each port in the network. Three centrality measures that consider different topology information of the network are used in this paper to identify the importance of ports. Different information about the network is considered through the joint entropy and the multiscale factor  to evaluate the vulnerability of the logistics network. The Asia–Europe maritime transportation network serves as a real-world example to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed model. The experimental results suggest that the performance of the maritime network is closely related to the heterogeneity of the connectivity pattern and the process of decentralization can reduce the vulnerability of the maritime network.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.; Cox, F.; Sands, C. J.; Garnett, M. H.; Magan, N.; Horrocks, C. A.; Dungait, J. A. J.; Robinson, C.","1 Dec 2020","We report a previously undescribed member of the Helotiales that is superabundant in soils at two maritime Antarctic islands under Antarctic Hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica Desv.). High throughput sequencing showed that up to 92% of DNA reads, and 68% of RNA reads, in soils from the islands were accounted for by the fungus. Sequencing of the large subunit region of ribosomal (r)DNA places the fungus close to the Pezizellaceae, Porodiplodiaceae, and Sclerotiniaceae, with analyses of internal transcribed spacer regions of rDNA indicating that it has affinities to previously unnamed soil and root fungi from alpine, cool temperate and Low Arctic regions. The fungus was found to be most frequent in soils containing C aged to 1,000–1,200 years before present. The relative abundances of its DNA and RNA reads were positively associated with soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations and δ13C values, with the relative abundance of its DNA being negatively associated with soil pH value. An isolate of the fungus produces flask-shaped phialides with a pronounced venter bearing masses of conidia measuring 4.5–6(7) × 1.8–2.5 μm, suggestive of anamorphic Chalara. Enzymatic studies indicate that the isolate strongly synthesizes the extracellular enzyme acid phosphatase, and also exhibits alkaline phosphatase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase activities. Ecophysiological measurements indicate optimal hyphal growth of the isolate at a pH of 4.2–4.5 and a water potential of −0.66 MPa. The isolate is a psychrotroph, exhibiting measureable hyphal growth at −2°C, optimal hyphal extension rate at 15°C and negligible growth at 25°C. It is proposed that the rising temperatures that are predicted to occur in maritime Antarctica later this century will increase the growth rate of the fungus, with the potential loss of ancient C from soils. Analyses using the GlobalFungi Database indicate that the fungus is present in cold, acidic soils on all continents. We advocate further studies to identify whether it is superabundant in soils under D. antarctica elsewhere in maritime Antarctica, and for further isolates to be obtained so that the species can be formally described.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

We find that negative money supply shocks caused Spanish real output to decline. A transmission channel analysis highlights slow price adjustments and credit frictions as channels through which money supply changes affected the real economy. Especially large output declines occurred in textile manufacturing against the backdrop of a credit crunch that impaired merchants’ ability to supply their manufacturers with inputs.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Divisions at sea: Class, gender, race, and nation in maritime films of the Second World War, 1939-60","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/divisions-at-sea-class-gender-race-and-nation-in-maritime-films-o","Summerfield, P.","Sep 2011","The configuration of the war at sea in the popular memory of the Second World War has been relatively neglected. In particular, historians have overlooked the division between the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. Yet portrayals of the two navies differed widely. Maritime films both during and after the war followed a well-established tradition of representing the navy as a force of disciplined and respectable men led by gentlemen heroes that reliably defended nation and empire. Such representations rarely acknowledged the existence of the Merchant Navy with its globally recruited and racially mixed workforce and its troubling associations with indiscipline. Yet naval operations largely concerned its protection, and the British war effort depended on the goods it transported. In the context of the leftward drift of wartime politics, the Merchant Navy received rare attention in a 1943 film that nevertheless avoided depicting non-white merchant seaman or disturbing the gender division. After the war the focus of maritime films returned to the Royal Navy. The liminal presence of the Merchant Navy in films of the 1950s was, however, significant. It was, variously, the vector for the expression of British insecurities about the wartime victory, the occasion for the portrayal of the enemy as an honourable foe, and a means to both romanticize, and hint at the fragility of, imperial masculinity. © The Author [2011].

Shifts in ownership from the state to private hands or pious foundations put further stress on the state’s traditional fiscal base. Christ argues that the sultans increased taxation and state intervention in response, and thus that control of the international transit trade turned out to be particularly profitable. In order to tap it more effectively, the Mamluk sultanate reinforced ties with the Venetians in the Mediterranean and the Rasulids in the Red Sea. Relations were grounded in an ambiguous language of gift exchange which allowed for the harmonization of nominal hierarchical difference and de facto bilateral, symbiotic exchange. On the basis of shared trade interests, the Mamluks delegated power over the ‘Two Seas’. This delegation was not perfect though; the Mamluks also sought to establish a direct if only seasonal fiscal presence in the Egyptian gateways of this trade in Alexandria, Upper Egypt and the Hijaz , thus combining delegation on the seas with tighter control in the ports in order to channel the lucrative transit trade through their Cairo power base.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The objective is to ensure continuity of operation at all sites by maintaining adequate inventory levels of all raw materials. We develop a novel multi-grid continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation based (Susarla, Li, & Karimi, 2010) for this chemical logistics problem. Our model allows limited jetties at each site, non-zero transfer times, variable load/unload quantities, transfer task sequencing, etc. In contrast to the literature, it needs no separate estimates for arrivals at each site. Several examples are solved to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed formulation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Instead, a range of ascomycete fungi, termed dark septate endophytes (DSEs), frequently colonise the roots of these plant species. We demonstrate that colonisation of Antarctic vascular plants by DSEs facilitates not only the acquisition of organic nitrogen as early protein breakdown products, but also as non-proteinaceous D-amino acids and their short peptides, accumulated in slowly-decomposing organic matter, such as moss peat. Our findings suggest that, in a warming maritime Antarctic, this symbiosis has a key role in accelerating the replacement of formerly dominant moss communities by vascular plants, and in increasing the rate at which ancient carbon stores laid down as moss peat over centuries or millennia are returned to the atmosphere as CO2.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Our results display close agreement with available experimental and LES data other than the results of Thom (1934). We conclude that the addition of discs by the latter led, at the relatively low Reynolds numbers of his experiments, to the boundary layer on the cylinder being thinned to a point at which the boundary layers became laminar or transitional, thus leading to higher lift coefficients than pertain in turbulent flow. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This was made possible through use of a holographic instrument able to image cloud particles at very high resolution and small size (6 μm). The environment in which the observations were conducted was notable for the presence of desert dust advected over the ocean from the Sahara. However, there is no laboratory evidence to suggest that these dust particles can act as ice nuclei at temperatures warmer than about −10 ◦ C, the zone in which the first ice was observed in these clouds. The small ice particles were observed to grow rapidly by vapour diffusion, riming, and possibly through collisions with supercooled raindrops, causing these to freeze and potentially shatter. This in turn leads to the further production of secondary ice in these clouds. Hence, although the numbers of primary ice particles are small, they are very effective in initiating the rapid glaciation of the cloud, altering the dynamics and precipitation produc- tion processes.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Organic aerosol above a tropical rainforest located in Danum Valley, Borneo, Malaysia, a high isoprene emission region, was studied during Summer 2008 using Aerosol Mass Spectrometry and offline detailed characterisation using comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography. Observations indicate that a substantial fraction (up to 15% by mass) of atmospheric sub-micron organic aerosol was observed as methylfuran (MF) after thermal desorption. This observation was associated with the simultaneous measurements of established gas-phase isoprene oxidation products methylvinylketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR). Observations of MF were also made during experimental chamber oxidation of isoprene. Positive matrix factorisation of the AMS organic mass spectral time series produced a robust factor which accounts for an average of 23% (0.18μgm-3), reaching as much as 53% (0.50 μgm-3) of the total oraganic loading, identified by (and highly correlated with) a strong MF signal. Assuming that this factor is generally representative of isoprene SOA, isoprene derived aerosol plays a significant role in the region. Comparisons with measurements from other studies suggest this type of isoprene SOA plays a role in other isoprene dominated environments, albeit with varying significance. © 2011 Author(s).","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Q.; Ma, F.; Chen, Y. W.; Wang, J.","24 Dec 2019","Ferries are usually used for transporting passengers and vehicles among docks, and any deviation of the course can lead to serious consequences. Therefore, transportation ferries must be watched closely by local maritime administrators, which involves much manpower. With the use of historical data, this article proposes an intelligent method of integrating artificial potential field with Bayesian Network to trigger deviation warnings for a ferry based on its trajectory, speed and course. More specifically, a repulsive potential field-based model is first established to capture a customary waterway of ferries. Subsequently, a method based on non-linear optimisation is introduced to train the coefficients of the proposed repulsive potential field. The deviation of a ferry from the customary route can then be quantified by the potential field. Bayesian Network is further introduced to trigger deviation warnings in accordance with the distribution of deviation values, speeds and courses. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by the historical data of a chosen ferry on a specific route. The testing results show that the approach is capable of providing deviation warnings for ferries accurately and can offer a practical solution for maritime supervision.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

M.; Mingham, C. G.; McLean, D. A.; Bandar, Z. A.","Sep 2005","Overtopping of seawalls presents a considerable hazard to people and property near the coast and accurate predictions of overtopping volumes are essential in informing seawall construction. The methods most commonly used for the prediction of time-averaged overtopping volumes are parametric regression and numerical modelling. In this paper overtopping volumes are predicted using artificial neural networks. This approach is inherently non-parametric and accepts data from a variety of structural configurations and sea-states. Two different types of neural network are considered: multi-layer perceptron networks and radial basis function networks. It was found that the radial basis function networks considerably outperform both the multi-layer perceptron networks and the curve-fitting (parametric regression) regime, and approach bespoke numerical simulations in accuracy. Unlike numerical simulation, the neural network approach gives generic prediction across a range of structures and sea-states and therefore incurs considerably less computational cost.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Whether trading wool across the Channel to Europe, seeking spices in South Asia or importing sugar from the Caribbean, shipping was an essential resource. Yet, to undertake these trades, merchants required naval supplies – finished ships, timber to build them and stores to fill them – that were not always easily accessible. This challenge was particularly apparent in the early seventeenth century for trading corporations whose specific needs demanded innovative approaches to the naval supply problem. This article examines the responses of English corporations to the challenge of supplying its international shipping by focusing on activities on each side of the Atlantic. First, it assesses the development of the East India Company’s docks at Blackwall and Dundaniel, before turning to a detailed study of ship-building and supply in Virginia and New England. In doing so, this article highlights the importance of naval supply to Britain’s north Atlantic empire, both in terms of the rhetorical support for empire and the economic incentives of participants. This reveals how traditional interpretations of Britain’s naval development have too often focused on state-driven activities (particularly from the very end of the seventeenth century) and failed to examine the complex, sometimes chaotic attempts by private individuals and corporations to overcome the naval supply challenges common to this early period of globalisation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.","Sep 2006","A validated one-dimensional Boussinesq-non-linear shallow water equations numerical model was used to investigate the interaction of solitary waves with beaches. The numerical model requires two adjustable parameters: the bed friction coefficient and a wave breaking parameter. Excellent agreement was achieved between the numerical predictions of solitary wave transformation and run-up at a plane beach with two sets of high-quality laboratory measurements: one a large number of experiments in a wave flume by Synolakis, the other in the UK Coastal Research Facility. A parameter study investigated the effect of uniform offshore water depth, bed friction and bed slope on solitary wave run-up. A uniform water depth may be associated with a continental shelf region. The non-dimensional run-up was found to be an asymptotic function of non-dimensional wave amplitude at high and low values of initial wave steepness. Both asymptotes scale as (R/ho) ∼ α(Ao/h o)β where R is run-up (defined as the vertical elevation reached by the wave uprush above still water level), Ao is the offshore wave amplitude and ho is the uniform depth offshore of the beach. The empirical coefficients α and β depend on the beach characteristics. The model is then used to simulate the interaction of a full-scale tsunami event with an idealised beach profile representative of a beach in Eastern Kamchatka.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Furthermore, evidence collected through a survey instrument addressed to shipping companies located in Greece suggests that the choice of MCS is contingent upon the strategy pursued by the shipping companies. Moreover, this paper tests whether shipping companies with an optimal fit between their strategies and their MCS experience superior business performance and a higher perceived usefulness of MCS.

This article argues that it is therefore unsurprising that the sea also impacted on copper workers in the southern Aegean during the Early Bronze Age. Here, the sea was an integral element of the copper production, which is characterized by movement of metal across the sea from one manufacturing stage to the next—often over considerable distances requiring lengthy absences of the workers from their home communities, making metalworkers true maritime specialists alongside the more “typical” traders, fishermen, and seafarers. The distances traveled magnified the symbolic value of the raw materials as the object’s geographic distance became converted into a symbolic value-added “exotic” distance. This value was further enhanced thanks to the mastery of skills required to traverse the sea, an element very different from land and intimately associated with forgetting, disposal, and death.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

By drawing together evidence of consumption of marine animals, seafaring, fishing, and iconography, this article unites disparate strands of evidence in an attempt to illuminate the relationship prehistoric Greeks had with marine creatures and the sea. Based on the marked reduction in seafood consumption after the Mesolithic and the use of marine creatures in funerary iconography in the post-palatial period, it becomes apparent that the sea-then as now-is an inherently ambiguous medium that captures both positive and negative emotions. On the one hand, the sea and the animals residing in it are strongly associated with death. On the other hand, the sea's positive dimensions, such as fertility and rebirth, are expressed in conspicuous marine consumption events. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.","4 Dec 2017","This research addresses the sustainability and safety related challenges associated with the complex, practical, and real-time maritime transportation problem, and proposes a multiobjective mathematical model integrating different shipping operations. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is formulated considering different maritime operations, such as routing and scheduling of ships, time window concept considering port's high tidal scenario, discrete planning horizon, loading/unloading operation, carbon emission from the vessel, and ship's draft restriction for maintaining the vessel's safety at the port. The relationship between fuel consumption and vessel speed optimization is included in the model for the estimation of the total fuel consumed and carbon emission from each vessel. Time window concept considered in the problem aims to improve the service level of the port by imposing different penalty charges associated with the early arrival of the vessel before the starting of the time window and vessel failing to finish its operation within the allotted time window. Another practical aspect of the maritime transportation such as high tide scenario is included in the model to depict the vessel arrival and departure time at a port. Two novel algorithms-Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Multiobjective particle swarm optimization have been applied to solve the multiobjective mathematical model. The illustrative examples inspired from the real-life problems of an international shipping company are considered for application. The experimental results, comparative, and sensitivity analysis demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

It has the aim oflocating fuel debris. The AVEXIS submersible vehicle used in this study has been designed as a low-cost, potentially disposable, inspection platform that is the smallest of its class and is capable of being deployed through a 150 mm diameter access pipe. To map the gamma-ray environment, a cerium bromide scintillator detector with a small form factor has been incorporated into the AVEXIS to identify radioactive isotopes via gamma-ray spectroscopy. This provides the combined system with the potential to map gamma-ray spectra and particle locations throughout submerged, contaminated facilities, such as Units 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The hypothesis of this research is to determine the sensitivity of the combined system in a submerged environment that replicates the combination of gamma radiation and water submersion but at lower dose rates.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Mixed radiation fields of this type can arise in the context of reactor accidents via, for example, 137Cs (gamma) and 244Cm (neutrons). However, performance degradation of such scintillators, such as EJ-301, is a significant possibility that might limit the use of this technology in accident response applications. The premise behind the high dose rate testing of such a liquid scintillator described in this paper is for fuel debris characterisation at Fukushima Daiichi, which has expected dose rates of up to 1000 Gy/hr in close proximity to fuel debris. The tests carried out for this investigation involved using the 60Co gamma irradiation facility at the Dalton Cumbria Facility, Cumbria, United Kingdom to expose the detector to a similar dose rate to that which is estimated within the primary containment vessel for survivability tests. Radiation hardness tests have rarely been reported for such devices and it is expected that the performance will be dependent on the survival of the window of the photomultiplier tube rather than the liquid scintillant itself. A major advantage of the use of this detector is its physical size, due to the limitations on access into Fukushima reactors physical space is a premium. The research described in this paper presents the results of the dose rate exposure of the detector before signal was lost with the total dose observed providing information on any degradation affecting the performance of the device post-irradiation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The complexity of the global shipping system makes predicting volumes and patterns of long-term future international maritime trade a challenging task which is best explored by building scenarios rather than ‘precise’ forecasts. We present four contrasting scenarios of international maritime trade out to 2050, available in high resolution in terms of the dimensions studied (regions, countries, commodities, decades), which are consistent with high and low levels of global CO2 mitigation and associated climate impacts. The scenarios project trade increasing to between two and four times the 2010 value by 2050. Scenarios characterised by low temperature increases and material intensity lead to the lower bound trade increase with high trade growth in bioenergy commodities. Unfettered production growth across countries, high temperature increases and material intensity lead to a quadrupling of trade across energy, containerised, dry and wet commodities. The estimated range is lower than those in existing scenarios and forecasts in which globalisation is assumed to continue apace. The scenarios which project the highest growth presupposes both limited decarbonisation (in contrast to the Paris Agreement) and continued growth in expanding markets. The scenarios therefore become a valuable policy and decision-making tool to address technological and operational change required of the shipping sector, if it is to deliver mitigation in line with the Paris Agreement.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The precise location of the debris is not known, for example as to whether it remains within the reactor pressure vessel or it has leaked through into the base of the pedestal below. Additionally, the state of the fuel is also in question as to whether this has evolved from within its cladding or if it is intact. The most likely scenario is a combination of all four of these situations. The flooding of the reactor floors immediately following the Fukushima accident adds an extra element of complexity for the detection system, for example requiring it to be submersible and to hold any detector system in water-tight confinement. The research carried out has involved extensive modifications to a previously-designed, low-cost, small-scale AVEXIS submersible inspection vehicle and the incorporation of a variety of radiation detectors. The latter has been designed to allow for mapping and determination of the situation that is present within the primary containment vessels. The challenges addressed with the detection system arise from the high dose rates that have been recorded around the reactor pressure vessels which can be as high as 1000 Gy/hr. In such a harsh environment not only will the radiation detectors struggle to operate but the components that make up the remote-operated vehicle are also likely to suffer radiation damage after only a relatively short period of time. The research presented here evaluates the components comprising the AVEXIS system in terms of their radiation tolerability as well as presenting the combination of detectors to be used in the remote probe for the investigation of the fuel debris.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This article assesses the risk levels of bearing and gearbox, which are the most sensitive components of the ship crane using fuzzy rule–based judgement for common elements and their sources. This will provide the ship crane operators with a means to predict possible impending failure without having to dismantle the crane. Furthermore, to monitor the rate of wear in gearbox and bearing of a ship crane, the ship crane reliability, and a trend to provide an operational baseline of data that will help the engineers to detect abnormal wear rates as they develop, is established. Within the scope of this research, a risk assessment model is developed for determining the risk levels of a crane’s components and recommending solutions using all the diagnostic capability obtainable for effective condition monitoring of the gearbox and bearing in ship cranes.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

As such, refugees are now crossing waters that have become extended sovereign borders. This is manifest in increased maritime surveillance to prevent refugees arriving by boat and landing on Europe’s and Australia’s shores. In this context, materially and symbolically, lighthouses mark out the space between the sea and land and in so doing, delimit these territorial and maritime borders. Although the function of the lighthouse is to warn those at sea of the dangers on the coastline, steering them away from coastal hazards and guiding them through a safe passage, for many sea travellers it can also represent the safety of the land, of arrival. This paper explores the ambiguous roles and effects of lighthouses; uniquely placed as sentinel posts along the coast they can aid military surveillance and control while at the same time enabling humanitarian assistance. It explores these conflicting functions focusing on how the lighthouse, as a border between land and sea, simultaneously protects and excludes offering beacons of hope as well as signalling danger. The paper draws on the arrival of refugees at Korakas lighthouse on the Greek island of Lesvos to illuminate these variable functions.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Emphasis is placed on characterizing ice particle shapes in Tropical Maritime and Mid‐Latitude Continental anvil cirrus, as well as in cirrus formed in situ in the upper troposphere, and subvisible cirrus in the upper tropical troposphere layer. There is a distinctive difference in cirrus ice particle shapes formed in situ compared to those in anvils that are generated in close proximity to convection. More than half the mass in cirrus formed in situ are rosette‐shapes (polycrystals and bullet rosettes). Cirrus formed from fresh convective anvils is mostly devoid of rosette‐shaped particles. However, small frozen drops may experience regrowth downwind of an aged anvil in a regime with RHice > ~ 120%, and then grow into rosette shapes. Identifiable particle shapes in Tropical Maritime anvils that have not been impacted by continental influences typically contain mostly single plate‐like and columnar crystals and aggregates. Mid‐Latitude Continental anvils contain single rimed particles, more and larger aggregates with riming, and chains of small ice particles when in a highly electrified environment. The particles in subvisible cirrus are < ~ 100 μm and quasi‐spherical with some plates and rare trigonal shapes. Percentages of particle shapes and power laws relating mean particle area and mass to dimension are provided to improve parameterization of remote retrievals and numerical simulations.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

In doing so, we scrutinize how notions of urban resilience, climate adaptation, and ecosystem-based infrastructure are influencing contemporary planning practice. Our account from New Orleans and the Mississippi River Delta traces several large-scale hydrological engineering projects with origins in the early 20th century, which aimed to restructure the landscape for more effective maritime transportation, flood protection, and urban drainage. The account then turns to a discussion of a massive and ongoing planning project, which aims to restore the historical dynamics of the Mississippi River Delta, diverting the river into nearby coastal wetlands to provide storm protection for vulnerable communities, most especially New Orleans. Our analysis shows how the development of water infrastructure systems in the region produced cleavages in the region's body politic and eco-hydrology, generating disputes that threaten to slow or obstruct the plan's implementation. The study shows how the forms and discourses of political contention in the present are deeply informed by past decisions regarding the placement, operation, and maintenance of water infrastructures in the region. The conflicts that emerge from these cleavages comprise the primary obstacle facing ecosystem-based strategies aimed at securing New Orleans and other major settlements in the region from storm surges. This raises fundamental challenges for planning practice, which are explored here through a discussion of situational dissensus, conflicting rationalities, and pathways for democratic institutional innovation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K. R.; Gunasekaran, A.; Subramanian, N.; Tiwari, M. K.","8 Apr 2016","Ship routing and scheduling problem is considered to meet the demand for various products in multiple ports within the planning horizon. The ports have restricted operating time, so multiple time windows are taken into account. The problem addresses the operational measures such as speed optimisation and slow steaming for reducing carbon emission. A Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model is presented and it includes the issues pertaining to multiple time horizons, sustainability aspects and varying demand and supply at various ports. The formulation incorporates several real time constraints addressing the multiple time window, varying supply and demand, carbon emission, etc. that conceive a way to represent several complicating scenarios experienced in maritime transportation. Owing to the inherent complexity, such a problem is considered to be NP-Hard in nature and for solutions an effective meta-heuristics named Particle Swarm Optimization-Composite Particle (PSO-CP) is employed. Results obtained from PSO-CP are compared using PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and GA (Genetic Algorithm) to prove its superiority. Addition of sustainability constraints leads to a 4-10% variation in the total cost. Results suggest that the carbon emission, fuel cost and fuel consumption constraints can be comfortably added to the mathematical model for encapsulating the sustainability dimensions.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

J.","2005","A survey of available mass-balance data shows that glaciers on arctic islands, i.e. mountain glaciers and ice caps in northern Canada, Greenland, Svalbard and the Eurasian islands, share mass-balance characteristics of low annual amplitude and small interannual variability. By contrast, glaciers around the Arctic (e.g. in Alaska, Iceland, mainland Scandinavia and northern Eurasia) can have exceptionally large annual amplitude and interannual variability but otherwise share characteristics with glaciers in lower latitudes. The arctic island glaciers occur in areas with low annual precipitation and high annual temperature variability, i.e. in dry-cold or continental regions. Most glaciers surrounding the Arctic (Alaska, Iceland and Scandinavia) occur in areas with high annual precipitation and low annual temperature variability, i.e. in wet-warm or maritime regions. Earlier mass-balance modelling showed that arctic island glaciers have low sensitivity to temperature changes consistent with their low mass-balance amplitude. However, very large changes in mass balance could occur on arctic island glaciers if the sea ice surrounding the arctic islands were reduced so that the climate of the arctic islands becomes more maritime.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

W.; Farrar, J.; Roberts, P.; Farrell, M.; Grant, H.; Newsham, K. K.; Hopkins, D. W.; Bardgett, R. D.; Jones, D. L.","Apr 2011","For the past 50 years there has been rapid warming in the maritime Antarctic, with concurrent, and probably temperature-mediated, proliferation of the two native plants, Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) and especially Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica). In many terrestrial ecosystems at high latitudes, nitrogen (N) supply regulates primary productivity. Although the predominant view is that only inorganic and amino acid N are important sources of N for angiosperms, most N enters soil as protein. Maritime Antarctic soils have large stocks of proteinaceous N, which is released slowly as decomposition is limited by low temperatures. Consequently, an ability to acquire N at an early stage of availability is key to the success of photosynthetic organisms. Here we show that D. antarctica can acquire N through its roots as short peptides, produced at an early stage of protein decomposition, acquiring N over three times faster than as amino acid, nitrate or ammonium, and more than 160 times faster than the mosses with which it competes. Efficient acquisition of the N released in faster decomposition of soil organic matter as temperatures rise may give D. antarctica an advantage over competing mosses that has facilitated its recent proliferation in the maritime Antarctic. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This characteristic results in the appearance of fault specific frequencies in the machine stator current spectrum for a well defined subset of CRIMs. The identified fault specific frequencies may be used for the unambiguous detection of stator failures.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Because the poor suffer the most from that crisis, diakonia, which considers looking after the poor as one of its concerns, can play a critical role. However, instead of focusing exclusively on human interest, this article seeks to conceptualise diakonia as a ministry that has concerns for all creatures whose lives rely on the sea, and the sea itself. I begin with integrating the marine ecological crisis into diakonia by engaging with theological discourses on diakonia to suggest that such an integration is plausible and necessary. This integration leads to a discussion on the emerging discourse of eco-diakonia to argue that the sea should be a recipient of diakonia. Then, based on the encounter between a Christian theology of diakonia and traditional maritime cultures of Indonesia navigated by a Trinitarian pneumatology of creation, I proceed further to argue that the sea should also be perceived as diakonos. These arguments constitute the concept of ‘blue diakonia’: a ministry that acknowledges and supports the sea as an active participant in the Trinitarian Spirit’s work by feeding the poor and giving life to all creatures.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The rapid overseas expansion of European nations began with the maritime centre which Henry the Navigator established at Sagras in Portugal. Four centuries later other searchers after new areas of exploitation-Nasmyth, Bessemer, Stephenson-had immense effect on the growth of the new steam-powered industries and dependent businesses. And so it has gone on ever since-to the development of the new transistor in the Bell Laboratories in 1947, to Alistair Pilkington's invention of float glass in 1952 and beyond. As Denis Loveridge shows in this article, these and many similar revolutionary inventions depend on personal endurance for their successful completion, while their widespread adoption has repercussions over many decades, making it imperative for industries to look ahead. Foresight in this context needs to adopt a wider view than simply that of technological optimism; what is needed is business built on the philosophy of wisdom, on the concept of value, which embraces the wider issues of business and creates achievable visions for its future. © 1988.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This would be achieved by seeding, with copious quantities of seawater cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), low‐level maritime stratocumulus clouds covering these regions or those at the source of incoming currents. Higher cloud droplet density would increase these clouds' reflectivity to incoming sunlight, and possibly their longevity. This approach is therefore a more localized application of the marine cloud brightening (MCB) geoengineering technique promoting global cooling. By utilizing a climate ocean/atmosphere coupled model, HadGEM1, we demonstrate that—subject to the satisfactory resolution of defined but unresolved issues—judicious seeding of maritime stratocumulus clouds might significantly reduce sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in regions where hurricanes develop. Thus artificial seeding may reduce hurricane intensity; but how well the magnitude of this effect could be controlled is yet to be determined.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.","9 Jul 2019","This paper endeavors to explore the sustainable container shipping problem considering fuel bunker management and provide adequate recovery policies for countering disruption within maritime transportation. This paper addresses the environmental concerns related to fuel consumption and carbon emission within shipping operations and simultaneously presents strategies for countering disruption within the maritime transportation domain. Several studies addressed bunker fuel management strategies, but overlooked the need for integrating it with shipping operations. This paper aims to bridge this research gap by proposing a novel mathematical model and presenting a heuristic procedure combined with a variable neighborhood search algorithm for maximizing the shipping company's profitability, while addressing the vessel routing and scheduling decisions, container loading and unloading operations, selection of bunkering ports, and determining bunkered amount for heavy fuel oil and marine diesel oil. Recovery strategies such as port swapping and rescheduling of vessel route are considered to deal with disruptions related to weather adversities. An illustrative example is presented depicting the realistic scenario and providing results associated with ship routes, vessel speed, bunkering ports, bunkered amounts, fuel consumed by the vessel on each sailing leg, arrival and departure time of the ships, etc. Insights obtained from the analysis performed based on the fuel price, ship's bunkering capacity, adverse weather conditions on various routes, port closure, carbon tax, and fuel consumption provide useful information for shipping company managers. Managerial implications are presented with regard to the impact of fuel prices and carbon tax on shipping operation from the perspective of overall operational cost. Moreover, the results provide important policy insights for shipping company managers in terms of possessing alternate vessel route options for normal scenario and disrupted scenarios including weather adversities on sailing leg or port closure.

The results suggest strongly that a simple relationship exists between droplet effective radius and liquid water content in layer clouds with the droplet effective radius proportional to the cube root of the liquid water content. The constant of proportionality is different over oceans and continents. In current global climate models liquid water content is not a predicted variable in convective clouds, and the data strongly suggest that a fixed value of droplet effective radius between 9 and 10 mum should be used for continental clouds more than 500 m deep and 16 mum for maritime cumulus more than 1.5 km deep.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

We measured the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), amino acids and inorganic N in soils under these two vascular plant species, and under mosses and lichens, over a growing season at Signy Island in the maritime Antarctic. We recorded higher concentrations of nitrate, total dissolved nitrogen, DOC, DON and free amino acids in soil under D. antarctica and C. quitensis than in lichen or moss dominated soils. Each vegetation cover gave a unique profile of individual free amino acids in soil solution. Significant interactions between soil type and time were found for free amino acid concentrations and C/N ratios, indicating that vascular plants significantly change the temporal dynamics of N mineralization and immobilization. We conclude that D. antarctica and C. quitensis exert a significant influence over C and N cycling in the maritime Antarctic, and that their recent population expansion will have led to significant changes in the amount, type and rate of organic C and N cycling in soil. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

L.","Jul 2018","Ice volume during the last ten 100 ka glacial cycles was driven by solar radiation flux in the northern hemisphere. Early minima in solar radiation combined with critical levels of atmospheric CO2 drove initial glacier expansion. Glacial cycles between MIS 24-13, whilst at 100 ka periodicity, were irregular in amplitude and the shift to the largest amplitude 100 ka glacial cycles occurs after MIS 16. Mountain glaciers in the mid-latitudes and Asia reached their maximum extents early in glacial cycles then retreated as global climate became increasingly arid. In contrast, larger ice masses close to maritime moisture sources continued to build-up and dominated global glacial maxima reflected in marine isotope and sea-level records. The effect of this pattern of glaciation on the state of the global atmosphere is evident in dust records from Antarctic ice cores where pronounced double peaks in dust flux occur in all of the last eight glacial cycles. Glacier growth is strongly modulated by variations in solar radiation, especially in glacial inceptions. This external control accounts for ~50-60% of ice volume change through glacial cycles. Internal global glacier-climate dynamics account for the rest of the change which is controlled by the geographical distributions of glaciers. ","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Using original scenarios, this paper demonstrates for the first time that it is possible for a nation's shipping to make a fair contribution to meeting global climate change commitments, but that this requires transformation of the sector. The scale and nature of technology change varies depending on the level of demand and how this is satisfied. The scenarios show that to develop successful marine mitigation policy, it is essential to consider the interdependencies between ship speed, level and pattern of demand for services, and the extent and rate of innovation in propulsion technology. Across the scenarios, it is difficult to foresee how deep decarbonisation can be achieved without an immediate, fleet-wide speed reduction; and a land-based energy-system transition strongly influences shipping demand, which in turn, influences the extent of required low-carbon propulsion technology change. Setting the industry on a 2 °C heading requires multifaceted and near-term changes in the shipping sector, but these are unlikely to materialise without a major shift by stakeholders to realise new and innovative deep decarbonisation policies in the coming decade.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The δ13C values are typical of carbonates precipitating in an open lake system with the exception of samples from the very uppermost parts of these sequences which have values more typical of palustrine or tufaceous carbonates and, therefore, indicate the progressive contraction and shrinkage of the lake system overtime. The δ18O values record an initial increase to an early peak at the onset of the Holocene but a subsequent decline in values of such a magnitude that by ca 8000 yrs B.P. the δ18O value of the precipitated carbonate is consistent with carbonates that precipitated at the end of the Loch Lomond Stadial. The early increase and peak in δ18O values is suggested to reflect the climatic amelioration at the onset of the Holocene, as temperatures progressively rose. The decline cannot be explained by any known temperature shifts, however, this “depletion trend” is seen in several other early Holocene lacustrine records from across the British Isles. This decline is suggested to reflect a shift in the seasonality of precipitation from a more seasonal precipitation regime typical of a “continental” climate, with strong seasonal contrasts in rainfall, to a more “maritime” climate which was characterised by consistent levels of rainfall occurring across the year. The relative timing of human activity at Star Carr suggests human occupation occurred after this isotopic decline under “maritime” rather than “continental” climates.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This involves estimating the temperature sensitivity of glacier mass balance for grid squares containing glaciers, multiplying by the appropriate glacier area, and summing over all grid squares with glacier cover, excluding Greenland and Antarctica. The temperature sensitivity of mass balance for each grid square is calculated from precipitation in a gridded climatology using a relationship based on degree day modelling for 61 individual glaciers. Smaller mass balance sensitivities occur for dry cold (continental) glaciers and larger sensitivities for warm-wet (maritime) glaciers. The globally averaged mass balance sensitivity is -0.41 m a-1 deg-1 in good agreement with the value found earlier by J. Oerlemans. The global sea level sensitivity is 0.62 to 0.81 mm a 1 deg 1, depending on which value is used for global glacier area. Regional contributions to sea level sensitivity agree quite well with earlier values found by M. F. Meier in 1984 and J. Oerlemans in 1993.

"A Generalized Belief Entropy With Nonspecificity and Structural Conflict","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/a-generalized-belief-entropy-with-nonspecificity-and-structural-c","Zhou, M.; Zhu, S-S.; Chen, Y-W.; Wu, J.; Herrera-Viedma, E.","2 Dec 2021","The Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory has been widely used in many fields from probabilistic inference, information fusion to decision analysis due to its superiority to formulate uncertain and incomplete information under a weaker condition than the Bayesian probability theory. To support the elicitation of basic probability assignment (BPA), numerous uncertainty measures have been proposed in the recent decades, which take into account nonspecificity and structural conflict (SC) in either the entropy-alike or nonentropy form. This article is focused primarily on developing a generalized belief entropy to measure and quantify the uncertainty of BPA in a consistent and comprehensive way. The definition of the proposed belief entropy involves three components. Specifically, the first component is Shannon's definition of entropy of probability functions which can be interpreted as the measure of discord of the mass function among various focal elements. The second component is the measure of total nonspecificity which is the generalization of Dubois-Prade's definition of nonspecificity measure. Furthermore, the critical component introduced in this article is the utilization of the SC coefficient within an evidence, which fully considers the intersection between each pair of focal elements of the BPA. The characteristics and properties of the new generalized belief entropy are analyzed systematically with theoretical proofs. Finally, the proposed belief entropy is embedded to a three-tuple approach to deal with a practical multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problem to demonstrate its validity and strengths of measuring nonspecificity and SC in uncertain decision making.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

J.; Heymsfield, A. J.; Choularton, T. W.","Oct 2006","A modelling study is presented to look at the potential importance of ice multiplication in a deep Cb cloud observed during the second Egrett Microphysics Experiment with Radiation, Lidar and Dynamics (EMERALD-II). Simulations with both a cloud-resolving model (CRM) and an explicit-microphysics model (EMM) are used. The CRM has a two-moment bulk microphysics scheme and resolved cloud dynamics, while the EMM has detailed size-resolved microphysics, but is driven by the CRM cloud dynamics. The simulations consider the sensitivity of the storms to the rime-splinter, secondary ice production mechanism (or Hallett-Mossop process). Recent literature on modelling this process in Cb clouds suggests that it is of low importance to the cloud glaciation in intense storms. However, until now, numerical simulations in the literature have investigated this process by either switching it on or off in the model microphysics scheme. We show that if the rate of splinter production is doubled from that proposed by Hallett and Mossop's experiment - a reasonable factor - then for this simulated model cloud, there is a large direct impact on anvil glaciation. The approximate net radiative impact of this calculated with the CRM is 10Wm-2. Similar, 'nonlinear' results can also be expected from other ice nucleating mechanisms. Simulations are performed for both continental and maritime cloud condensation nuclei concentrations. In stark contrast to previous literature, we find that the Hallett-Mossop process is more important in the continental ('polluted') case than in the maritime ('clean') case. This is because of the extremely warm cloud base for this particular storm and consequently - because of the rapid production of rain - the scarcity of small cloud droplets for riming in the clean case. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2006.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Avoiding dangerous climate change: the role of shipping in delivering on the IPCC’s latest carbon budgets","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/avoiding-dangerous-climate-change-the-role-of-shipping-in-deliver","Bows-Larkin, A.; Traut, M.; Anderson, K.","Jul 2015","In 2015 and with global emissions rising at unprecedented rates one clear certainty is that the future will be very different from the past. Whether the world continues to follow a trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions exceeding those in RCP8.5, the highest in the IPCC’s suite of scenarios and associated with an expected temperature increase of between and 3°C and 5°C, or whether we begin a programme of stringent mitigation, is a decision for the international community. These two paths lead to very different futures, each radically different from the past. This paper reflects on and analyses the role of the global shipping industry as an important player in both these potential futures.The Kyoto Protocol has called on the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to “... [control greenhouse gas emissions from shipping]”. In 2009, the then secretary general of the IMO concluded that “our collective way of life has become unsustainable” and stressed “the need to make some tough decisions ... and ... to start putting life ahead of lifestyle”. In contrast, the baseline suite of six shipping emissions scenarios in the 2nd IMO GHG Study (2009) has CO2 emissions between 2007 and 2050 rise by a factor of between 2.2 and 3.1. Similarly, the 3rd IMO GHG Study (2014) presents a suite of sixteen scenarios, with rises of up to 3.5 times those estimated for 2012.It is important to that the updated emissions estimates in the 3rd IMO GHG Study (2014) demonstrate a fall in CO2 over the period 2007 to 2012. It argues that much of this emission reduction was due to slow steaming in response to a global economic downturn. Recent emissions reductions may, therefore, represent ‘latent CO2’, that could be realised once the economic situation changes and vessels revert to pre-crisis speeds.The paper contrasts the different emissions pathways for the shipping sector, placing them in the quantitative context of global emissions scenarios and associated temperature responses. It concludes that steering a mitigation course has never been more critical, nor the choice more stark.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

How to cope with consistency and consensus under uncertain circumstance are two critical issues in pairwise comparison based GDM problems. In this paper, we firstly propose the model of complete interval distributed preference relation (CIDPR) based on the concept of linguistic distribution with interval symbolic proportions, distribution linguistic preference relation (DLPR) and IDPR. Secondly, the additive consistency index of CIDPR is defined to measure the consistency level of expert’s judgment, and an adjustment algorithm is proposed for converting inconsistent CIDPR to an acceptable consistent level. Thirdly, since trust relation is a critical factor in the generation of experts’ weights and the adjustment of experts’ opinions, consensus reaching process (CRP) is designed to take into account distributed linguistic trust relations under social network analysis (SNA). In the proposed adjustment mechanism, non-consensus individual should modify opinion towards his/her trusted and highly weighted expert. The advantage of the proposed inconsistent CIDPR adjustment model can maximally retain the information in the original distribution, while the CRP has a relatively fast convergent speed and good practicality. An illustrative example of strategic new product selection is conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method and its potential in supporting realistic GDM problems.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

E.; Roberts, M. J.; Garcia-Carreras, L.; Ackerley, D.; Reeder, M. J.; Lock, A. P.; Schiemann, R.","2015","There are some long-established biases in atmospheric models that originate from the representation of tropical convection. Previously, it has been difficult to separate cause and effect because errors are often the result of a number of interacting biases. Recently, researchers have gained the ability to run multiyear global climate model simulations with grid spacings small enough to switch the convective parameterization off, which permits the convection to develop explicitly. There are clear improvements to the initiation of convective storms and the diurnal cycle of rainfall in the convection-permitting simulations, which enables a new process-study approach to model bias identification. In this study, multiyear global atmosphere-only climate simulations with and without convective parameterization are undertaken with the Met Office Unified Model and are analyzed over the Maritime Continent region, where convergence from sea-breeze circulations is key for convection initiation. The analysis shows that, although the simulation with parameterized convection is able to reproduce the key rain-forming sea-breeze circulation, the parameterization is not able to respond realistically to the circulation. A feedback of errors also occurs: the convective parameterization causes rain to fall in the early morning, which cools and wets the boundary layer, reducing the land-sea temperature contrast and weakening the sea breeze. This is, however, an effect of the convective bias, rather than a cause of it. Improvements to how and when convection schemes trigger convection will improve both the timing and location of tropical rainfall and representation of sea-breeze circulations.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Frontal clouds over southern England and the sea areas around the British Isles, maritime convective clouds over the North Atlantic, and continental convective clouds over New Mexico and Montana in the USA are studied. Ice concentrations are seen to be several orders of magnitude higher than those which could be attributed to primary nucleation of ice nuclei at cloud-top temperatures. Thus secondary ice multiplication processes must be operating in each cloud type. Evidence suggests that the process of ice splinter production during riming, the Hallett-Mossop process which operates at temperatures around -6 °C, is the dominant mechanism operating. The data analysed are parametrized as phase ratios, the fraction of cloud condensed water found in the liquid phase, and the variation of this phase ratio with temperature is examined. The greatest differences are observed between frontal and convective clouds, although smaller differences between continental and maritime clouds of the same type are also seen. In general, frontal clouds possess very high fractions of ice across a wide range of temperature. In contrast, convective clouds exhibit a wide range of phase ratio across the whole temperature range observed. These differences are attributed to the greater vertical wind velocities present in convective clouds. These parametrizations have been used in the UK Meteorological Office Global Climate Model. They are valid for clouds which span the Hallett-Mossop splinter-production temperature range.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

J.; Lindley, S. J.; Smith, C. L.","1 Sep 2013","Urban areas are characterised by large proportions of impervious surfaces which increases rainwater runoff and the potential for surface water flooding. Increased precipitation is predicted under current climate change projections, which will put further pressure on urban populations and infrastructure. Roof greening can be used within flood mitigation schemes to restore the urban hydrological balance of cities. Intensive green roofs, with their deeper substrates and higher plant biomass, are able to retain greater quantities of runoff, and there is a need for more studies on this less common type of green roof which also investigate the effect of factors such as age and vegetation composition. Runoff quantities from an aged intensive green roof in Manchester, UK, were analysed for 69 rainfall events, and compared to those on an adjacent paved roof. Average retention was 65.7% on the green roof and 33.6% on the bare roof. A comprehensive soil classification revealed the substrate, a mineral soil, to be in good general condition and also high in organic matter content which can increase the water holding capacity of soils. Large variation in the retention data made the use of predictive regression models unfeasible. This variation arose from complex interactions between Antecedant Dry Weather Period (ADWP), season, monthly weather trends, and rainfall duration, quantity and peak intensity. However, significantly lower retention was seen for high rainfall events, and in autumn, which had above average rainfall. The study period only covers one unusually wet year, so a longer study may uncover relationships to factors which can be applied to intensive roofs elsewhere. Annual rainfall retention for Manchester city centre could be increased by 2.3% by a 10% increase in intensive green roof construction. The results of this study will be of particular interest to practitioners implementing greenspace adaptation in temperate and cool maritime climates. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This work represents the most comprehensive evaluation of oceanic OM emission inventories to date, by employing aerosol composition measurements obtained from campaigns with wide spatial and temporal coverage. The model underestimates AOD over the remote ocean on average by 0.02 (21 %), compared to satellite observations, but provides an unbiased simulation of ground-based Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations. Comparison with cruise data demonstrates that the GEOS-Chem simulation of marine sulfate, with the mean observed values ranging between 0.22 μg mg-3 and 1.34 μg m-3, is generally unbiased, however surface organic matter (OM) concentrations, with the mean observed concentrations between 0.07 μg mg-3 and 0.77 μg mg -3, are underestimated by a factor of 2-5 for the standard model run. Addition of a sub-micron marine OM source of approximately 9 TgC yr -1 brings the model into agreement with the ship-based measurements, however this additional OM source does not explain the model underestimate of marine AOD. The model underestimate of marine AOD is therefore likely the result of a combination of satellite retrieval bias and a missing marine aerosol source (which exhibits a different spatial pattern than existing aerosol in the model). © 2011 Author(s).","Maritime","University of Manchester"

In situ measurements were made in the outflow from maritime thunderstorms near Kwajalein, part of the Marshall Islands and of thunderstorms with more continental aerosol concentrations both in the United States and near Darwin, Australia over the Tiwi Islands. Images of chain-like aggregates of small ice crystals, some with plate-like shapes were observed with a state-of-the-art microphysics probe in the outflow regions of continental storms that were typically highly electrified, displaying lightning. The 'chains' were not found in the outflow regions of maritime storms that are typically less electrically active. The striking similarity between these images and previous laboratory measurements of ice aggregation in electric fields are remarked upon. This evidence is used to support the theory that chain aggregates of ice crystals may be common in fully glaciated regions of continental thunderstorms, where ice-particle number densities are high, and their presence is due to the electric field alignment of ice crystals with subsequent enhancement of the aggregation process by dipole induction resulting in short-range attractive inter-particle forces. It is not confirmed where in the storm the aggregates were typically formed; however, in the Darwin thunderstorms they were noted to occur with the highest frequency towards the cirrus outflow base when the cirrus base altitude was high, and generally decreased in frequency with increasing distance from the storm. The potential consequences of electrically enhanced aggregation in continental storms and related electric field mechanisms along with the role of homogeneous freezing in intense thunderclouds are discussed. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2005.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

While finding resonance with claims that the hierarchical, state-dominated provision of policing has been uprooted by a move toward a more polycentric, networked mode of governance (Shearing & Wood, 2003; Brodeur, 2010), it is suggested that the emerging security network along the Welsh coastline serves to enhance the policing and surveillance functions of the state. By co-ordinating otherwise disparate institutions, the policing initiative aspires to incorporate a range of agents and agencies in the crime control complex. In sketching a map of this policing arrangement, the article raises the question of how localised security arrangements can be imagined.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This model uses temperature and precipitation to calculate snow accumulation, snow and ice melting, and possible refreezing of meltwater at regular altitude intervals on a glacier. Model parameters are still somewhat uncertain and are established for individual glaciers by tuning the model mass balance as a function of altitude to fit observed data. The model has been applied to 37 glaciers in different parts of the world so far and some details are given for Storglaciaren to illustrate the approach. The sensitivity of modelled mass balance to a +1°C temperature increase shows a wide range for the 37 glaciers from about 0.1 to 1.3 m water a-1.

Subsequently, the bridges, piers and other encountering vessels in a waterway are characterized as collision potential fields using an Artificial Potential Field (APF) model, and the corresponding coefficients can be trained in terms of the historical vessel distributions. As a result, the positional collision potential of any monitoring vessel can be obtained through overlapping all the collision potential fields together. The probabilities of authenticity and the collision potential are further formulated as two pieces of evidence on which the Dempster’s rule of combination is used to reason the collision probability of a monitoring target. The vessels associated with high collision probabilities can be highlighted for supervisors’ attention, as they potentially pose high risks to safety.

The particle optical depth and PBL height increased with increasing distance from the North Atlantic. Mean summer PBL heights were 1.9-2.8 km at the continental sites of Leipzig, Belsk, and Minsk.

The standard deviation of net balance is strongly correlated with the mass-balance amplitude (half the difference between winter and summer balances) for 60 glaciers, so the amplitude can be estimated from net balance standard deviation for the other 55 glaciers where winter and summer balances are unavailable. The observed and calculated mass-balance amplitudes for the 115 glaciers show contrasts between the Arctic and lower latitudes, and between maritime and continental regions. The interannual variability of mass balance means that balances must be measured for at least a few years to determine a statistically reliable mean balance for any glacier. The net balance of the Greenland ice sheet is still not accurately known, but its standard deviation is here estimated to be about ±0.24 m a-1, in agreement with other Arctic glaciers. Mass-balance variability of this magnitude implies that the ice sheet can thicken or thin by several metres over 20-30 years without giving statistically significant evidence of non-zero balance under present climate.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

We verify the tuned model by comparing modelled accumulation with winter balance where this has been measured (presently for 180 glaciers). The modelled accumulation naturally depends upon the vertical lapse rate (VLR) for temperature and the degree-day factor (DDF) for snowmelt. Both are somewhat uncertain in high-mountain areas, but modelled accumulation and measured winter balance are in reasonable agreement for most glaciers. The degree-day model predicts a non-linear relation between accumulation and summer temperature at the ELA as assumed by many workers, but we find a family of curves rather than a single universal curve. Maritime glaciers with low annual temperature range have proportionally more accumulation than continental glaciers with high annual temperature range for a similar summer mean temperature. Averages of winter balance for the five main geographical regions where mass-balance data are available agree well with annual accumulation from the degree-day model.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Objective To assess the effect of chest tube size and analgesia (NSAIDs vs opiates) on pain and clinical efficacy related to pleurodesis in patients with malignant pleural effusion. Design, Setting, and Participants A 2×2 factorial phase 3 randomized clinical trial among 320 patients requiring pleurodesis in 16 UK hospitals from 2007 to 2013. Interventions Patients undergoing thoracoscopy (n = 206; clinical decision if biopsy was required) received a 24F chest tube and were randomized to receive opiates (n = 103) vs NSAIDs (n = 103), and those not undergoing thoracoscopy (n = 114) were randomized to 1 of 4 groups (24F chest tube and opioids [n = 28]; 24F chest tube and NSAIDs [n = 29]; 12F chest tube and opioids [n = 29]; or 12F chest tube and NSAIDs [n = 28]). Main Outcomes and Measures Pain while chest tubewas in place (0-to100-mmvisual analog scale [VAS] 4 times/d; superiority comparison) and pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months (failure defined as need for further pleural intervention; noninferiority comparison; margin, 15%). Results Pain scores in the opiate group (n = 150) vs the NSAID group (n = 144) were not significantly different (mean VAS score, 23.8mmvs 22.1 mm; adjusted difference,-1.5 mm; 95%CI,-5.0 to 2.0 mm; P =.40), but the NSAID group required more rescue analgesia (26.3%vs 38.1%; rate ratio, 2.1; 95%CI, 1.3-3.4; P =.003). Pleurodesis failure occurred in 30 patients (20%) in the opiate group and 33 (23%) in the NSAID group, meeting criteria for noninferiority (difference,-3%; 1-sided 95%CI,-10% to; P =.004 for noninferiority). Pain scores were lower among patients in the 12F chest tube group (n = 54) vs the 24F group (n = 56) (mean VAS score, 22.0mmvs 26.8 mm; adjusted difference,-6.0 mm; 95%CI,-11.7 to-0.2 mm; P =.04) and 12F chest tubes vs 24F chest tubes were associated with higher pleurodesis failure (30% vs 24%), failing to meet noninferiority criteria (difference,-6%; 1-sided 95%CI,-20% to P =.14 for noninferiority). Complications during chest tube insertion occurred more commonly with 12F tubes (14%vs 24%; odds ratio, 1.91; P =.20). Conclusions and Relevance Use of NSAIDs vs opiates resulted in no significant difference in pain scores but was associated with more rescue medication. NSAID use resulted in noninferior rates of pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months. Placement of 12F chest tubes vs 24F chest tubes was associated with a statistically significant but clinically modest reduction in pain but failed to meet noninferiority criteria for pleurodesis efficacy.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This study proposed a unique technique which led to the enhancement of the hydration and carbonation processes via the synergistic combination of microbial carbonation process (MCP) with a hydration agent (HA) that enabled the self‑carbonation of RMC-based mixes without using of any special curing environments. Through hydrolysing urea (CO(NH2)2) using ureolytic bacteria, CO32− ions were produced to facilitate the carbonation of dissolved Mg2+ ions to form hydrated magnesium hydroxy carbonates (HMHCs). The self‑carbonation of RMC enabled by the MCP resulted in formation of brucite with a poor crystallinity and its rapid conversion into HMHCs, which improved the setting time and compressive strength of RMC-based samples. The simultaneous use of MCP with 2 M urea and HA revealed HMHCs with improved morphologies, resulting in the highest compressive strength (~15 MPa).","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Monocular, inverted-light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray analyser were used to observe colonisation of site specimens, enabling the further understanding of this interaction. Algal filaments have been observed growing within the matrix of a polymer sealant. Growth has been observed tunnelling within and adhered to the surface of the sealant. This degradation mechanism will weaken the material bond as a direct result of the physical activity of an organism, resulting from its growth. Loss of material, either through biodeterioration or through other mechanical means, such as tidal action, is not the primary cause of degradation, but it should be considered with associated environmental conditions, to exacerbate the condition.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Temperature and precipitation climate at the equilibrium-line altitude of glaciers expressed by the degree-day factor for melting snow","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/temperature-and-precipitation-climate-at-the-equilibrium-line-alt","Braithwaite, R. J.","2008","Several authors relate accumulation (or precipitation) at the glacier equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) to summer mean temperature using exponential or power-law functions. I analyze the accumulation-temperature relation at the ELA with a degree-day model using data from the 1992 paper by A. Ohmura and others. The dataset includes estimates at the ELA of winter balance and of 'winter balance plus summer precipitation' which represent respectively low and high estimates of annual accumulation, which is seldom measured. The Ohmura dataset only lists summer mean temperature, but I recover monthly temperatures for the whole year for 66 of the glaciers by assuming sinusoidal temperature variation through the year and using annual temperature range from a gridded climatology. Monthly degree-day sums are then estimated from monthly mean temperature and summed to give annual totals so degree-day factors for melting snow at the ELA are obtained. The degree-day factors fall close to those reported in the literature for glacier snowmelt, with averages of 3.5 ± 1.4 and 4.6 ± 1.4 mm d-1 K-1 for low- and high-accumulation estimates on the 66 glaciers. The degree-day model gives a family of accumulation-temperature curves that depend upon the annual temperature range, representing the contrast between maritime and continental climates.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

R.; Clark, C. D.; Hughes, A. L. C.","30 Jan 2008","Controversy exists over the extent of glaciation in Eastern Asia at the Last Glacial Maximum: complete ice sheet cover vs. restricted mountain icefields (an area discrepancy equivalent to 3.7 Greenland Ice Sheets). Current arguments favour the latter. However, significant last glacial ice-rafted debris (IRD) exists in NW Pacific ocean cores, which must have been sourced from a major ice sheet somewhere bordering the North Pacific. The origin of this IRD is addressed through a combination of marine core analysis, iceberg trajectory modelling and remote sensing of glacial geomorphology. We find compelling evidence for two stages of glaciation centred on the Kamchatka area of maritime southeast Russia during the last glacial, with ice extent intermediate in size between previous maximum and minimum reconstructions. Furthermore, a significant increase in iceberg flux precedes, and accompanies, a substantial marine core ash deposit at around 40 ka BP. We speculate that rapid decay of the first stage of the ice sheet may have triggered substantial volcanic activity.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

It identifies significant changes in a piece of machinery’s performance, which could be indicative of a developing fault and potentially lead to significant operational cost and even major disruption in manufacturing and production.Implementation of condition monitoring in a typical industrial environment requires support by a system of interconnected software and hardware elements. Traditionally, these systems were developed merely for the specific task of asset health monitoring. However, the digitalisation wave of Industry 4.0 and wider application of artificial intelligence-based (smart) technologies has provided a great opportunity for further development of these systems, thereby making substantial contributions to the efficiency of manufacturing and production.As a part of an Innovate UK-funded project, an intelligent condition monitoring system (called JANUS) was designed and developed in the R&D division of Monition Limited (now RS Components Limited) in order to contribute to operational efficiency, not only by means of reducing asset downtime via more accurate prediction of asset health condition but by more efficient use of technicians/labour resources. In order to meet these objectives, JANUS used machine learning and decision-making algorithms together to form an AI-DSS-based platform for analysis of condition monitoring data.","AI","University of Manchester"
"The four dimensions of contestable AI diagnostics- A patient-centric approach to explainable AI","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/the-four-dimensions-of-contestable-ai-diagnostics-a-patient-centr","Ploug, T.; Holm, S.","Jul 2020","The problem of the explainability of AI decision-making has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In considering AI diagnostics we suggest that explainability should be explicated as ‘effective contestability’. Taking a patient-centric approach we argue that patients should be able to contest the diagnoses of AI diagnostic systems, and that effective contestation of patient-relevant aspect of AI diagnoses requires the availability of different types of information about 1) the AI system's use of data, 2) the system's potential biases, 3) the system performance, and 4) the division of labour between the system and health care professionals. We justify and define thirteen specific informational requirements that follows from ‘contestability’. We further show not only that contestability is a weaker requirement than some of the proposed criteria of explainability, but also that it does not introduce poorly grounded double standards for AI and health care professionals’ diagnostics, and does not come at the cost of AI system performance. Finally, we briefly discuss whether the contestability requirements introduced here are domain-specific.","AI","University of Manchester"

"Cynical Technical Practice: From AI to APIs","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/cynical-technical-practice-from-ai-to-apis","Hind, S.; Seitz, T.","15 Oct 2022","In this article, we examine how critical thinking, methods and design are used within the tech industry, using Philip Agre’s notion of critical technical practice (CTP) to consider the rise of ‘cynical’ technical practice. Arguments by tech firms that their AI systems are ethical, contextual, situated or fair, as well as APIs that are privacy-compliant and offer greater user control, are now commonplace. Yet, these justifications routinely disguise the organisational, and economic, reasons for the development of technical systems and features. The article considers how different forms of ‘technical critique’ are used by technical practitioners such as software engineers, applying Agre’s work on CTP, AI planning, grammars of action and empowerment to evaluate, and contextualise these justifications. As Agre understood, technical practitioners are not necessarily ‘a-critical’ or ‘uncritical’ in their approach to the design of technological systems or methods, but ordinarily compare the utility or performance of such according to a golden ethic: ‘does it work?’. Drawing on Agre’s studies of AI in the 1990s, the article considers how and what Agre considered to be the ‘Cartesian soul’ of AI research, on linguistic structuralism, and continues to frame much work within the wider tech industry today. Yet increasingly, as the article shows, ‘narrow’ and cynical forms of technical criticality are being used to legitimise, and publicise, corporate strategies of tech firms, whether through the development of AI systems by automotive start-ups such as Comma, or the management of relations with external developers through APIs, in the case of Facebook. Rather than judging the moral character of technical practitioners, however, the article offers an approach – via the work of Philip Agre – to examine how critical thinking is used, and often abused, within and beyond the tech industry.","AI","University of Manchester"

However, there is some skepticism in the web community that AI can be made "web appropriate" and work on a web scale. I will introduce the Semantic Web concept and give a number of examples of how AI has already contributed to its development, primarily through knowledge representation languages. I will explore the reasons why the Semantic Web is a challenging environment for AI. I will suggest that this could be a killer app for AI, but we must recognize that the web is a vast and untidy place, and only a combination of approaches will yield success. © 2002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","AI","University of Manchester"

We argue that the application of relevant artificial intelligence (AI) technology could help address this challenge. Employing interactively prompted narrative storytelling, we investigate the effectiveness of sentiment analysis (SA) on extracting valuable CE insights from primary qualitative data generated via chatbot interviews.Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on a granular and semantically clear framework we developed for studying CE feelings, an AI-augmented chatbot was designed. The chatbot interviewed a crowdsourced sample of consumers about their recalled service experience feelings. By combining free-text and closed-ended questions, we were able to compare extracted sentiment polarities against established measurement scales and empirically validate our novel approach.Findings – We demonstrate that SA can effectively extract CE feelings from primary chatbot data. Our findings also suggest that further enhancement in accuracy can be achieved via improvements in the interplay between the chatbot interviewer and SA extraction algorithms.Research limitations/implications – The proposed customer-centric approach can help service companies to study and better understand CE feelings in a cost-effective and scalable manner. The AI-augmented chatbots can also help companies foster immersive and engaging relationships with customers. Our study focuses on feelings, warranting further research on AI’s value in studying other CE elements.Originality/value – The unique inquisitive role of AI-infused chatbots in conducting interviews and analyzing data in realtime, offers considerable potential for studying CE and other subjective constructs.","AI","University of Manchester"

Further complicating this 2x2 framework is whether the human, either customer or employee, recognizes when they are interacting with a non-human exchange partner. Accordingly, we develop an evolved service encounter framework and, in doing so, introduce the concept of counterfeit service, interspecific service (AIto-human), interAI service (AI-to-AI), and offer a research agenda focused on the implementation of AI in dyadic service exchanges.","AI","University of Manchester"

Reward gaming occurs when the agent's reward function is mis-specified and the agent can achieve a high reward by altering or fooling, in some way, its sensors rather than by performing the desired actions. Our first heuristic tracks the rewards encountered in the environment and converts high rewards that fall outside the normal distribution into penalities. Our second heuristic relies on the existence of some validation action that an agent can take to check the reward. In this heuristic, on encountering an abnormally high reward, the agent performs a validation step before either accepting the reward as it is, or converting it into a penalty. We evaluate the performance of these heuristics on variants of the tomato watering problem from the AI Safety Gridworlds suite.","AI","University of Manchester"

Defining the therapeutic target of statin therapy in terms of serum apolipoprotein B (apo B) rather than LDL cholesterol could also help to optimize statin treatment. Deciding whether a therapeutic response is adequate also requires knowledge of whether there is persisting hypertriglyceridaemia, because this gives an indication of whether small dense LDL is likely to have been satisfactorily reduced. Raising low levels of HDL, probably best measured as apo AI, may also prove to be an important aim of treatment. This is, however, a more complex issue and also depends on the mechanism by which a particular therapy alters HDL levels and on whether the capacity of HDL to perform its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative functions is restored.

Complex ML models provide good prediction accuracy; however, the opacity of ML models does not provide sufficient assurance for their adoption in the automation of lending decisions. This paper presents an explainable AI decision-support-system to automate the loan underwriting process by belief-rule-base (BRB). This system can accommodate human knowledge and can also learn from historical data by supervised learning. The hierarchical structure of BRB can accommodates factual and heuristic rules. The system can explain the chain of events leading to a decision for a loan application by the importance of an activated rule and the contribution of antecedent attributes in the rule. A business case study on automation of mortgage underwriting is demonstrated to show that the BRB system can provide a good trade-off between accuracy and explainability. The textual explanation produced by the activation of rules could be used as a reason for denial of a loan. The decision-making process for an application can be comprehended by the significance of rules in providing the decision and contribution of its antecedent attributes.","AI","University of Manchester"

As a case study, this is applied to a 3D LiDAR scan of a masonry bridge with localised details such as anchors, cracks and patches of vegetation. The process comprises 4 stages: For each point, the distance to its neighbouring point is calculated using a nearest-neighbours search. Afterwards, 3D point cloud data is projected onto a 2D plane using principal component analysis. Next, the variables are mapped into the feature space where they are grouped using a clustering algorithm. Clusters correspond to specific physical features within the point cloud. Points within these clusters are assigned a feature weight that dictates their level of bias compared to points that do not belong to an engineering feature. Finally, a weighted self-organising map (SOM) algorithm is applied to learn the topology of the original point cloud, with a specific focus on feature points. This algorithm is a type of artificial neural network that uses competitive learning to generate an output map iteratively adjusted to represent the input. An advantage of the SOM is that the output map can be used to define the position of vertices in a finite element mesh. The results show that the standard SOM was able to reduce the data size by over 90%. However, such a reduction in data size risks loss of smaller engineering features. Upon application of a feature weight, the method was able to produce the same data reduction with up to 35% decrease in quantization error compared to a standard SOM. The research is of timely importance. It reduces the computational cost of point cloud visualisation and improves the reverse engineering process, enabling conversion of point clouds into CFD and FE meshes. The work will benefit academics, researchers and engineers in developing their models.","AI","University of Manchester"

We interviewed 16 participants with varying backgrounds of expertise, and presented two potential use cases for evaluation; a navigation scenario and a task scheduling scenario. Through an inductive thematic analysis we identified the aspects of a deployment that experts want to know from explainable systems and we outline how these associate with the folk conceptual theory of explanation, a framework in which people explain behaviours. We established that an intelligent system should explain its reasons for an action, its expectations of itself, changes in the environment that impact decision making, probabilities and the elements within them, safety implications and mitigation strategies, robot health and component failures during decision making in nuclear deployments.

We organized two 5-day citizens’ juries in the UK with 18 jurors each. Jurors considered 3 AI systems with different levels of accuracy and explainability in 2 healthcare and 2 non-healthcare scenarios. Per scenario, jurors voted for their preferred system; votes were analyzed descriptively. Qualitative data on considerations behind their preferences included transcribed audio-recordings of plenary sessions, observational field notes, outputs from small group work and free-text comments accompanying jurors’ votes; qualitative data were analyzed thematically by scenario, per and across AI systems.RESULTSIn healthcare scenarios, jurors favored accuracy over explainability, whereas in non-healthcare contexts they either valued explainability equally to, or more than, accuracy. Jurors’ considerations in favor of accuracy regarded the impact of decisions on individuals and society, and the potential to increase efficiency of services. Reasons for emphasizing explainability included increased opportunities for individuals and society to learn and improve future prospects and enhanced ability for humans to identify and resolve system biases.CONCLUSIONCitizens may value explainability of AI systems in healthcare less than in non-healthcare domains and less than often assumed by professionals, especially when weighed against system accuracy. The public should therefore be actively consulted when developing policy on AI explainability.","AI","University of Manchester"

AI can assist boards as they consider societal interests as it can process data in a manner and at a speed that is beyond the capability of manual systems. With well-designed algorithmic steps, AI can provide guidance that is independent of subjective judgements biased by shareholder short-termism and board opportunism. Company law should be revised to support AI-assisted corporate development by mitigating the legal risks of boards and by encouraging directors to use AI to achieve the ESG goals of the company.

In the USA, more COVID related deaths have been reported than the combined fatalities of the Pearl Harbor War and the September 11 terror attacks. COVID-19 itself is highly infectious and the speed at which it can mutate is rapid, leading to multiple varieties and strands of active coronaviruses, and rapid increases in the numbers of infected cases and deaths. The virus has infected more than 217 million of the population worldwide before the end of August 2021, yet in early March 2020, the total infected cases were still not reaching 100,000 (WHO, 2021).The global challenge has changed how we live, with social distancing measures and face masks mandates, and has shone a spotlight on our healthcare capabilities, highlighting shortages of medical resources and capacity, and raising issues of equitable access to vaccines and drugs. Governments of different countries have been challenged to deal with the crisis using limited resources and have emphasized different policies suiting their national strategies (Ecke, 2020; Ranney et al., 2020).Machine Learning, AI and Big Data research, scientists can offer recommendations, new discoveries and predictive methods in addressing both societal impact (Gupta et al., 2018) and medical services (van der Sommen et al., 2020). Big Data and cloud computing (Chang, 2014; Hosseinian-Far et al., 2018), the Internet of Things (Sicari et al., 2016), and Artificial Intelligence techniques (Vaishya et al., 2020) have significantly contributed to developing an understanding of the virus, identifying and developing treatments and managing and tracking the social and economic impact of the pandemic, and predicting trends (Tuli et al., 2020). Scientists can better understand the structure and weaknesses of virus variants through simulations offered by ML algorithms, leading to vaccine development with higher efficacy (Rotondo et al., 2021). Challenges addressed range from COVID-19 diagnosis and infection confirmation based on a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Kim et al., 2020) to privacy protection and secure transmission of messages among medical professionals (Wang et al., 2020).","AI","University of Manchester"

A.","22 Jan 2023","Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming part of the everyday. During this transition, people’s intention to use AI technologies is still unclear and emotions such as fear are influencing it. In this paper, we focus on autonomous cars to first verify empirically the extent to which people fear AI and then examine the impact that fear has on their intention to use AI-driven vehicles. Our research is based on a systematic survey and it reveals that while individuals are largely afraid of cars that are driven by AI, they are nonetheless willing to adopt this technology as soon as possible. To explain this tension, we extend our analysis beyond just fear and show that people also believe that AI-driven cars will generate many individual, urban and global benefits. Subsequently, we employ our empirical findings as the foundations of a theoretical framework meant to illustrate the main factors that people ponder when they consider the use of AI tech. In addition to offering a comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of AI technology acceptance, this paper provides a nuanced understanding of the tension that exists between the fear and adoption of AI, capturing what exactly people fear and intend to do.","AI","University of Manchester"

While Buber introduces the idea of dialogic space, an idea which has proved useful for the analysis of dialogic education with technology, his account fails to engage adequately with the role of technology. This paper offers an introduction to the significance of the I-It/I-Thou duality of technology in relation with opening dialogic space. This is followed by a short schematic history of educational technology which reveals the role technology plays, not only in opening dialogic space, but also in expanding dialogic space. The expansion of dialogic space is an expansion of what it means to be ‘us’ as dialogic engagement facilitates the incorporation, into our shared sense of identity, of aspects of reality that are initially experienced as alien or ‘other’. Augmenting Buber with an alternative understanding of dialogic space enables us to see how dialogue mediated by technology, as well as dialogue with monologised fragments of technology (robots), can, through education, lead to an expansion of what it means to be human.","AI","University of Manchester"

S.","21 Apr 2021","Asthma (chronic allergic airways disease, AAD) is characterized by airway inflammation (AI), airway remodeling (AWR) and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Current treatments for AAD mainly focus on targeting AI and its contribution AHR, with the use of corticosteroids. However, there are no therapies for the direct treatment of AWR, which can contribute to airway obstruction, AHR and corticosteroid resistance independently of AI. The acute heart failure drug, serelaxin (recombinant human gene-2 relaxin, RLX), has potential anti-remodeling and anti-fibrotic effects but only when continuously infused or injected to overcome its short half-life. To alleviate this limitation, we conjugated serelaxin to biodegradable and noninflammatory nanoparticles (NP-RLX) and evaluated their therapeutic potential on measures of AI, AWR and AHR, when intranasally delivered to a preclinical rodent model of chronic AAD and TGF-β1-stimulated collagen gel contraction from asthma patient-derived myofibroblasts. NP-RLX was preferentially taken-up by CD206+-infiltrating and CD68+-tissue resident alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, NP-RLX ameliorated the chronic AAD-induced AI, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), chemokines (CCL2, CCL11) and the pro-fibrotic TGF-β1/IL-1β axis on AWR and resulting AHR, as well as human myofibroblast-induced collagen gel contraction, to a similar extent as unconjugated RLX. Hence, NP-RLX represents a novel strategy for treating the central features of asthma.","AI","University of Manchester"

B.; Holm, S.","13 Dec 2021","BACKGROUND: Certain types of artificial intelligence (AI), that is, deep learning models, can outperform health care professionals in particular domains. Such models hold considerable promise for improved diagnostics, treatment, and prevention, as well as more cost-efficient health care. They are, however, opaque in the sense that their exact reasoning cannot be fully explicated. Different stakeholders have emphasized the importance of the transparency/explainability of AI decision making. Transparency/explainability may come at the cost of performance. There is need for a public policy regulating the use of AI in health care that balances the societal interests in high performance as well as in transparency/explainability. A public policy should consider the wider public's interests in such features of AI.OBJECTIVE: This study elicited the public's preferences for the performance and explainability of AI decision making in health care and determined whether these preferences depend on respondent characteristics, including trust in health and technology and fears and hopes regarding AI.METHODS: We conducted a choice-based conjoint survey of public preferences for attributes of AI decision making in health care in a representative sample of the adult Danish population. Initial focus group interviews yielded 6 attributes playing a role in the respondents' views on the use of AI decision support in health care: (1) type of AI decision, (2) level of explanation, (3) performance/accuracy, (4) responsibility for the final decision, (5) possibility of discrimination, and (6) severity of the disease to which the AI is applied. In total, 100 unique choice sets were developed using fractional factorial design. In a 12-task survey, respondents were asked about their preference for AI system use in hospitals in relation to 3 different scenarios.RESULTS: Of the 1678 potential respondents, 1027 (61.2%) participated. The respondents consider the physician having the final responsibility for treatment decisions the most important attribute, with 46.8% of the total weight of attributes, followed by explainability of the decision (27.3%) and whether the system has been tested for discrimination (14.8%). Other factors, such as gender, age, level of education, whether respondents live rurally or in towns, respondents' trust in health and technology, and respondents' fears and hopes regarding AI, do not play a significant role in the majority of cases.CONCLUSIONS: The 3 factors that are most important to the public are, in descending order of importance, (1) that physicians are ultimately responsible for diagnostics and treatment planning, (2) that the AI decision support is explainable, and (3) that the AI system has been tested for discrimination. Public policy on AI system use in health care should give priority to such AI system use and ensure that patients are provided with information.","AI","University of Manchester"

J. S.; Felzmann, H.; Dowding, D.; Lee, J. J.","31 Jul 2022","Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are being applied in nursing and midwifery to improve decision-making, patient care and service delivery. However, an understanding of the real-world applications of AI across all domains of both professions is limited.Objectives: To synthesise literature on AI in nursing and midwifery.Methods: CINAHL, Embase, PubMed and Scopus were searched using relevant terms. Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened against eligibility criteria. Data were extracted, analysed, and findings were presented in a descriptive summary. The PRISMA checklist guided the review conduct and reporting.Results: One hundred and forty articles were included. Nurses’ and midwives' involvement in AI varied, with some taking an active role in testing, using or evaluating AI-based technologies; however, many studies did not include either profession. AI was mainly applied in clinical practice to direct patient care (n = 115, 82.14%), with fewer studies focusing on administration and management (n = 21, 15.00%), or education (n = 4, 2.85%). Benefits reported were primarily potential as most studies trained and tested AI algorithms. Only a handful (n = 8, 7.14%) reported actual benefits when AI techniques were applied in real-world settings. Risks and limitations included poor quality datasets that could introduce bias, the need for clinical interpretation of AI-based results, privacy and trust issues, and inadequate AI expertise among the professions.Conclusion: Digital health datasets should be put in place to support the testing, use, and evaluation of AI in nursing and midwifery. Curricula need to be developed to educate the professions about AI, so they can lead and participate in these digital initiatives in healthcare.Relevance for clinical practice: Adult, paediatric, mental health and learning disability nurses, along with midwives should have a more active role in rigorous, interdisciplinary research evaluating AI-based technologies in professional practice to determine their clinical efficacy as well as their ethical, legal and social implications in healthcare.","AI","University of Manchester"

However, how formal and relational governance effects Information Systems suppliers who provide AI services has not been studied. Based on an exploratory research amongst eight suppliers and two market research advisors, we conducted 18 expert interviews and found evidence how formal contractual and relational governance affects AI outsourcing. The results indicate various forms of contractual models in which some cater for clients’ needs specifically, e.g. outcome-based, experience-driven Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Our examination provides insights that formal and relational Information Systems (IS) outsourcing governance are complementary in cases where clients and suppliers co-develop AI. For our research, we adapted the outsourcing governance model of Lioliou et al. (Inf Syst J 24:503–535, 2014), including their emphasis on the psychological contract. We contribute to IS outsourcing literature by exploring, beyond contract management insights, differences between suppliers in providing AI services. Our study acknowledges that AI outsourcing shift the emphasis from a transactional type of arrangement to a relational type of outsourcing arrangement.

There is limited evidence to support the use of similar language programmes with older children who have weak language skills at Key Stage 2 of the National Curriculum UK.AimsThe aim of this exploratory small-scale trial was to explore the effects of a manualised intervention delivered by trained teaching assistants in mainstream schools for children aged between 7 and 9 years who were identified as having weak oral language skills. MethodsTwenty-one UK mainstream primary schools each selected eight year 3 and year 4 children with weak oral language skills using selection criteria from the Speech Language and Communication Progression Tools (SLCPT). Nominated school staff received training in the new manualised intervention, Talk Boost KS2, then schools were allocated randomly to an Active Intervention (AI) condition or a Waiting Control condition (WC). AI participants received three 40-minute Talk Boost 2 KS2 intervention sessions  per week for eight weeks in small groups. Baseline measures were teacher-reported communication skills on the SLCPT, subtests of the Assessment of Comprehension and Expression (ACE) and the York Assessment of Reading Comprehension (YARC). Outcome measures were completed by evaluation assistants or teachers blind to allocation at the end of A1 or WC and included re-assessment on SLCPT, ACE and YARC, a teacher-reported Learning Behaviours Checklist and a Parent Rating Scale of changes in communication skills. At Time 2, the first AI group ended all intervention and the WC group commenced Talk Boost KS2 intervention. A subset of AI children was followed up one term after the end of intervention (Time 3).Outcomes and resultsProgress in favour of the intervention was found on teacher ratings of speech, language and communication needs (SLCPT) and on the Learning Behaviours Checklist but not on language test scores. Parents of AI children reported improvements in communication and language skills. Reading comprehension scores showed improvement at Time 3 follow up in the active intervention condition. Teaching staff reported significant increases in confidence and knowledge in managing children with weak oral language skills as a result of being involved in the intervention. The findings are discussed in relation to the imperative to provide practical language intervention tools, training and support for education staff. ","AI","University of Manchester"

The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic value of apoptosis and the association between apoptosis and vascularity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Following in-situ end- labelling of DNA, apoptotic cells were quantified by three different indices: as a percentage, either counting total cells (AI-tc) or point-counting (AI-pc), or as cells per area (AI-area). Blood vessels were stained with vWF antibody and vascularity was quantified by three methods. Median values for AI-tc, AI-pc and AI-area were 0.38, 0.32 and 10.7, respectively. High values were associated with improved survival, reaching statistical significance for AI-area (p <0.05). All three apoptotic indices were significantly correlated with each other, but no correlation was found between indices of apoptosis and vascularity. As previously reported, vascularity had no prognostic value. These results indicate that, in NSCLC, vascularity is not informative but apoptotic index may be a useful prognostic factor.","AI","University of Manchester"
"Learning to Play General Video-Games via an Object Embedding Network","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/learning-to-play-general-video-games-via-an-object-embedding-netw","Woof, W.; Chen, K.","2018","Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has proven to be an effective tool for creating general video-game AI. However most current DRL video-game agents learn end-to-end from the video-output of the game, which is superfluous for many applications and creates a number of additional problems. More importantly, directly working on pixel-based raw video data is substantially distinct from what a human player does. In this paper, we present a novel method which enables DRL agents to learn directly from object information. This is obtained via use of an object embedding network (OEN) that compresses a set of object feature vectors of different lengths into a single fixed-length unified feature vector representing the current game-state and fulfills the DRL simultaneously. We evaluate our OEN-based DRL agent by comparing to several state-of-the-art approaches on a selection of games from the GVG-AI Competition. Experimental results suggest that our object-based DRL agent yields performance comparable to that of those approaches used in our comparative study.","AI","University of Manchester"

K.","1 Dec 2009","Background: In primary care, much effort goes into risk factor management. Early recognition of vascular dysfunction in patients should inform intervention to reduce vascular risk. Very few studies have looked at the application of augmentation index (AI) measurement in primary care, particularly in those with impaired glucose handling (IGH) and type 2 diabetes, who have a higher than usual risk of cardiovascular disease.Arterial stiffness assessed via AI, with much less variation than BP, increases inexorably with age and is a potential marker for cardiovascular risk. AI is measured by applanation tonometry and is a non-invasive measure of arterial stiffness.Scientific aims: The main aims are to describe the profile of augmentation index (AI) in patients at elevated cardiometabolic risk. Furthermore to assess its relation to central BP, body mass index (BMI) and HbA1C (type 2 diabetes only) in the age-matched normoglycaemic, IGH and type 2 diabetes participants.Plan of investigation for pilot study: Using the established primary care register for individuals with IGH and type 2 diabetes in Central and Eastern Cheshire, age-matched consecutive attendees (between June and August 2009) at GP clinics in the area will undergo routine investigations. Central blood pressure and AI will be determined (Omron HEM-9000AI).Potential impact of pilot study: To determine whether AI as a predictor of cardiovascular risk may be used to identify at risk individuals for more aggressive management.Evidence to support the use in Primary Care of AI and central BP measurement in patients with IGH and type 2 diabetes.To help GPs to understand the variation in AI by glucose tolerance status and to determine whether glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes is related to AI.In the next stage we will monitor prospectively the impact of targetted intensive management over time.","AI","University of Manchester"

D.; Suzuki, M.; Velakoulis, D.; Pantelis, C.","1 Oct 2008","Abnormal neurodevelopment in midline structures such as the adhesio interthalamica (AI) has been reported in psychotic disorders, but it is unknown whether individuals at risk for the disorder share the AI findings observed in patients with florid psychosis. Magnetic resonance imaging of 162 patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP), 89 patients with chronic schizophrenia, 135 individuals at ultra high-risk (UHR) of psychosis (of whom 39 later developed psychosis), and 87 healthy controls were used to investigate the length and prevalence of the AI. The relation of the AI length to lateral ventricular enlargement was also explored. The patients with FEP and chronic schizophrenia as well as UHR individuals had a shorter AI than the controls, but there was no difference in the AI findings between the UHR individuals who did and did not subsequently develop psychosis. There was a negative correlation between the AI length and lateral ventricular volume in all the diagnostic groups. The absence of the AI was more common in the chronic schizophrenia patients when compared with all other groups. These results support the notion that the AI absence or shorter length could be a neurodevelopmental marker related to vulnerability to psychopathology, but also suggest that schizophrenia patients may manifest progressive brain changes related to ongoing atrophy of the AI after the onset. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This cognitive strategy is termed “intentional stance”. Adopting the intentional stance influences how one will consider, engage and behave towards robots. However, people differ in their likelihood to adopt intentional stance towards robots. Therefore, it seems crucial to assess these interindividual differences. In two studies we developed and validated the structure of a task aiming at evaluating to what extent people adopt intentional stance towards robot actions, the Intentional Stance task (IST). The Intentional Stance Task consists in a task that probes participants’ stance by requiring them to choose the plausibility of a description (mentalistic vs. mechanistic) of behaviour of a robot depicted in a scenario composed of three photographs. Results showed a reliable psychometric structure of the IST. This paper therefore concludes with the proposal of using the IST as a proxy for assessing the degree of adoption of the intentional stance towards robots.","AI","University of Manchester"

At the same time, health inequity remains one of the biggest challenges. Primary care is both a driver and a mitigator of health inequities and with AI gaining traction in primary care, there is a need for a holistic understanding of how AI affect health inequities, through the act of providing care and through potential system effects. This paper presents a systematic scoping review of the ways AI implementation in primary care may impact health inequity.DESIGN: Following a systematic scoping review approach, we searched for literature related to AI, health inequity, and implementation challenges of AI in primary care. In addition, articles from primary exploratory searches were added, and through reference screening.The results were thematically summarised and used to produce both a narrative and conceptual model for the mechanisms by which social determinants of health and AI in primary care could interact to either improve or worsen health inequities.Two public advisors were involved in the review process.ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Peer-reviewed publications and grey literature in English and Scandinavian languages.INFORMATION SOURCES: PubMed, SCOPUS and JSTOR.RESULTS: A total of 1529 publications were identified, of which 86 met the inclusion criteria. The findings were summarised under six different domains, covering both positive and negative effects: (1) access, (2) trust, (3) dehumanisation, (4) agency for self-care, (5) algorithmic bias and (6) external effects. The five first domains cover aspects of the interface between the patient and the primary care system, while the last domain covers care system-wide and societal effects of AI in primary care. A graphical model has been produced to illustrate this. Community involvement throughout the whole process of designing and implementing of AI in primary care was a common suggestion to mitigate the potential negative effects of AI.CONCLUSION: AI has the potential to affect health inequities through a multitude of ways, both directly in the patient consultation and through transformative system effects. This review summarises these effects from a system tive and provides a base for future research into responsible implementation.","AI","University of Manchester"

The system consists of 5 modules: ROI-localization-module (segmentation of teeth and jaws), tooth-localization and numeration-module, periodontitis-module, caries-localization-module, and periapical-lesion-localization-module. These modules use CNN based on state-of-the-art architectures. In total, 1346 CBCT scans were used to train the modules. After annotation and model development, the AI system was tested for diagnostic capabilities of the Diagnocat AI system. 24 dentists participated in the clinical evaluation of the system. 30 CBCT scans were examined by two groups of dentists, where one group was aided by Diagnocat and the other was unaided. The results for the overall sensitivity and specificity for aided and unaided groups were calculated as an aggregate of all conditions. The sensitivity values for aided and unaided groups were 0.8537 and 0.7672 while specificity was 0.9672 and 0.9616 respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.032).

This article provides an updated review on machine learning in burn care and discusses future challenges and the role of healthcare professionals in the successful implementation of AI technologies. Methods: A systematic search was carried out on MEDLINE, Embase and PubMed databases for English-language articles studying machine learning in burns. Articles were reviewed quantitatively and qualitatively for clinical applications, key features, algorithms, outcomes and validation methods. Results: A total of 46 observational studies were included for review. Assessment of burn depth (n = 26), support vector machines (n = 19) and 10-fold cross-validation (n = 11) were the most common application, algorithm and validation tool used, respectively. Conclusion: AI should be incorporated into clinical practice as an adjunct to the experienced burns provider once direct comparative analysis to current gold standards outlining its benefits and risks have been studied. Future considerations must include the development of a burn-specific common framework. Authors should use common validation tools to allow for effective comparisons.

The author argues that the development of AI should continue to adhere to the regulatory objectives of market safety, consumer protection, and market integrity. However, to ensure equality and fairness, access to finance should be made a clear policy choice. In the first part, the author discusses how AI can lead to systemic risks and market manipulation on trading platforms. For example, by examining the use of algorithms for trading on the capital market, the author discerns the regulatory objectives and the possible methods of regulation for peer-to-peer platforms. In the second part, the author discusses how the use of AI to provide consumers with investment advice, such as financial advice provided from robo-advisers, can close the investment advisory gap and provide consumers with access to finance. The current regime does not provide adequate protection to financial consumers in this regard. In the third part, the author discusses how AI can be used as a form of RegTech to streamline compliance processes, thereby increasing competition in financial markets and providing a benefit to consumers. However, this use may be in conflict with privacy, data protection, and ethical concerns. The author makes policy recommendations and suggests some directions for governance in the use of AI in financial services to enhance access to finance. The findings of this paper are relevant to research on the future governance of AI in financial services, public policy innovation, and urban development.","AI","University of Manchester"

The basic idea is to transfer the non-compact definition domain of a nonlinear function to a bounded open set. This transfer is achieved via a one-to-one mapping. It is shown that B-splines neural networks can then be trained and used for controller design. A stable closed-loop system is therefore obtained. A simulation example is included, which demonstrates the use of the new method and obtains the desired results.","AI","University of Manchester"

Three-dimensional (3D) woven composites have superior through-thickness properties compared to two-dimensional (2D) laminates, for example, improved impact damage resistance, high interlaminar fracture toughness and reduced notch sensitivity. The performance of 3D woven preforms is dependent on the fabric architecture which is determined by the binding pattern. For this study, angle interlock (AI) structures with through-thickness binding were manufactured. The AI cracking simulation shows that the transverse component is the one that leads to transverse matrix cracking in the weft yarn under tensile loading. Monitoring of acoustic emission (AE) during mechanical loading is an effective tool in the study of damage processes in glass fiber-reinforced composites. Tests were performed with piezoelectric sensors bonded on a tensile specimen acting as passive receivers of AE signals. An experimental data has been generated which was useful to validate the multi-physics finite element method (MP-FEM), providing insight into the damage behaviour of novel 3D AI glass fibre composites. MP-FEM and experimental data showed that transverse crack generated a predominant flexural mode A0 and also a less energetic extensional mode S0.","AI","University of Manchester"

J.","15 May 2017","'Amelogenesis imperfecta' (AI) describes a group of inherited diseases of dental enamel that have major clinical impact. Here, we identify the aetiology driving AI in mice carrying a p.S55I mutation in enamelin; one of the most commonly mutated proteins underlying AI in humans. Our data indicate that the mutation inhibits the ameloblast secretory pathway leading to ER stress and an activated unfolded protein response (UPR). Initially, with the support of the UPR acting in pro-survival mode, Enamp.S55I heterozygous mice secreted structurally normal enamel. However, enamel secreted thereafter was structurally abnormal; presumably due to the UPR modulating ameloblast behaviour and function in an attempt to relieve ER stress. Homozygous mutant mice failed to produce enamel. We also identified a novel heterozygous ENAMp.L31R mutation causing AI in humans. We hypothesize that ER stress is the aetiological factor in this case of human AI as it shared the characteristic phenotype described above for the Enamp.S55I mouse. We previously demonstrated that AI in mice carrying the Amelxp.Y64H mutation is a proteinopathy. The current data indicate that AI in Enamp.S55I mice is also a proteinopathy, and based on comparative phenotypic analysis, we suggest that human AI resulting from the ENAMp.L31R mutation is another proteinopathic disease. Identifying a common aetiology for AI resulting from mutations in two different genes opens the way for developing pharmaceutical interventions designed to relieve ER stress or modulate the UPR during enamel development to ameliorate the clinical phenotype.","AI","University of Manchester"

Focusing instead on the collective good of community, this chapter assesses how AI will shape our ability to realize this value in contemporary polities. After characterizing the good of community and defining its societal prerequisites, I assess how AI advances will likely shape it in the future. I sketch some positive effects that AI could have: by providing us with unprecedented powers to control the social world, we could, in principle avoid many currently prevailing community-undermining phenomena. Then I contrast this hopeful vision with AI’s challenges. The chapter documents how its implementation has threatened community in existing, imperfect polities through entrenchment and dispersal and how it has contributed to anti-community pathologies and decommunitarization. Next I look at possible structural long-term shifts and their impact on democratic community, namely “datafication,” “automation” and a “disappearing public sphere.” Each of these phenomena challenge our ability to realize the ideal in rapidly transforming circumstances. Finally, I summarize the argument and points to some policies to both mitigate AI’s threats and harness its possibilities. For some challenges, received policy instruments may be sufficient. But for the most significant ones, democratic polities need to develop and implement genuinely new forms of collective political action to control where and how AI is implemented.","AI","University of Manchester"

However, the chemo‐selective enzymatic re‐acylation of glucosamine derivatives, which can introduce new stable functionalities into chitin derivatives, is much less explored. Here we describe an acylase (CmCDA from Cyclobacterium marinum ) that catalyzes the N ‐acylation of glycosamine with a range of carboxylic acids under physiological reaction conditions. This biocatalyst closes an important gap in allowing for the conversion of chitin to complex glycosides, such as C5‐modified sialosides, through the use of highly selective enzyme cascades.","AI","University of Manchester"
"Artificial intelligence, and human workers interaction at team level: A conceptual assessment of the challenges, and potential HRM strategies","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-workers-interaction-at-team-lev","Ahmad, A.; Cooper, C. L.; Khan, Z.; Gölgeci, I.; Ali, I.","28 Jul 2021","Purpose
This paper aims to specifically focus on the challenges that human resource management (HRM) leaders and departments in contemporary organisations face due to close interaction between artificial intelligence (AI) (primarily robots) and human workers especially at the team level. It further discusses important potential strategies, which can be useful to overcome these challenges based on a conceptual review of extant research.
Design/methodology/approach
The current paper undertakes a conceptual work where multiple streams of literature are integrated to present a rather holistic yet critical overview of the relationship between AI (particularly robots) and HRM in contemporary organisations.
Findings
We highlight that interaction and collaboration between human workers and robots is visible in a range of industries and organisational functions, where both are working as team members. This gives rise to unique challenges for HRM function in contemporary organisations where they need to address workers' fear of working with AI, especially in relation to future job loss and difficult dynamics associated with building trust between human workers and AI-enabled robots as team members. Along with these, human workers' task fulfilment expectations with their AI-enabled robot colleagues need to be carefully communicated and managed by HRM staff to maintain the collaborative spirit, as well as future performance evaluations of employees. The authors found that organisational support mechanisms such as facilitating environment, training opportunities and ensuring a viable technological competence level before organising human workers in teams with robots are important. Finally, we found that one of the toughest challenges for HRM relates to performance evaluation in teams where both humans and AI (including robots) work side by side. We referred to the lack of existing frameworks to guide HRM managers in this concern and stressed the possibility of taking insights from the computer gaming literature, where performance evaluation models have been developed to analyse humans and AI interactions while keeping the context and limitations of both in view.
Originality/value
Our paper is one of the few studies that go beyond a rather general or functional analysis of AI in the HRM context. It specifically focusses on the teamwork dimension, where human workers and AI-powered machines (robots) work together and offer insights and suggestions for such teams' smooth functioning.","AI","University of Manchester"

To date, mutations in the gene encoding amelogenin have been shown to underlie a subset of the X-linked recessive forms of AI. Although none of the genes underlying autosomal-dominant or autosomal-recessive AI have been identified, a locus for a local hypoplastic form has been mapped to human chromosome 4q11-q21. In the current investigation, we have analysed a family with an autosomal-dominant, smooth hypoplastic form of AI. Our results have shown that a splicing mutation in the splice donor site of intron 7 of the gene encoding the enamel-specific protein enamelin underlies the phenotype observed in this family. This is the first autosomal-dominant form of AI for which the genetic mutation has been identified. As this type of AI is clinically distinct from that localized previously to chromosome 4q11-q21, these findings highlight the need for a molecular classification of this group of disorders.","AI","University of Manchester"

Forty-two patients with proven squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix were treated by radiation alone. Apoptosis was measured by light microscopic observation of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from biopsies taken before treatment and 4 and 24 hr after 2 Gy. Patients were evaluated at the end of the external radiation for determination of short-term response and for long-term outcome as well (median follow-up of 27 months). Patients with high spontaneous AI showed poor short-term response, local control, and survival. The significance of AI as a predictor of short-term response was lost after allowing for differences in tumor size. The positive predictive value of AI for local control and survival was independent of tumor size and stage. High AI was associated with poor local control and long-term prognosis in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. The in vivo radiation-induced AI after 4 or 24 hr did not predict radiation therapy outcome. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","AI","University of Manchester"

L.","Oct 1995","Apoptosis is an important mechanism of cell death in tumours and it is seen both prior to and following radiotherapy. In this study patients with proven carcinoma of the cervix had measurement made of the percentage of apoptotic cells (apoptotic index or AI) in pre-therapy biopsies. Measurements of intrinsic radiosensitivity (SF2), already shown to be a predictor of outcome, had previously been made on the same pre-therapy biopsies. Mitotic index (MI) and Ki-67 antigen staining were also recorded as markers for proliferation. Patients were divided into those with an AI above or below the median and in general increasing apoptosis was associated with poor prognosis. The 5-year survival rate for tumours with an AI below the median was 79% and was significantly greater than the rate of 47% for those with an AI above the median (p = 0.003). There was also a significantly increased 5-year local recurrence-free rate for patients with an AI below the median compared with those with an AI above the median (79 versus 61%, p = 0.012). In addition, AI and SF2 acted as independent prognostic indicators. Patients with both an SF2 and AI value above the median did badly (25% 5-year survival, 46% local control) compared with those with an SF2 and AI below the median (80% 5-year survival, 100% local control). Apoptosis showed correlation with MI (n = 66, r = 0.34, p = 0.002) and cell staining for the Ki-67 antigen (n = 57, r = 0.25, p = 0.03), but neither MI nor Ki-67 were related to patient outcome. This suggests that while apoptosis may be a reflection of tumour proliferation this cannot in itself explain the ability of apoptosis to predict clinical outcome for this series of patients. The study raises the possibility of AI and SF2 being used together as predictors of tumour response to radiotherapy. © 1995.","AI","University of Manchester"

In order to facilitate rapid and accurate processing of samples, we have adapted the approach to allow use of TaqMan™ real-time quantitative PCR. We demonstrate that the approach represents a major improvement over existing conventional and real-time quantitative PCR approaches, since it can be applied to samples equivalent to a single cell, is able to accurately measure expression levels equivalent to less than l/100th copy/cell (one specific cDNA molecule present amongst 10 8 total cDNA molecules).

It is argued here that the trial offers a prism through which to explore wider anxieties that the generation who fought the Second World War held during the late 1960s. It maps how contemporary generational tensions, fears of national decline, and concerns about distorted cultural representations of war in Britain were embedded into the trial. This libel case thus became invested with considerable cultural significance among an ageing community of wartime survivors who were intent upon safeguarding wider memories of ‘their’ war.","Navy","University of Manchester"

In particular, historians have overlooked the division between the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. Yet portrayals of the two navies differed widely. Maritime films both during and after the war followed a well-established tradition of representing the navy as a force of disciplined and respectable men led by gentlemen heroes that reliably defended nation and empire. Such representations rarely acknowledged the existence of the Merchant Navy with its globally recruited and racially mixed workforce and its troubling associations with indiscipline. Yet naval operations largely concerned its protection, and the British war effort depended on the goods it transported. In the context of the leftward drift of wartime politics, the Merchant Navy received rare attention in a 1943 film that nevertheless avoided depicting non-white merchant seaman or disturbing the gender division. After the war the focus of maritime films returned to the Royal Navy. The liminal presence of the Merchant Navy in films of the 1950s was, however, significant. It was, variously, the vector for the expression of British insecurities about the wartime victory, the occasion for the portrayal of the enemy as an honourable foe, and a means to both romanticize, and hint at the fragility of, imperial masculinity. © The Author [2011].

From 1592 to 1598, the Chosŏn dynasty suffered invasions from Japan that displaced much of the Korean population and devastated the economy and environment. The crucial role of the navy during the war, along with a dire postwar situation, heightened government anxieties about deforestation and timber scarcity. Thus, in the seventeenth century, the Chosŏn government expanded administration over forests, particularly pine forests, across the coasts and islands of southwestern Korea. The key vehicle for the expansion was the military. Due to wartime and postwar exigencies, the military became the late Chosŏn state’s primary organ for management of wood resources for state purposes. Furthermore, the growth of pine-centric state forests and shifts in military priorities would significantly reshape Korean ecologies.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Did popular nationalism influence the PRC’s military escalation? A lack of transparency in elite Chinese decision-making puts a definitive answer to this question beyond our reach. However, this article utilizes qualitative and quantitative analyses of anti-Japanese discourse and deeds in both cyberspace and on the streets of urban China to argue that the circumstantial evidence is compelling: nationalist opinion is a powerful driver of China’s Japan policy. The demands of nationalist legitimation appear to pressure the elite to respond to popular nationalism. Should one or more Chinese die at the hands of the Japanese navy or air force, therefore, the popular pressure for escalation and war will likely be more than China’s leaders can manage.","Navy","University of Manchester"

The present work studies the combination of the Hilbert-Huang transform with the continuous wavelet transform, as data analysis methods that operate in time as well as in frequency, for the identification of localized corrosion. Additionally it incorporates fast Fourier transform as a technique to determine the distribution of power over frequency. Finally, it integrates the study of transient shape into the analysis of (time-) frequency properties. It is shown that the maxima in instantaneous frequency amplitudes of transients with otherwise different shapes can be similar. In the case of the presence of multiple transients in the EN signal, the cut-off frequency obtained from power spectral density plots is related to maxima in instantaneous frequency amplitudes of only a limited number of transients.","Navy","University of Manchester"

One class of methods examine the frequency content of the noise signal. The first such method to be used was conventional spectral analysis, initially using the Fourier Transform, and subsequently the Maximum Entropy Method. Apart from questions over the relative merits of the two methods, the estimation of the power spectrum suffers from the formal requirement that the signal being analysed is stationary, since corrosion processes are frequently non-stationary. This has lead to the use of alternative analysis methods that do not require the signal to be stationary, including wavelet analysis and, more recently, the Hilbert-Huang transform.

This paper argues that the literature on high reliability organizing, which emerged through studying day-to-day operations in the nuclear industry, air traffic control and US navy aircraft carriers, might hold important lessons for how the project management community can approach the management of safety-critical projects - projects in which safety is of paramount importance. Its aim is to consider how high-reliability organizing might be realised in these safety-critical projects.","Navy","University of Manchester"
"Oceanic seismotectonics from regional earthquake recordings: the 4-5˚N Mid-Atlantic Ridge","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/oceanic-seismotectonics-from-regional-earthquake-recordings-the-4","de Melo, G. W. S.; Mitchell, N.; Zahradnik, J.; Dias, F.; do Nascimento, A. F.","20 Nov 2021","Uncertainties in epicentral locations and hypocentral depths often prevent earthquakes from being associated with individual or group of faults in bathymetric data, thus limiting the understanding of tectonic behavior. Ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) can overcome this problem, but they take significant efforts to build and deploy, so information from them covers only a minor part of the earthquake record of mid-ocean ridges. As an alternative, a combination of records from seismometers at regional distances and appropriate processing methods can yield location and depth estimates that are useful because they provide extensive data. We illustrate this with a study of magnitude of the seismicity in the 4–5°N Mid-Atlantic Ridge using data from seismometers in Brazil, Cape Verdes, and Africa coast. The seismicity occurred in swarms in 2012 (seven events), 2014 (five events), 2016 (62 events), and 2019 (eight events). We compare the seismicity with features using bathymetric data collected with a multibeam sonars, which reveal two detachment fault surfaces (“megamullions”), one close to the modern rift valley floor but offset by ~10 km from it. The located seismicity is shallow (best estimate less than 8 km below seafloor). The swarms occurred over two segments of the ridge and, in the 2016 case, clearly involved movements on widely distributed multiple faults, including faults on both sides of the valley. Although the methods used produce epicenters and hypocenters with uncertainties that are still larger than those of OBS experiments, they could provide a way to study whether seismicity is systematically deep in certain parts of the ridge where megamullions are observed.","Navy","University of Manchester"

One of the towering figures of this epoch is W.V. Quine (1908-2000), champion of naturalism in philosophy of science, pioneer of mathematical logic, trying to unite an austerely physicalist theory of the world with the truths of mathematics, psychology, and linguistics. Quine's posthumous papers, notes, and drafts revealing the development of his views in the forties have recently begun to be published, as well as careful philosophical studies of, for instance, the evolution of his key doctrine that mathematical and logical truth are continuous with, not divorced from, the truths of natural science. But one central text has remained unexplored: Quine's Portuguese-language book on logic, his 'farewell for now' to the discipline as he embarked on an assignment in the Navy in WWII. Anglophone philosophers have neglected this book because they could not read it. Jointly with colleagues, I have completed the first full English translation of this book. In this accompanying paper I  draw out the main philosophical contributions Quine made in the book, placing them in their historical context and relating them to Quine's overall philosophical development during the period. Besides significant developments in the evolution of Quine's views on meaning and analyticity, I argue, this book is also driven by Quine's indebtedness to Russell and Whitehead, Tarski, and Frege, and contains crucial developments in his thinking on philosophy of logic and ontology. This includes early versions of some arguments from 'On What There Is', four-dimensionalism, and virtual set theory.","Navy","University of Manchester"

This article draws on a concept of popular memory that suggests that rival versions of the past compete for cultural centrality, to ask how Dunkirk acquired this position. During the war, accounts stressed the importance of the sea in the 'deliverance', but while some focused on the Navy, others concentrated on the civilian small boats, and criticism was rare. Immediately postwar there was a lull in representations. In the 1950s, attention switched to the land and to the problematic place of the defeated Army in the story, culminating in Ealing Studios' film Dunkirk (1958). Ealing attempted to synthesize previous emphases and struggled to achieve agreement about the representation of the evacuation. The film ensured the public prominence of the memory of Dunkirk, yet its reception was fractured along class and gender lines, indicating the instabilities of Ealing's negotiated consensus. The history of the contested inscription of Dunkirk in British culture emphasizes that at no point since the events occurred has the representation of the second world war been secure; the popular memory of the war is continually subject to construction, contestation and revision. © 2010 The Author.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Shifts in ownership from the state to private hands or pious foundations put further stress on the state’s traditional fiscal base. Christ argues that the sultans increased taxation and state intervention in response, and thus that control of the international transit trade turned out to be particularly profitable. In order to tap it more effectively, the Mamluk sultanate reinforced ties with the Venetians in the Mediterranean and the Rasulids in the Red Sea. Relations were grounded in an ambiguous language of gift exchange which allowed for the harmonization of nominal hierarchical difference and de facto bilateral, symbiotic exchange. On the basis of shared trade interests, the Mamluks delegated power over the ‘Two Seas’. This delegation was not perfect though; the Mamluks also sought to establish a direct if only seasonal fiscal presence in the Egyptian gateways of this trade in Alexandria, Upper Egypt and the Hijaz , thus combining delegation on the seas with tighter control in the ports in order to channel the lucrative transit trade through their Cairo power base.","Navy","University of Manchester"

We used two analysis techniques with independent estimates of the noise mmodels for the pulsar observations and different algorithms for obtaining the pulsar timescale. The two analyses agree within the estimated uncertainties and both agree with TT(BIPM17), a post-corrected timescale produced by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). We show that both methods could detect significant errors in TT(BIPM17) if they were present. We estimate the stability of the atomic clocks from which TT(BIPM17) is derived using observations of four rubidium fountain clocks at the US Naval Observatory. Comparing the power spectrum of TT(IPTA16) with that of these fountain clocks suggests that pulsar-based timescales are unlikely to contribute to the stability of the best timescales over the next decade, but they will remain a valuable independent check on atomic timescales. We also find that the stability of the pulsar-based timescale is likely to be limited by our knowledge of solar-system dynamics, and that errors in TT(BIPM17) will not be a limiting factor for the primary goal of the IPTA, which is to search for the signatures of nano-Hertz gravitational waves.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Ground-based measurements are from the CalNex Pasadena ground site, and airborne measurements took place onboard the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Navy Twin Otter and the NOAA WP-3D aircraft. BC predictions are in general agreement with observations at the Pasadena ground site and onboard the WP-3D, but are consistently overpredicted when compared to Twin Otter measurements. Adjustments to predicted inorganic mass concentrations, based on predicted aerosol size distributions and the AMS transmission efficiency, are shown to be significant. Owing to recent shipping emission reductions, the dominant source of sulfate in the L.A. Basin may now be long-range transport. Sensitivity studies suggest that severely underestimated ammonia emissions, and not the exclusion of crustal species (Ca2 +, K+, and Mg2 +), are the single largest contributor to measurement/model disagreement in the eastern part of the L.A. Basin. Despite overstated NOx emissions, total nitrate concentrations are underpredicted, which suggests a missing source of HNO 3 and/or overprediction of deposition rates. Adding gas-phase NH 3 measurements and size-resolved measurements, up to 10 μm, of nitrate and various cations (e.g. Na+, Ca2 +, K +) to routine monitoring stations in the L.A.

R.; Volt, F.; Wynn, R.; Lee, S. J.; Horowitz, M. M.; Gluckman, E.; Ruggeri, A.","Jul 2017","Background The standard for selecting unrelated umbilical cord blood units for transplantation for non-malignant diseases relies on antigen-level (lower resolution) HLA typing for HLA-A and HLA-B, and allele-level for HLA-DRB1. We aimed to study the effects of allele-level matching at a higher resolution—HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1, which is the standard used for adult unrelated volunteer donor transplantation for non-malignant diseases—for umbilical cord blood transplantation. Methods We retrospectively studied 1199 paediatric donor-recipient pairs with allele-level HLA matching who received a single unit umbilical cord blood transplantation for non-malignant diseases reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research or Eurocord and European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant. Transplantations occurred between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2012. The primary outcome was overall survival. The effect of HLA matching on survival was studied using a Cox regression model. Findings Compared with HLA-matched transplantations, mortality was higher with transplantations mismatched at two (hazard ratio [HR] 1·55, 95% CI 1·08–2·21, p=0·018), three (2·04, 1·44–2·89, p=0·0001), and four or more alleles (3·15, 2·16–4·58, p<0·0001). There were no significant differences in mortality between transplantations that were matched and mismatched at one allele (HR 1·18, 95% CI 0·80–1·72, p=0·39). Other factors associated with higher mortality included recipient cytomegalovirus seropositivity (HR 1·40, 95% CI 1·13–1·74, p=0·0020), reduced intensity compared with myeloablative conditioning regimens (HR 1·36, 1·10–1·68, p=0·0041), transplantation of units with total nucleated cell dose of more than 21 × 107 cells per kg compared with 21 × 107 cells per kg or less (HR 1·47, 1·11–1·95, p=0·0076), and transplantations done in 2000–05 compared with those done in 2006–12 (HR 1·64, 1·31–2·04, p<0·0001). The 5-year overall survival adjusted for recipient cytomegalovirus serostatus, conditioning regimen intensity, total nucleated cell dose, and transplantation period was 79% (95% CI 74–85) after HLA matched, 76% (71–81) after one allele mismatched, 70% (65–75) after two alleles mismatched, 62% (57–68) after three alleles mismatched, and 49% (41–57) after four or more alleles mismatched transplantations. Graft failure was the predominant cause of mortality. Interpretation These data support a change from current practice in that selection of unrelated umbilical cord blood units for transplantation for non-malignant diseases should consider allele-level HLA matching at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1.

The enactment of the National Defence Policy resulted in an increase in defence expenditure in Brazil that was primarily focused on developing and buying modern equipment and paying better salaries. The policy was implemented during three investment cycles that began with off-the-shelf acquisitions and moved to the execution of defence programmes aiming to develop indigenous technologies, substituting imports on the way. Despite the effort, we argue that the most likely scenario is that the achievement of the vision established in the National Defence Policy will be compromised, and that constant delays caused by the expenditure constraints might result in the delivery of outdated technologies and weapon systems, keeping a never-ending technological gap.","Navy","University of Manchester"

This paper uses the method of risk analysis to discuss defence procurement challenges in India. An original dataset of 88 contracts has been created to identify the most probable and the most severe causes for poor procurement performance. A schedule performance parameter has been constructed to quantify the impact of different adverse events. The findings display a high probability of technological risks followed by contractual risks as the cause for delays in Indian defence procurement. Technological risks are concentrated in cases of indigenous procurement, due to a lack of infrastructure and resources, while contractual risks mostly occur in contracts where the Ministry of Defence deals with external agents like foreign suppliers. This indicates frictions and transaction costs. These and other findings from the quantitative data on procurement performance are supplemented by insights from an extensive fieldwork in India which included 53 interviews.","Navy","University of Manchester"

It suspended the convertibility of the Bank of England's notes into gold, a policy that lasted until 1821. The current historical consensus is that it was a result of the state's need to finance the war, France’s remonetization, a loss of confidence in the English country banks, and a run on the Bank of England’s reserves following a landing of French troops in Wales. We argue that while these factors help us understand the timing of the suspension, they cannot explain its success. We deploy new long-term data that leads us to a complementary explanation: the policy succeeded thanks to the reputation of the Bank of England, achieved through a century of prudential collaboration between the Bank and the Treasury.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Once the final colour is chosen, most of the problems associated with delivering the colour selected, under precise colour definition and control, at a reasonable cost, have been solved. Technical colour management is well served by accurate measurement and colour manipulation tools, and is founded on tried and tested science. By contrast, those managers whose responsibility it is to deliver successful colour selection, cannot appeal to much more than general principles, the dictates of fashion and intuition: they have very few tools and measurement techniques to assist them. Colour influences all aspects of our lives, from the clothes we wear and the food we eat to the environment in which we work [2]. The colour of an item of apparel worn by someone has an impact on how they are perceived by others and how they perceive themselves. This means that consumers are extremely sensitive to colour when choosing apparel goods. The rapid development of computers and information processing technology offers the prospect of bringing together hitherto fragmentary knowledge and precision colour technology in a concerted effort to improve the process of optimising product colour.

S.","15 Jul 2019","Between 1500 and 1800 CE, patterns of governance on the Korean peninsula shifted toward a dynamic that I term the “rise of the brokered state.” While central political authority increasingly became entrenched in a small number of elite families residing in the capital region, the reach of the Chosŏn state continued to grow through local institutions such as clerks and military garrisons. Likewise, avenues of interaction between Seoul and the provinces broadened thanks to the social and organizational consolidation of local elites. Over time, the government was able to utilize a widening assemblage of bureaucratic administration and local cooperation to expand state management of resources such as grain and timber. Previous scholarship has often situated Chosŏn center-local dynamics within vectors of conflict, stagnation, or progress. My analysis reframes Chosŏn administrative expansion as an interactive process through which a wide array of local yangban, clerks, military officials, and monks became key intermediaries between the central government and the provinces, in turn forming the infrastructural contours of the Chosŏn state itself.","Navy","University of Manchester"

The two-stage cascade allows for increased separation selectivity whilst the integrated solvent recovery stage mitigates the otherwise large solvent consumption of the purification. This work explores the effect of washing the solvent recovery unit at intervals in order to attain high product purities with imperfect solvent recovery membranes possessing less than 100% rejection of the impurity. This operation attains a purity of 98.7% through semi-continuous operation with two washes of the solvent recovery stage, even when imperfect membranes are used in a closed-loop set-up. This contrasts favourably with the 83.0% maximum purity achievable in a similar set-up with a single continuous run. The process achieves slightly lower (−0.7%) yield of around 98.2% compared to a continuously operated process without solvent recovery but consumes approx. 85% less solvent (theoretical analysis suggests up to 96% reduction is possible). 9 different membranes, both commercial (GMT, Novamem, SolSep) and in-house fabricated, are screened and tested on a separation challenge associated with the synthesis of macrocycles – amongst the membrane materials are polyimide (PI), polybenzimidazole (PBI) and, polyetheretherketone (PEEK).","Navy","University of Manchester"

L.; Hodgson, D. M.; Brunt, R. L.; Peakall, J.; Hofstra, M.; Flint, S. S.","2018","Submarine channel-lobe transition zones separate well-defined channels from welldefined lobes and form morphologically complicated areas, commonly located at breaks in slope. These areas play a vital role in the transfer of sediment through deep-water systems. Extensive outcrop exposures in the Karoo Basin, South Africa, permit investigation of the depositional architecture and evolution of entirely exhumed dip transects of a channel-lobe transition zone for the first time. Furthermore, the excellent paleogeographic constraint allows correlation to genetically related updip channel-levee systems and downdip lobe deposits over 40 km, with strike control over 20 km. Unlike the single time slice afforded by modern systems, the Karoo example uniquely allows study of the temporal shifting of the channel-lobe transition zone and transfer into the stratigraphic record. Key lateral changes along the base of slope include the variation from an interfingering levee-lobe transition zone to a bypass-dominated channel-lobe transition zone over a width of 14 km. Key recognition criteria for channel-lobe transition zones in the ancient record include combinations of scours and megaflutes, composite erosional surfaces, mudstone clast/coarse-grained sediment lags, and remnants of depositional bed forms, such as sediment waves. Documented here in a single channel-lobe transition zone, these features are arranged in a zone of juxtaposed remnant erosional and depositional features. The zone reaches 6 km in length, formed by at least four stages of expansion/contraction or migration. Strike variations and changes in the dimensions of the channel-lobe transition zone through time are interpreted to be the result of physiographic changes and variations in flow dynamics across the base of slope. The dynamic nature of channellobe transition zones results in complicated and composite stratigraphy, with preservation potential generally low but increasing distally and laterally away from the mouth of the feeder channel system. Here, we present the first generic model to account for dynamic channel-lobe transition zone development, encompassing distinctive recognition criteria, fluctuations in the morphology and position of the zone, and the complex transfer into the sedimentary record.","Navy","University of Manchester"

In recent years, research on the United Kingdom's population has placed greater emphasis on population movement in shaping Britain's story, identifying waves of migrants from elsewhere alongside migration within Britain. One neglected aspect of this narrative, however, is the migration of Scots to England, particularly in the age of the regal and parliamentary union, when the changing political relationship between the two kingdoms had an impact on the scale, geographic spread, and opportunities and obstacles of that migration. While a minority of Scottish migrants were unwelcome, or chose to return home, the overwhelming weight of evidence is for those migrants who remained in England. The focus in this article is on that majority group for whom migration was a positive experience, thus raising questions about why these Scots were so successful and why they faced so little native opposition. That process of segmented assimilation offers an insight into the formation of Britain and the shifting ground of national identity associated with the emerging British state. The Scots, moreover, provide a model for “successful” migration, suggesting that a range of factors—principally, an educated, culturally malleable, and economically responsive migrant population, alongside an institutionally and attitudinally flexible host community—need to be in place in order to optimize the chances of migrant assimilation","Navy","University of Manchester"

However, SRS, as a supremum, is over-conservative and cannot fully describe the relative severity for various shock environments. This study introduces shock response matrix, from which shock severity infimum (SSI) can be extracted using singular value decomposition method. Based on SRS and SSI, dual spectra are introduced to determine the range of shock severity between its supremum and infimum. The evaluation of the relative severity of various shock signals is discussed and validated by finite element simulations.","Navy","University of Manchester"

The paper draws on data from interviews with UK born adults with parents who had been refugees from Vietnam, Sri Lanka (Tamils) and Kurds from Turkey. While some parents shared pre-migration, flight and post-migration stories others chose not to talk about the past. There were clear differences between the three heritage groups that related to the displacement contexts and to responses to loss and trauma. Both the stories told and the gaps and silences were made sense of and filtered, by the second generation, through the lens of their lives in the UK. The second generation developed their own narratives of their parent’s pasts, which were embedded in their everyday lives but also framed around their distinctive heritages.

"“Grateful” Children and “Humanitarian” Marines: Georgette “Dickey” Chapelle’s Vietnam Photography, 1962","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/grateful-children-and-humanitarian-marines-georgette-dickey-chape","Vesma, G.","5 Jul 2021","This article explores how one female photographer, Georgette ‘Dickey’ Chapelle (1918–1965), used children’s emotions as visual and rhetorical justification for early ‘advisory’ actions in Vietnam by the United States, situating the presence of U.S. Marines in Vietnam as ‘humanitarian’. Children are a common subject for ‘humanitarian photography’, mobilising an emotional response and justifying certain actions as humanitarian (Fehrenbach and Rodogno, Humanitarian Photography: A History. Cambridge University Press, 2015). War photography studies have explored the creation of a ‘humanitarian soldier' to justify colonising conflicts in the twenty-first century (Parry, Media, Culture and Society 33 (8): 1185–1201, 2011; Kotilainen, “Humanitarian Soldiers, Colonialised Others and Invisible Enemies-Visual Strategic Communication Narratives of the Afghan War.” FIIA Working Paper, 2011). This paper brings these ideas to a case study from the Vietnam War era, emphasising the role of emotional constructions in the production of such ‘humanitarian’ interpretations of military activity. In her article for National Geographic, “Helicopter War in Viet Nam,” Chapelle focused on interactions between uniformed American men and Vietnamese children, whom she portrayed as grateful recipients of airlifts, clothing and medical treatment. Chapelle used children to symbolise South Vietnam, reflecting political discourses in the United States that presented Vietnam as a ‘childlike’ nation in need of ‘rescue’. While many photographs of children from the Vietnam War era were used as evidence of the moral indefensibility of the conflict, this paper argues that Chapelle’s photographs from the Mekong Delta in 1962 portray Vietnam as ‘childlike’ to justify American intervention in Vietnam as ‘humanitarian’.","Navy","University of Manchester"

This paper explores the contested yet symbiotic relationship of management and the military, via a discussion of the Vietnam conflict and contemporary debates over restructuring the U.S. military to fight so-called ‘New Wars’. It portrays a complex picture of the organization and measurement of destruction, arguing that managerialism has long been an important ideological element of civilian and military practice. While management systems such as the infamous ‘measurements of progress’ in the Vietnam War were practically dysfunctional they were effective up to a point in their managerialist goal of portraying civilian and military organizations as effective, evidence-based, progressive and ethical. This logic also pertains to contemporary debates over ‘progress’ and its measurement in the Iraq and Afghanistan counterinsurgencies and the campaign against Isil. Despite its practical limitations, managerialism is highly prevalent as ideology in warfare, fixating on tactical and operational levels thereby excluding broader strategic, political or ethical discussions. ‘Progress’ and its mismeasurement in Vietnam and the New Wars are therefore best understood not simply as reasons for military and civilian failures in prolonged and inconclusive conflicts, but as evidence of the success of managerialism in restricting public scrutiny and accountability of the business of war.","Navy","University of Manchester"

A.; Durkan, C.","2019","Fouling of oil-exposed surfaces remains a crucial issue due to the continued importance of oil as the world’s primary energy source. The key perpetrators in crude oil fouling have been identified as asphaltenes, a poorly-described mixture of diverse polyfunctional molecules that form part of the heaviest fractions of oil. Asphaltenes are responsible for a decrease in oil production and energy efficiency, and an increase in the risk of environmental hazards. Hence, understanding and managing systems that are prone to fouling is of great value but constitutes a challenge due to their complexity. In an effort to reduce that complexity, a study of a synthesised foulant of archipelago structure is presented. An alternative perspective on previously described solubility and aggregation mechanisms (eg. Critical Nanoaggrerate Concentration, Critical Clustering Concentration) is offered since the characterised system favours a continuous distribution of n-mers instead. A battery of experimental and modelling techniques have been employed to link the bulk and interfacial behaviour of a representative foulant monomer to effective fouling mitigation strategies. This systematic approach defines a new multiscale methodology in the investigation of fouling systems.","Navy","University of Manchester"

The ability to recognize and classify activities can help in the objective monitoring of health and wellness trends in ageing adults. While the use of video and stereo cameras for monitoring activities provides an adequate insight, the privacy of users is not fully protected (i.e., users can easily be recognized from the images). Another concern is that widely used wearable sensors, such as accelerometers, have some disadvantages, such as limited battery life, adoption issues and wearability. This study investigates the use of low-cost thermal sensing solutions capable of generating distinct thermal blobs with timestamps to recognize the activities of study participants. More than 11,000 thermal blobs were recorded from 10 healthy participants with two thermal sensors placed in a laboratory kitchen: (i) one mounted on the ceiling, and (ii) the other positioned on a mini tripod stand in the corner of the room. Furthermore, data from the ceiling thermal sensor were fused with data gleaned from the lateral thermal sensor. Contact sensors were used at each stage as the gold standard for timestamp approximation during data acquisition, which allowed the attainment of: (i) the time at which each activity took place, (ii) the type of activity performed, and (iii) the location of each participant. Experimental results demonstrated successful cluster-based activity recognition and classification with an average regression co-efficient of 0.95 for tested clusters and features. Also, an average accuracy of 95% was obtained for data mining models such as k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, neural network and random forest on Evaluation Test.Clinical Relevance-This study presents an unobtrusive (i.e., privacy-friendly) solution for activity recognition and classification, for the purposes of profiling trends in health and wellbeing.","Navy","University of Manchester"

This relationship encompasses the Ministry of Defence (MoD), a monopsonist, partnering with a monopolistic defense industry. The transition from an oligopolistic to monopolistic defense industry is the result of a number of government policies that have created a consolidated defense industrial base. Defense industry relationships have historically been adversarial, making defense acquisition in the past inefficient. We identify Integrated Project Teams (IPTs) as being central to the institutional level aims of creating a collaborative industrial relation. IPTs characterize relational contracting practices at the governance level, which demands communication, collaboration, and trust. However, difficulties at the process level in utilizing relational contracting because of a lack of definition, communication, and mutual gain within the day-to-day business of the IPT limit the benefits of this approach. This failure to create an effective partnership between the MoD and its prime contractors highlights the major challenge facing the UK defense sector in its transition towards capability acquisition, such as Network Enabled Capability (NEC). NEC demands a more collaborative, through-life approach to defense acquisition.","Navy","University of Manchester"
"The stability of a flexible cantilever in viscous channel flow","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/the-stability-of-a-flexible-cantilever-in-viscous-channel-flow","Cisonni, J.; Lucey, A.; Elliott, N.; Heil, M.","2017","Most studies of the flow-induced flutter instability of a flexible cantilever have assumed inviscid flow because of the high flow speeds and the large scale of the structures encountered in the wide range of applications of this fluid–structure interaction (FSI) system. However, for instance, in the fields of energy harvesting and biomechanics, low flow speeds and small- and micro-scale systems can give relatively low Reynolds numbers so that fluid viscosity needs to be explicitly accounted for to provide reliable predictions of channel-immersed-cantilever stability. In this study, we employ a numerical model coupling the Navier–Stokes equations and a one-dimensional elastic beam model. We conduct a parametric investigation to determine the conditions leading to flutter instability of a slender flexible cantilever immersed in two-dimensional viscous channel flow for Reynolds numbers lower than 1000. The large set of numerical simulations carried out allows predictions of the influence of decreasing Reynolds numbers and of the cantilever confinement on the single-mode neutral stability of the FSI system and on the pre- and post-critical cantilever motion. This model's predictions are also compared to those of a FSI model containing a two-dimensional solid model in order to assess, primarily, the effect of the cantilever slenderness in the simulations. Results show that an increasing contribution of viscosity to the hydrodynamic forces significantly alters the instability boundaries. In general, a decrease in Reynolds number is predicted to produce a stabilisation of the FSI system, which is more pronounced for high fluid-to-solid mass ratios. For particular fluid-to-solid mass ratios, viscous effects can lower the critical velocity and lead to a change in the first unstable structural mode. However, at constant Reynolds number, the effects of viscosity on the system stability are diminished by the confinement of the cantilever, which strengthens the importance of flow inertia.","Navy","University of Manchester"

The purpose of this paper is to study the nature of gait variability in more detail, by identifying gait intervals responsible for gait pattern variations in individuals, as well as between individuals, using cognitive demanding tasks. This work uses deep learning methods for sensor fusion of 116 plastic optical fiber (POF) distributed sensors for gait recognition. The floor sensor system captures spatiotemporal samples due to varying ground reaction force (GRF) in multiples of up to 4 uninterrupted steps on a continuous 2x1 m area. We demonstrate classifications of gait signatures, achieving up to 100% F1-score with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), in the context of gait recognition of 21 subjects, with imposters and clients. Classifications under cognitive load, induced by 4 different dual tasks, manifested lower F1-scores. Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) methods are employed to decompose a trained neural network prediction to relevant standard events in the gait cycle, by generating a “heat map” over the input used for classification. This allows valuable insight into which parts of the gait spatiotemporal signal have the heaviest influence on the gait classification and consequently, which gait events, such as heel strike or toe-off, are mostly affected by cognitive load.","Navy","University of Manchester"

This study examines the relation between occupational RF and intermediate frequency (IF) EMF exposure and brain tumor (glioma and meningioma) risk in the INTEROCC multinational population-based case-control study (with nearly 4000 cases and over 5000 controls), using a novel exposure assessment approach.METHODS: Individual indices of cumulative exposure to RF and IF-EMF (overall and in specific exposure time windows) were assigned to study participants using a source-exposure matrix and detailed interview data on work with or nearby EMF sources. Conditional logistic regression was used to investigate associations with glioma and meningioma risk.RESULTS: Overall, around 10% of study participants were exposed to RF while only 1% were exposed to IF-EMF. There was no clear evidence for a positive association between RF or IF-EMF and the brain tumors studied, with most results showing either no association or odds ratios (ORs) below 1.0. The largest adjusted ORs were obtained for cumulative exposure to RF magnetic fields (as A/m-years) in the highest exposed category (≥90th percentile) for the most recent exposure time window (1-4 years before the diagnosis or reference date) for both glioma, OR = 1.62 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 3.01) and meningioma (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 0.65, 3.55).CONCLUSION: Despite the improved exposure assessment approach used in this study, no clear associations were identified. However, the results obtained for recent exposure to RF electric and magnetic fields are suggestive of a potential role in brain tumor promotion/progression and should be further investigated.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Nitrogen purged polymerizations (100 - 160 C) were quenched after a monitored increase in viscosity. A combination of multiple detector SEC, NMR, MALDI TOF, DLS and elemental analysis was used to elucidate significant structural differences (cyclic, branched, tadpole, extended and network topologies) in the polymers produced under different conditions. A significant proportion of the apparent surface area (up to 200 m2 g-1) associated with PIM-1 can be attributable to whether its contorted polymer chains in fact link to form cyclic or other non-linear structures.

High levels of alcohol misuse and pre-service adversity were found. There were significant differences between offence types: violent offenders were more likely than sexual or other offenders to have offended before service. Findings suggest interventions should focus on violent behaviour and alcohol misuse.","Navy","University of Manchester"

S.; Guinea, F.; Geim, A.; Fal'ko, V.; Mishchenko, A.","25 Feb 2019","The quantum Hall effect (QHE) originates from discrete Landau levels forming in a two-dimensional electron system in a magnetic field1. In three dimensions, the QHE is forbidden because the third dimension spreads Landau levels into overlapping bands, destroying the quantisation. Here we report the QHE in graphite crystals that are up to hundreds of atomic layers thick, a thickness at which graphite was believed to behave as a normal, bulk semimetal2. We attribute this observation to a dimensional reduction of electron dynamics in high magnetic fields, such that the electron spectrum remains continuous only in the field direction, and only the last two quasi-one-dimensional Landau bands cross the Fermi level3,4. Under these conditions, the formation of standing waves in sufficiently thin graphite films leads to a discrete spectrum allowing the QHE. Despite the large thickness, we observe differences between crystals with even and odd numbers of graphene layers. Films with odd layer numbers show reduced QHE gaps, as compared to films of similar thicknesses but with even numbers because the latter retain the inversion symmetry characteristic of bilayer graphene5,6. We also observe clear signatures of electron-electron interactions including the fractional QHE below 0.5 K.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Here we report the direct observation and manipulation of chirality and pseudospin polarization in the tunneling of electrons between two almost perfectly aligned graphene crystals. We use a strong in-plane magnetic field as a tool to resolve the contributions of the chiral electronic states that have a phase difference between the two components of their vector wavefunction. Our experiments not only shed light on chirality, but also demonstrate a technique for preparing graphene's Dirac electrons in a particular quantum chiral state in a selected valley.","Navy","University of Manchester"

M.; Rea, S.; Marsden, J.; Green, A. C.","2018","BACKGROUND: Airline pilots and cabin crew are potentially exposed to hazardous ultraviolet (UV) and cosmic radiation that may increase their risk of melanoma and other skin cancers.OBJECTIVES: To establish precise risks of melanoma and keratinocyte cancer (KC) for airline pilots and for cabin crew based on all studies published to date.METHODS: We searched Medline, ISI science citation index, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and CINAHL to June 2018. All studies of melanoma and KC risk and mortality in airline pilots and cabin crew compared with the general population were eligible. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and mortality ratios (SMRs) were pooled using random effects models.RESULTS: From 5866 articles, we reviewed 44 full-text articles, of which 12 studies whose data were collected mostly between the 1970s-1990s, were eligible for inclusion. The pooled SIR (pSIR) for melanoma in pilots was 2·03 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1·71-2·40) and in cabin crew was 2·12 (95% CI 1·71-2·62). For pilots, pSMR for melanoma was 1·99 (95% CI 1·17-3·40) and for cabin crew was 1·18 (95% CI 0·73-1·89). For KC, the pSIR was 1·86 (95% CI 1·54-2·25) in pilots and 1·97 (95% CI 1·25-2·96) in cabin crew. There was no evidence of study heterogeneity.CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence shows that airline pilots and cabin crew have about twice the risk of melanoma and other skin cancers compared with the general population, with pilots more likely to die from melanoma. However, most of evidence was collected several decades ago and their relevance to contemporary levels of risk is uncertain. This article is protected by copyright.

This article argues that it is therefore unsurprising that the sea also impacted on copper workers in the southern Aegean during the Early Bronze Age. Here, the sea was an integral element of the copper production, which is characterized by movement of metal across the sea from one manufacturing stage to the next—often over considerable distances requiring lengthy absences of the workers from their home communities, making metalworkers true maritime specialists alongside the more “typical” traders, fishermen, and seafarers. The distances traveled magnified the symbolic value of the raw materials as the object’s geographic distance became converted into a symbolic value-added “exotic” distance. This value was further enhanced thanks to the mastery of skills required to traverse the sea, an element very different from land and intimately associated with forgetting, disposal, and death.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Thirty-nine (37%) had a mental health diagnosis recorded, most commonly for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and personality disorder. Those who screened for a CCMH problem were more likely to have pre-service vulnerability to negative health outcomes and those with dual symptomology were more likely to have experienced deployment during their service. Findings suggest the mental health needs of this group are similar to the general prison population.

By analysing the support that the institute’s director, Denis Saurat, brought to Charles de Gaulle in the early days of Free France, the article contributes to our understanding of the formation of Free French political thought. This study analyses Saurat’s shifting position in the movement, from being Gaullist to becoming an active partisan of anti-Gaullism. The examination of Saurat’s networks and politics helps to re-appraise further trends of anti-Gaullism caused by leftist views not least regarding the lack of democratic principles that characterized Free France in 1940–2. Finally, Saurat’s anti-Gaullism was also prompted by his refusal to put the French cultural institute in London at the service of de Gaulle and support Free French propagandist, cultural and academic ambitions in the world. Overall this article argues for a reassessment of London-based leftist anti-Gaullism understood not just through issues of personalities and democracy but also through the prism of cultural diplomacy and propaganda.","Navy","University of Manchester"

C.","2019","OBJECTIVES: Occupational exposure to cosmic and ultraviolet radiation may increase airline pilots' risk of cutaneous melanoma. Meta-analyses of available data show a higher than average incidence of melanoma in airline pilots, but the most recent systematic review revealed that few contemporary data are available. Moreover, all relevant studies have been conducted in Northern Hemisphere populations. We therefore aimed to examine if Australian commercial pilots have a raised incidence of melanoma compared with the general population.METHODS: We examined all melanoma histologically diagnosed among Australian-licensed commercial pilots in the period 2011-2016 by manually reviewing de-identified data in the medical records system of the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority. We estimated age-specific incidence rates and compared these with corresponding population rates using standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) as measures of relative risk. Expected numbers were calculated by multiplying age- and calendar period-specific person-years (PYs) with corresponding rates from the entire Australian population; 95% CI were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution of the observed cases.RESULTS: In this cohort of Australian-licensed commercial pilots observed for 91 370 PYs, 114 developed a melanoma (51 invasive, 63 in situ). More than 50% of melanomas occurred on the trunk, and the predominant subtype was superficial spreading melanoma. The SIR for invasive melanoma was 1.20 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.55) and for melanoma in situ, 1.39 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.78).CONCLUSION: Australian-licensed commercial pilots have a modestly raised risk of in situ melanoma but no elevation of invasive melanoma compared with the general population.","Navy","University of Manchester"

We identified 25 new susceptibility loci, 3 of which contain integrin genes that encode proteins in pathways that have been identified as important therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and ICAM1). In all four cases, the expression-increasing allele also increases disease risk. We also identified likely causal missense variants in a gene implicated in primary immune deficiency, PLCG2, and a negative regulator of inflammation, SLAMF8. Our results demonstrate that new associations at common variants continue to identify genes relevant to therapeutic target identification and prioritization.","Navy","University of Manchester"

A.","10 Dec 2019","The Taiping War (1850–1864) destroyed tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands of religious sites across China. In the wake of the destruction, Buddhist and other religious leaders led reconstruction campaigns to rebuild temples and monasteries that had been destroyed. This article examines some general trends in the post-Taiping religious reconstruction, and looks at a few case studies of well-known Buddhist monasteries that were rebuilt in the years following the war. I argue that not only was the post-war reconstruction a lively and energetic process, but that it helped to shape Buddhist religious culture long after the first phase of reconstructions were completed. Reconstruction was not simply a return to the status quo ante bellum, but rather an opportunity to introduce change into what was normally a highly stable system.","Navy","University of Manchester"

I focus on two of his comics set in this meat-packing district: the series Un tal Daneri (1974–77), written by Carlos Trillo, and the short-story ‘El aire’ (1976), written by Guillermo Saccomanno. Created during a period of increasing political violence, I analyse how these works express the material practice of animal slaughter as well as the slaughterhouse’s potent political symbolism. In particular I argue that the highly material, embodied techniques that Breccia uses, including cuts with blades, paper tears and collage, present Mataderos as an assemblage where human, animal and non-human fuse together. They also remind us of the material labour processes that underpin both these images and the neighbourhood itself. As a result, I suggest, these works both suggest an alternative to the dichotomy of civilization and barbarism that has dominated the Argentine political and urban imaginary, and also demonstrate how artistic practice can be used to embody the materiality of marginal bodies and spaces.","Navy","University of Manchester"

T.; Hodgson, D. M.; Stevenson, C.; Flint, S.","13 Jan 2017","Seabed topography is ubiquitous across basin-floor environments, and influences sediment gravity flows and sediment dispersal patterns. The impact of steep (several degrees) confining slopes on sedimentary facies and depositional architecture has been widely documented. However, the influence of gentle (fraction of a degree) confining slopes is less well-documented, largely due to outcrop limitations. Here, exceptional outcrop and research borehole data from Unit A of the Permian Laingsburg Formation, South Africa, provide the means to examine the influence of subtle lateral confinement on flow behaviour and lobe stacking patterns. The dataset describes the detailed architecture of subunits A.1 to A.6, a succession of stacked lobe complexes, over a palinspastically restored 22 km across-strike transect. Facies distributions, stacking patterns, thickness and palaeoflow trends indicate the presence of a south-east facing low angle (fraction of a degree) lateral intrabasinal slope. Interaction between stratified turbidity currents with a thin basal sand-prone part and a thick mud-prone part and the confining slope results in facies transition from thick-bedded sandstones to thin-bedded heterolithic lobe fringe-type deposits. Slope angle dictates the distance over which the facies transition occurs (hundreds of metres to kilometres). These deposits are stacked vertically over tens of metres in successive lobe complexes to form an aggradational succession of lobe fringes. Extensive slides and debrites are present at the base of lobe complexes, and are associated with steeper restored slope gradients. The persistent facies transition across multiple lobe complexes, and the mass flow deposits, suggests that the intrabasinal slope was dynamic and was never healed by deposition during Unit A times. This study demonstrates the significant influence that even subtle basin-floor topography has on flow behaviour and depositional architecture of submarine lobe complexes. In addition, we present a new aggradational lobe fringe facies associations and recognition criteria for subtle confinement in less well-exposed and subsurface basin fills.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Orr, R.; Taylor, R.; Webb, K. J.; Kaltsoyannis, N.","2019","In order to explore the potential of heat treatment to decontaminate chloride-contaminated legacy plutonium dioxide (PuO2) powders from the UK stockpile, samples retrieved from storage have been heated in air from 400 to 950 °C. These samples also contain high levels of other adsorbed gases from the atmosphere, including water. The amounts of chloride remaining on the PuO2 particles after heat treatment (measured by a caustic leaching process) decrease whilst the amounts of volatilised chloride increase with increasing heat treatment temperature. Clear evidence for a nonleachable (strongly bound) chloride species on the PuO2 surface is found from the thermal treatments. The lattice parameter decreases with increasing heat treatment temperature, reflecting annealing of structural defects caused by over 35 years of radiation damage, with no change in the fcc Fm m crystal structure. Heating chloride-contami 3 nated PuO2 powder to ~230 °C and cooling back to ambient temperature in a sealed vessel reveals the production of H2, He, NO and CO gases. Water adsorption/desorption behaviour with the untreated PuO2 powder is remarkably different than PuO2 which had previously been heat treated at 700 °C. From thermal treatments in open and sealed systems it is concluded that water and chloride co-adsorb and interact on the PuO2 surface and each affects the adsorption/desorption behaviour of the other. These data also support practical considerations for repackaging of chloride-contaminated PuO2 for long term safe and secure storage at Sellafield.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Both fuels received government support during a time of rapid growth in the motor industry, fluctuating economic conditions and fears of absolute oil shortages. Governance of fuel distribution in particular had significant effects on the economic feasibility of both fuels and their ability to penetrate a market dominated by the oil industry incumbents. The paper presents a rich, complex story of how the development of these fuels interacted with fluctuating political perceptions of energy security, changes in the framing of energy and shifts in governance, in what were to become failed attempts at path creation and transition.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Presented by one MP to another, these translations demonstrate the interest in Greek oratory and its political uses in early modern England. Osborne’s manuscripts are also highly unusual in showing a Tudor translator of the classics at work; and the main focus of this essay is on the corrections and changes in the two surviving manuscripts of the translation of Against Leptines (BL Add MS 10059 and Bibliothèque Nationale de France, MS fonds anglais, 60). The essay argues that Osborne’s departures from his source texts evidence a deeper concern to reproduce the political efficacy of Demosthenes’ and Aeschines’ speeches in Elizabethan England. The essay thus throws new light on both early modern translation practice and the use of manuscript texts to bind together communities through the exchange of material which is designed to appeal to a communal identity.","Navy","University of Manchester"

This chapter examines the petitioning and negotiating work of Haiti’s French creditors in the nineteenth century to demonstrate how investors in the former colony engaged the French government in claims for official support and how their lobbying and mobilization enjoined the state to work out the nature of its goals and responsibility in postcolonial economic relations. In practical terms, the Haitian loan helped institutionalize legal and political principles, as well as institutions like bondholder associations, that were foundational to France’s economic imperialism throughout the nineteenth century. More broadly, through decades of letter-writing, public meetings, pamphlet and article publications, Haiti’s creditors engaged themselves and the French public in processes of imagining and argumentation about the value of that imperialism. The amounts of money at stake were small from the French perspective. However, by placing these monetary exchanges in the context of the intense legal, political, and emotional mobilization they generated, we can revive the complexity of economic decolonization and retrieve their significant impact on the elaboration of a habitus of imperial extraction.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Through examining the life stories of arguably the most famous Nanai and Hezhe – singers and actors named Kola Beldy and Han Geng – the Russia-China border is revealed not only as a firm and strictlypoliced line in physical space, but also as a gap between worlds of possibility and projected aspiration. Beldy and Han’s cases show that many borderland dwellers live with their backs to the border, subtly reinforcing the inter-state divide in everyday ways at least as powerful as official sovereignty regimes.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Forty-one normal-hearing children aged 8 – 11 years performed a narrative speech-picture verification task in a condition with recommended levels of background noise (‘ideal’; +15 dB SNR), and a condition with typical classroom background noise levels (‘typical’; -2 dB SNR). Participants showed increased task-evoked pupil dilation in the ‘typical’ versus the ‘ideal’ listening condition, consistent with an increase in listening effort. No differences were found between listening conditions in terms of performance accuracy and response time on the behavioural task. Similarly, no differences were found between listening conditions in self-report and pupillometric markers of listening-related fatigue. This is the first study to: (i) examine listening-related fatigue in children using pupillometry, and (ii) demonstrate physiological evidence consistent with increased listening effort while listening to spoken narratives, despite ceiling level task performance accuracy. Understanding of the physiological mechanisms that underpin listening-related effort and fatigue could inform intervention strategies and ultimately mitigate listening difficulties in children.","Navy","University of Manchester"

It is hard to think of another playwright whose naked, or semi-naked, body has appeared in print so often, or indeed, at all. In this respect, as in many others, Orton stands out from his contemporaries. Through detailed analysis of his diaries, correspondence and interviews as well as close study of photographs of him this essay explores Orton’s self-presentation through clothing, his understanding of the politics of dress and the invitation and challenge this offered to audiences of his work and interviews. This project also requires a detailed consideration of Orton’s partner Kenneth Halliwell’s clothing and challenges the still depressingly pervasive view of him as a middle aged nonentity’. Developing Simon Shepherd’s work on Orton in Because We’re Queers (1989) in to the realm of material culture I suggest that, like the collages they produced, Orton and Halliwell’s self-presentation presented an invitation and challenge to look again, and look closely, at their work and the queer challenge it presents.","Navy","University of Manchester"

This was the culmination of years of growing interest in adopting Vietnamese ‘orphans’. Contemporary newspaper reports credited television and photographs with motivating potential adopters. Adding to scholarship which explores how photographs create discourses of ‘rescue’ and ‘responsibility’ in humanitarian contexts, this article examines how arguments for transnational adoption as a solution to Vietnam’s ‘orphan problem’ developed in the years leading up to Babylift. It notes stark differences in depictions of white-Amerasian and black-Amerasian children in keeping with racial discourses of early 1970s America. The work of female journalists in Vietnam has historically been marginalized; this article redresses this, arguing that American women photographers offered a specific perspective on the ‘orphan problem’.","Navy","University of Manchester"

In this paper, we draw on thinking about punk subcultures to recognise the ways in which leaders hold self-expression and identity as important, while also thinking about how leaders as a collective might push back against some of the narrow ideas of who or what a school leader can be and do. We present findings from a mixed-methods study of women school leaders from around the world. Drawing on an anonymous survey and interviews, and literatures from sociology, fashion studies, and cultural studies, we explore women’s experiences and identities as school leaders.

We classify these point sources intotypes according to their infrared spectral features, continuum and spectral energy distribution shape, bolometric luminosity, cluster membership, and variability information, using a decisiontree classification method. We then refine the classification using supplementary information from the astrophysical literature. We find that our IRS sample is comprised substantially of YSO andHii regions, post-Main Sequence low-mass stars: (post-)AGB stars and planetary nebulae and massive stars including several rare evolutionary types. Two supernova remnants, a nova and several background galaxies were also observed. We use these classifications to improve our understanding of the stellar populations in the Large Magellanic Cloud, study the compositionand characteristics of dust species in a variety of LMC objects, and to verify the photometric classification methods used by mid-IR surveys. We discover that some widely-used catalogues of objects contain considerable contamination and others are missing sources in our sample.","Navy","University of Manchester"

In particular, the thesis documents the gradual emergence of threecharacteristics associated with the transition from a judicial to an administrativemonarchy: the introduction of new decision making and implementation procedureswhich prioritise executive government and limited consultation; the consolidationof a new understanding of the role of monarchical government which places lessemphasis on the provision of justice and more on the king’s responsibility formatters of economic government and development; and a reshuffling of the eliteswhich make up governmental institutions in favour of individuals with directconnections to the new royal household, distinguished more for their loyalty,administrative efficiency or military merit than for their social status anddistinctions.The thesis studies the suppression of viceregal rule in the Crown of Aragon,the initially failed but later successful attempts to establish a third viceroyalty inSpanish America, and the changing social origins, and career paths of the menappointed as viceroys through the period as well as the changing expectationsplaced on them. The thesis highlights important parallels between the reformsintroduced in Peninsular Spain and Spanish America, both in their aims and thepersonnel chosen to implement them. It thus suggests that Spanish ministers duringthe first half of the eighteenth century often espoused the opinion that the Crownshould look at the Indies, in the words of José del Campillo, ‘as a sizeable portionof the Monarchy in which it is possible to implement the same improvements as inSpain’.","Navy","University of Manchester"

In the von Neumann architecture, processing and memory units are implemented as separate blocks interchanging data intensively and continuously. This data transfer is responsible for a large part of the power consumption. The next generation computer technology is expected to solve problems at the exascale with 1018 calculations each second. Even though these future computers will be incredibly powerful, if they are based on von Neumann type architectures, they will consume between 20 and 30 megawatts of power and will not have intrinsic physically built-in capabilities to learn or deal with complex data as our brain does. These needs can be addressed by neuromorphic computing systems which are inspired by the biological concepts of the human brain. This new generation of computers has the potential to be used for the storage and processing of large amounts of digital information with much lower power consumption than conventional processors. Among their potential future applications, an important niche is moving the control from data centers to edge devices. The aim of this roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of neuromorphic technology and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds in the major areas of neuromorphic technology, namely materials, devices, neuromorphic circuits, neuromorphic algorithms, applications, and ethics. The roadmap is a collection of perspectives where leading researchers in the neuromorphic community provide their own view about the current state and the future challenges for each research area. We hope that this roadmap will be a useful resource by providing a concise yet comprehensive introduction to readers outside this field, for those who are just entering the field, as well as providing future perspectives for those who are well established in the neuromorphic computing community.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Yet in ignoring the rising, historians risk missing its value as a tool for understanding the social and political dynamics of late-seventeenth-century Scotland.  This article presents a reassessment of Argyll’s rebellion from that perspective, demonstrating how the insurgency and the government counter-attack threw the ongoing processes of Highland/Lowland convergence into sharp relief, while also revealing the nature, and limitations, of Stuart pretensions towards monarchical ‘absolutism’.","Navy","University of Manchester"

In this case, science diplomacy did not actually have the benign character often ascribed to it. We argue that it was instead an integral part of a set of diplomatic practices aimed at strengthening U.S. global hegemony rather than a means of addressing global concerns.","Navy","University of Manchester"

M.","25 May 2020","This study proposes a method to apply dual criteria for the assessment of product damage based on the deceleration signal in a crash-stop incident. To evaluate the shock effects, a procedure is proposed to decompose the original crash signal into two components, i.e. an equivalent crash signal and a residual shock signal. The characteristics of crash signals are analysed in both time and frequency domains. It is found that the equivalent crash signal can represent the original crash signal if the dominant frequency (fn) of the product structure is relatively lower than the effective frequency (fs) of the crash signal, i.e. . Otherwise, the original crash signal should be used in the assessment of product damage if . The dual damage criteria method is proposed by combing the maximum-acceleration vs. velocity-change (Amax-ΔV) diagram and shock response spectrum (SRS), i.e. the former can offer a lower bound of damage boundary on Amax-ΔV diagram while the latter can define an upper bound of damage boundary on SRS graph. The method of dual damage criteria is illustrated numerically using two types of cantilever beams, as an example. The proposed method can be applied with the critical SRS (Sc) method recommended in ASTM D3332-99 for the packaging design and test, and may also be considered in the design and test of other impact energy and shock absorbers in a crash-stop incident.","Navy","University of Manchester"
"Reporting and Interpreting Legal Violence in Asia: the East India Company's accounts of torture, 1603-24","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/reporting-and-interpreting-legal-violence-in-asia-the-east-india-","Smith, E.","2018","This article examines how printed accounts of torture can reveal the ways the law was experienced, interpreted and reported by the East India Company (EIC) during the early decades of the seventeenth century. It will explore how the company came to impose its own interpretation of the law when interacting with local powers and people while simultaneously attempting to adapt to and operate within existing legal systems in early modern Asia. This careful balance—sustaining English law while accepting the restraints of a different legal system—was essential in a region where merchants and other travellers moved through areas criss-crossed with overlapping jurisdictions. Interactions with locals often turned violent, even when under the protection of local states, and the English used legal violence to sustain their position in Asia as much as they were threatened by its use by others. Concepts of how the law operated were far from simple and overlapping legal institutions, customs and ideas resulted in numerous moments of competition as different legal structures were imposed simultaneously. The company was forced to think carefully about these issues when law and violence came together during the most violent aspect of judicial enquiry—torture. To assess how the EIC thought about the law and how this influenced the development of their imperial policies this article will focus on how information regarding the law—in its most extreme application—was reported to an English and European audience through the careful presentation of information regarding events in Asia.It will focus on two case studies where torture was experienced by English merchants—and where accounts were deemed important enough for reportage and printed distribution. The accounts considered here, reporting the experience of torture in Bantam in 1603 and in Amboyna in 1623, were carefully developed and distributed by the company and intended to effectively present its ideas regarding the law and jurisdiction in the developing world of global commerce and empire. In the first, we see the English factors at Bantam seeking to operate within the parameters of the local rulers but increasingly turning to their own understanding of the law in response to threats. The account of this episode reveals how the company justified the seizure of legal authority through the effective interpretation of both English ideas of proof and their own grasp of international law. The second account covers an opposing scenario, where Dutch merchants seized legal authority over the English in contravention—or so the company claimed—of the law of nature and failing to effectively follow the rules of law regarding proof. Across the two accounts we see how the company struggled to come to terms with the ways it interpreted the law. This is turn defined how it developed policies regarding its role overseas, and the reporting of these legal encounters in England changed the way that other parts of the world and the challenges of international trade were understood.","Navy","University of Manchester"

H.; Crawford, N. (ed.); Lutz, C. (ed.)","Jun 2011","The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been experienced not only on the battlefield; they have reverberated inside the homes of military families left behind in the United States by deploying service members. When they return, the wars come with them. Service members cope with the emotional and physical scars and the employment disruptions of their service. Moreover, more frequent deployment and shorter periods at home between deployments have made this a significantly more difficult set of wars for military families than those of the past. National Guard and Reserve members have been called away for unprecedented periods, affecting both their families and the communities that have gone without their service and their economic contributions.Over two million service members have been to the wars and returned since 2001. Many times that number of Americans has been affected as spouses, parents, children, and friends: they have each coped with their loved ones’ absence, worried for their safety, and dealt with the changed person who usually returns. This is the central way in which the war’s violence has rippled through the nation, affecting families and the communities where they live. Child abuse has been three times higher in homes from which a parent is deployed, for example, and police and courts are dealing with skyrocketing partner abuse rates, which are up 177 percent in Army families since 2003.While resilience is real, the burdens of these wars that have fallen on veterans and their families include higher rates of suicide and mental illness, increased drug and alcohol dependence, higher rates of violence including homicide and child abuse and neglect (the latter both among the parent left behind and by the returning veteran), high risk behaviors that have resulted in elevated numbers of car crashes and drug overdoses, elevated levels of homelessness and divorce, and clinical levels of stress among the children.The causes of these elevated levels of suffering and chaos in veterans’ and their families’ lives are complex and are not all simply the direct result of combat exposure. A third of all suicides are in service members never deployed to the war zones. Some of the elevated rates of interpersonal violence can be accounted for by higher rates of drug use, some of which begins with military prescriptions. The factors contributing to this large number and significant scale of problems are not all fully understood, but the statistics are alarming. The Department of Defense has resisted measuring some of these problems and has mostly focused on attributing them to individual soldier characteristics. Most of these problems, however, must be counted as direct and indirect consequences of a decade of war.","Navy","University of Manchester"

At the same time, the foundational economy—which meets the everyday needs of citizens for housing, utilities, food and mobility—is a stabiliser. It suggests a focus on controllable internal accelerators and stabilisers to improve the quality of foundational provision, rather than a view of cities competing for resources to pursue success through agglomeration.","Navy","University of Manchester"

"Harming Civilians and the Associative Duties of Soldiers","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/harming-civilians-and-the-associative-duties-of-soldiers","Van Goozen, S.","2016","According to International Humanitarian Law and many writing on just war theory, combatants who foresee that their actions will harm or kill innocent non-combatants are required to take some steps to reduce these merely foreseen harms. However, because often reducing merely foreseen harms place burdens on combatants—including risk to their lives—this requirement has been criticised for requiring too much of combatants. One reason why this might be the case is that combatants have duties to each other and to their compatriots, such as duties to keep them safe, which are weighty enough to override their duties to foreign non-combatants. In this paper, I argue that arguments against the requirement to limit merely foreseen harms which rely on combatants’ associative duties fail to establish that it is permissible for combatants to prioritise their own safety over the reduction of merely foreseen harms. Although the argument based on associative duties might work in individual cases, factors peculiar to the situation of combatants mean that such justifications are not normally available to them.","Navy","University of Manchester"

With the end of the Cold War, demand from the defence sector virtually collapsed. The data presented in this thesis reveal the consequent global restructuring of the industry. Over the five year period 1990-1995, European market share fell over twenty percentage points, while that of Japan increased markedly. Meanwhile, US production levels faltered and then recovered following government intervention to stabilise this dual-use technology. This thesis examines the subsequent international shift in the location and ownership of carbon fibre production capacity and the variation in corporate response over this turbulent time. It is found that the national business systems in which this particular high technology sector operates have played a fundamental role in shaping the eventual competitive structure of the industry.","Navy","University of Manchester"

Focusing on the wider context and two contrasting cases (the 1980 Gardner and 1984 Cammell Laird occupations), this article advances six key reasons why this decline has taken place. First, the decline of manufacturing and rising unemployment in the 1980s; second, an overall decline in strikes more generally in terms of their incidence and duration; third, anti-union legislation and policing; fourth, the lack of a positive demonstration effect with regard to ‘successful’ examples of occupations in the 1980s; fifth, the decline of debates around alternative forms of ownership including nationalization and the incipient workers control/ cooperatives movement, and sixth, the decline of the far left and the networks that had sustained occupations to some extent in the 1970s and 1980s.","Navy","University of Manchester"

E. J.; Leys, D.; Scrutton, N. S.","Apr 2015","How cobalamin-dependent enzymes promote C-Co homolysis to initiate radical catalysis has been debated extensively. For the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and cobalamin-dependent enzymes lysine 5,6-aminomutase and ornithine 4,5-aminomutase (OAM), large-scale re-orientation of the cobalamin-binding domain linked to C-Co bond breakage has been proposed. In these models, substrate binding triggers dynamic sampling of the B12 -binding Rossmann domain to achieve a catalytically competent 'closed' conformational state. In 'closed' conformations of OAM, Glu338 is thought to facilitate C-Co bond breakage by close association with the cobalamin adenosyl group. We investigated this using stopped-flow continuous-wave photolysis, viscosity dependence kinetic measurements, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of a series of Glu338 variants. We found that substrate-induced C-Co bond homolysis is compromised in Glu388 variant forms of OAM, although photolysis of the C-Co bond is not affected by the identity of residue 338. Electrostatic interactions of Glu338 with the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group of B12 potentiate C-Co bond homolysis in 'closed' conformations only; these conformations are unlocked by substrate binding. Our studies extend earlier models that identified a requirement for large-scale motion of the cobalamin domain. Our findings indicate that large-scale motion is required to pre-organize the active site by enabling transient formation of 'closed' conformations of OAM. In 'closed' conformations, Glu338 interacts with the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group of cobalamin. This interaction is required to potentiate C-Co homolysis, and is a crucial component of the approximately 10(12) rate enhancement achieved by cobalamin-dependent enzymes for C-Co bond homolysis.","Navy","University of Manchester"

However, recent findings of slow but steady per capita economic growth suggest that this is a historically inaccurate portrait of early modern England. This growth pattern was in part driven byspecialization and structural change accompanied by an increase in market participation at both the intensive and extensive levels. These, I argue, were supported by the gradual increase in money supply made possible by the importation of precious metals from America. They allowed for a substantial increase in the monetization and liquidity levels of the economy, hence decreasing transaction costs, increasing market thickness, changing the relative incentive for participating in the market, and allowing for agglomeration economies. By making trade with Asia possible, precious metals also induced demand for new desirable goods, which in turn encouraged market participation.

The present study aimed to examine subjective, behavioral, and physiological indices of listening-related fatigue. Twenty-four normal-hearing young adults performed a speech-picture verification task in different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) while their pupil size was monitored and response times recorded. Growth curve analysis revealed a significantly steeper linear decrease in pupil size in the more challenging SNR, but only in the second half of the trial block. Changes in pupil dynamics over the course of the more challenging listening condition block suggest a reduction in physiological arousal. Behavioral and self-report measures did not reveal any differences between listening conditions. This is the first study to show reduced physiological arousal during a sustained listening task, with changes over time consistent with the onset of fatigue.","Navy","University of Manchester"

"Psychology, Extreme Environments, and Counter-terrorism Operations","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/psychology-extreme-environments-and-counter-terrorism-operations","Smith, N.; Barrett, E.","2018","Counter-terrorism (CT) operations may involve intelligence-gathering, reconnaissance, surveillance, or direct action (e.g., arrest) to disrupt terrorist activities, and can take place in domestic settings and on international deployments. They involve defence, security, and law enforcement personnel, who often enter risky and dangerous settings, exposing themselves to diverse physical, psychological, and social stressors. The extent to which a person adjusts and adapts to these stressors has implications for safety, performance, health, and well-being. Despite their importance, the psychological aspects of CT operations have received scant research attention. This paper explores what we might learn from the research on performance and health in other extreme environments to support the work of CT professionals operating in hazardous settings. Guided by a model of stress and coping in extreme environments, we review potential physical, psychological, and social stressors and discuss mitigating factors and coping strategies. A systematic, evidence-based understanding of stress and coping in dangerous settings will be of value to those involved in planning CT operations, enhancing understanding of the impact that stressors and constraints could have on the safety, performance, and health of operational personnel, and providing pointers to effective mitigation.

ABSTRACT

With the world’s ninth largest economy and comprising nearly 60% of South America’s GDP, 47% of its territory, and 49% of its population, Brazil has become a regional power and an important actor in world affairs over recent decades. This scenario has led the government to re-evaluate its role in the world order, resulting in the enactment of the National Defence Policy, whose objective was to consolidate the country as a regional power while at the same time addressing national security issues, promoting economic development through a series of defence programmes, restructuring the defence industrial base, fostering innovation through technology and knowledge transfer to Brazil, and indigenous research and development. However, the policy’s implementation suffers from several challenges discussed in this article, which may test the capability and competence of Brazilian policymakers, military, industrialists, and other individuals and organisations involved in its implementation.","Navy","University of Manchester"

"Chlamydia: A Disease Without A History","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/chlamydia-a-disease-without-a-history","Worboys, M.","1 Oct 2019","Chlamydia as an STI is a disease without a history in two senses: firstly, it only became a clinical entity in the 1970s; and secondly, its medical and social history has still to be written – an absence this chapter will begin to correct. Its seeming novelty in the 1970s prompts the question: was it an infection newly arrived in humans, or had it always been present and was now being recognised for the first time? This is a question that can only be answered, not by a medical historian, but by investigations of past populations by epidemiologists, pathologists and, perhaps most likely, by archaeologists using genomics. However, medical publications and oral testimony reveal that doctors in the 1970s were confident that chlamydia was not a new disease. They believed this new ailment had actually been around for decades and probably centuries, being one, probably the most important, of the infections that had been hidden in that most unsatisfactory disease entity non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), also called non-specific urethritis (NSU). NGU was defined by what it was not. It required a laboratory diagnosis and had been invented by clinicians when, in patients with gonorrhoea-like symptoms, the gonococcus —could not be found in genital discharges. NGU was unaffected by antibiotics used to treat gonorrhoea, which became further negative diagnostic confirmation. The laboratory was also crucial to the creation of chlamydia as a clinical entity, which came from the development of new techniques in the 1960s and 1970s which enabled doctors to differentiate NGU into component infections: C. trachomatis, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV, which was later shown to be caused by different strains of C. trachomatis from those causing chlamydia), Mycoplasma genitalium and trichomoniasis (caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis).","Navy","University of Manchester"
"Geochemical constraints on basalt petrogenesis in the Strait of Sicily Rift Zone (Italy): Insights into the importance of short lengthscale mantle heterogeneity","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/geochemical-constraints-on-basalt-petrogenesis-in-the-strait-of-s","White, J. C.; Neave, D. A.; Rotolo, S. G.; Parker, D. F.","2020","Igneous activity from the late Miocene to historic time (most recently 1891 CE) in the Strait of Sicily has created two volcanic islands (Pantelleria and Linosa) and several seamounts. These volcanoes are dominated by transitional (ol + hy-normative) to alkaline (ne-normative) basaltic lavas and scoriae; volcanic felsic rocks (peralkaline trachyte-rhyolite) crop out only on Pantelleria. Although most likely erupted through continental crust, basalts demonstrate no evidence of crustal contamination and are geochemically similar to oceanic island basalts (OIB). Despite their isotopic similarities, there are considerable compositional differences with respect to major and trace element geochemistry both between and within the two islands that are due to short-length scale mantle heterogeneity beneath the region as well as variability in partial melting and magma storage conditions. Published geophysical surveys suggest that lithospheric thickness beneath both islands is ~60 km; this is consistent with the results of our geochemical modelling (59–60 km), which also suggest mantle potential temperatures between 1415 and 1435 °C, similar to those documented in other continental passive rifts. Trace element and isotopic data reveal that the asthenosphere beneath the Strait of Sicily is heterogenous at both inter-island (100s of km) and intra-island (10s of km) scales. Although there is some compositional overlap between the two major synthems at Linosa, in general the older magmas (Arena Bianca, 700 ka) formed as a result of ~5% partial melting of a depleted MORB mantle (DMM) source enriched with a relatively small amount of recycled MORB material, whereas the younger magmas (Monte Bandiera, 530 ka) formed as a result of ~2% partial melting of a similar mantle source. Pantelleria magmas formed from a higher degree (~6%) of partial melting of a DMM source with a relatively greater amount of recycled MORB material and possibly other components. Geochemical modelling also suggests the older magmas on Linosa differentiated at a much shallower level (~8 km) than the younger magmas (~25 km, at or below the base of the crust) prior to eruption. Magmas stored in higher-level reservoirs were effectively homogenized and preserve a narrower compositional range than magmas sourced from depth. Data for the seamounts are scarce and compromised by significant seawater alteration; thus, these volcanic centers cannot be modelled but based on comparative geochemistry with the islands are likely the result of even smaller (<2%) degrees of partial melting beneath thicker (>60 km) lithosphere. Despite the geophysical similarities between the two islands in terms of lithospheric thickness and crustal thinning, melt productivity has been greater at Pantelleria, producing a much larger island and sustaining felsic magmatism, which we hypothesize may ultimately be entirely due to the local occurrence of much more fusible mantle.","Navy","University of Manchester"
"Volcaniclastic deposits and sedimentation processes around volcanic ocean islands: the central Azores: Volcaniclastic deposits in the central Azores","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/volcaniclastic-deposits-and-sedimentation-processes-around-volcan","Chang, Y-C.; Mitchell, N.","2021","Geological histories of volcanic ocean islands can be revealed by the sediments shed by them. Hence there is an interest in studying cores of volcaniclastic sediments that are particularly preserved in the many flat-floored basins lying close to the Azores islands. We analyse four gravity cores collected around the central group of the islands. Three sedimentary facies (F1- F2a, F2b) are recognized based on visual core logging, particle morphometric and geochemical analyses. F1 is clay-rich hemipelagite comprising homogeneous mud with mottled structures from bioturbation. F2a and F2b are both clay-poor volcaniclastic deposits, which are carbonate- rich and carbonate-poor, respectively. More biogenic carbonate in F2a reflects the incorporation of unconsolidated calcareous material from island shelves or bioturbation. Within F2a and F2b we identify deposits emplaced by pyroclastic fallout, primary or secondary turbidity currents by combining multiple information from lithological composition, sedimentary structures, chemical composition of volcanic glass shards and morphometric characteristics of volcanic particles. Primary volcaniclastic sediments were found in all four cores, echoing activity known to have occurred up to historical times on the adjacent islands. These preliminary results suggest that greater details of geological events could be inferred for other volcanic islands by adopting a similar approach to core analysis.","Navy","University of Manchester"

"Discovering the arrow of time in machine learning","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/discovering-the-arrow-of-time-in-machine-learning","Kasmire, J.; Zhao, A.","12 Oct 2021","Machine learning (ML) is increasingly useful as data grows in volume and accessibility. ML can perform tasks (e.g. categorisation, decision making, anomaly detection, etc.) through experience and without explicit instruction, even when the data are too vast, complex, highly variable, full of errors to be analysed in other ways. Thus, ML is great for natural language, images, or other complex and messy data available in large and growing volumes. Selecting ML models for tasks depends on many factors as they vary in supervision needed, tolerable error levels, and ability to account for order or temporal context, among many other things. Importantly, ML methods for tasks that use explicitly ordered or time-dependent data struggle with errors or data asymmetry. Most data are (implicitly) ordered or time-dependent, potentially allowing a hidden ‘arrow of time’ to affect ML performance on non-temporal tasks. This research explores the interaction of ML and implicit order using two ML models to automatically classify (a non temporal task) Tweets (temporal data) under conditions that balance volume and complexity ofdata. Results show performance was affected, suggesting researchers should carefully consider time when matching appropriate ML models to tasks, even when time is only implicitly included.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Wind is emulated by an industrial fan. Infrared images, environmental data (ambient temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction) and electrical load data are all captured periodically. A further dataset from an in-service substation is used. Models are created using vector autoregressive and long short-term memory recurrent neural network models in order to further develop the methods presented by Bortoni et al. The results display a clear improvement over those found in the literature, highlighting the utility of modern data-processing techniques. These results present an opportunity to extract meaningful information for long term thermal condition monitoring of power substations.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

"Clinical Text Data in Machine Learning: Systematic Review","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/clinical-text-data-in-machine-learning-systematic-review","Nenadic, G.","31 Mar 2020","Background: Clinical narratives represent the main form of communication within health care, providing a personalized account of patient history and assessments, and offering rich information for clinical decision making. Natural language processing (NLP) has repeatedly demonstrated its feasibility to unlock evidence buried in clinical narratives. Machine learning can facilitate rapid development of NLP tools by leveraging large amounts of text data.Objective: The main aim of this study was to provide systematic evidence on the properties of text data used to train machine learning approaches to clinical NLP. We also investigated the types of NLP tasks that have been supported by machine learning and how they can be applied in clinical practice.Methods: Our methodology was based on the guidelines for performing systematic reviews. In August 2018, we used PubMed, a multifaceted interface, to perform a literature search against MEDLINE. We identified 110 relevant studies and extracted information about text data used to support machine learning, NLP tasks supported, and their clinical applications. The data properties considered included their size, provenance, collection methods, annotation, and any relevant statistics.Results: The majority of datasets used to train machine learning models included only hundreds or thousands of documents. Only 10 studies used tens of thousands of documents, with a handful of studies utilizing more. Relatively small datasets were utilized for training even when much larger datasets were available. The main reason for such poor data utilization is the annotation bottleneck faced by supervised machine learning algorithms. Active learning was explored to iteratively sample a subset of data for manual annotation as a strategy for minimizing the annotation effort while maximizing the predictive performance of the model. Supervised learning was successfully used where clinical codes integrated with free-text notes into electronic health records were utilized as class labels. Similarly, distant supervision was used to utilize an existing knowledge base to automatically annotate raw text. Where manual annotation was unavoidable, crowdsourcing was explored, but it remains unsuitable because of the sensitive nature of data considered. Besides the small volume, training data were typically sourced from a small number of institutions, thus offering no hard evidence about the transferability of machine learning models. The majority of studies focused on text classification. Most commonly, the classification results were used to support phenotyping, prognosis, care improvement, resource management, and surveillance.Conclusions: We identified the data annotation bottleneck as one of the key obstacles to machine learning approaches in clinical NLP. Active learning and distant supervision were explored as a way of saving the annotation efforts. Future research in this field would benefit from alternatives such as data augmentation and transfer learning, or unsupervised learning, which do not require data annotation.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Furthermore, the level of abstraction of the models is too low, thus hindering the automated transformation process. We propose a novel approach which uses high abstraction requirements models in the form of Object System Models (OSMs) as targets for the transformation of natural language specifications in conjunction with appropriate text mining and machine learning techniques.

The evaluations are often presented numerically in the form of five-dimensional ‘GRBAS’ scores. Computerised voice quality assessment may be carried out using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques which process recorded segments of a patient’s voice to measure certain acoustic features such as periodicity, jitter and shimmer. However, these acoustic features are often not obviously related to GRBAS scores that are widely recognised and understood by clinicians. This paper investigates the use of machine learning (ML) for mapping acoustic feature measurements to more familiar GRBAS scores. The training of the ML algorithms requires accurate and reliable GRBAS assessments of a representative set of voice recordings, together with corresponding acoustic feature measurements. Such ‘reference’ GRBAS assessments were obtained in this work by engaging a number of highly trained SLTs as raters to independently score each voice recording. Clearly, the consistency of the scoring is of interest, and it is possible to measure this consistency and take it into account when computing the reference scores, thus increasing their accuracy and reliability. The properties of well known techniques for the measurement of consistency, such as intra-class correlation (ICC) and the Cohen and Fleiss Kappas, are studied and compared for the purposes of this paper. Two basic ML techniques, i.e. K-nearest neighbour regression and multiple linear regression were evaluated for producing the required GRBAS scores by computer. Both were found to produce reasonable accuracy according to a repeated cross-validation test.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

G.; Giannakeas, N.; Tzallas, A. T.; Brown, G.","7 Oct 2019","In this paper, a hybrid learning approach, which combines the extreme learning machine (ELM) with a genetic algorithm (GA), is proposed. The utilization of this hybrid algorithm enables the creation of heterogeneous single layer neural networks (SLNNs) with better generalization ability than traditional ELM in terms of lower mean square error (MSE) for regression problems or higher accuracy for classification problems. The architecture of this method is not limited to traditional linear neurons, where each input participates equally to the neuron's activation, but is extended to support higher order neurons which affect the network's generalization ability. Initially, the proposed heterogeneous hybrid extreme learning machine (He-HyELM) algorithm creates a number of custom created neurons with different structure, which are used for the creation of homogeneous SLNNs. These networks are trained with ELM and an application specific GA evolves them into heterogeneous networks according to a fitness criterion utilizing the uniform crossover operator for the recombination process. After the completion of the evolution process, the network with the best fitness is selected as the most optimal. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning algorithm can get better results than traditional ELM, homogeneous hybrid extreme learning machine (Ho-HyELM) and optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM) for homogeneous and heterogeneous SLNNs.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

However, this technique retains a high barrier to entry. In particular, configuring image processing parameters for optimal cell profiling is susceptible to cognitive biases, and dependent on user experience. Here, we present an interactive machine learning strategy that learns the optimum cell profiling configuration to maximise quality of the cell profiling outcome. The process is guided by the user, from whom a rating of the quality of a cell profiling configuration is obtained. The machine learning algorithm uses this information to automatically recommend the next configuration to examine. We validated our interactive approach against the standard human trial-and-error scheme to optimise an object segmentation task on the standard software CellProfiler. Our approach enabled rapid optimisation of an object segmentation pipeline, which more accurately segmented objects compared to those optimsed through human trial-and-error.

The most successful have made use of modern deep learning methods, in particular convolutional neural nets. However, such methods only provide a single scalar classification for each galaxy, which fails to account for the varying difficulty of each image. I will present the result of a novel application of a Bayesian convolutional neural network to provide predictions with uncertainty. Measuring uncertainty facilitates understanding the performance of the network and how it might be improved, but more importantly allows us to select the most informative images for citizen scientist classification. This in turn allows the development and deployment of a hybrid system which classifies new surveys more accurately than either humans or machines alone. We will present the performance of such a system with images from DeCALS, and explore how it allows us to scale citizen science classification while still retaining the potential for serendipitous discoveries of unexpected objects such as the Galaxy Zoo 'Peas'. ...","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

This work investigates snow coverage mapping by learning from Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral images via machine-learning methods. To this end, the largest dataset for snow coverage mapping (to our best knowledge) with three typical classes (snow, cloud and background) is first collected and labeled via the semi-automatic classification plugin in QGIS. Then, both random forest-based conventional machine learning and U-Net-based deep learning are applied to the semantic segmentation challenge in this work. The effects of various input band combinations are also investigated so that the most suitable one can be identified. Experimental results show that (1) both conventional machine-learning and advanced deep-learning methods significantly outperform the existing rule-based Sen2Cor product for snow mapping; (2) U-Net generally outperforms the random forest since both spectral and spatial information is incorporated in U-Net via convolution operations; (3) the best spectral band combination for U-Net is B2, B11, B4 and B9. It is concluded that a U-Net-based deep-learning classifier with four informative spectral bands is suitable for snow coverage mapping.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Three sources of data were used: TRansposon-Insertion Phenotypes, Localization and Expression in Saccharomyces (TRIPLES), European Functional Analysis Network (EUROFAN) and Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS). The analysis of the data presented a number of challenges to machine learning: multi-class labels, a large number of sparsely populated classes, the need to learn a set of accurate rules (not a complete classification), and a very large amount of missing values. We modified the algorithm C4.5 to deal with these problems. Results: Rules were learnt which are accurate and biologically meaningful.

As such, they are targeted by attackers to impact their decisions. Text created by machine learning algorithms has many types of applications, some of which can be considered malicious especially if there is an intention to present machine-generated text as human-generated. In this paper, we surveyed major subjects in adversarial machine learning for text processing applications. Unlike adversarial machine learning in images, text problems and applications are heterogeneous. Thus, each problem can have its own challenges. We focused on some of the evolving research areas such as: malicious versus genuine text generation metrics, defense against adversarial attacks, and text generation models and algorithms. Our study showed that as applications of text generation will continue to grow in the near future, the type and nature of attacks on those applications and their machine learning algorithms will continue to grow as well. Literature survey indicated an increasing trend in using pre-trained models in machine learning. Word/sentence embedding models and transformers are examples of those pre-trained models. Adversarial models may utilize same or similar pre-trained models as well. In another trend related to text generation models, literature showed effort to develop universal text perturbations to be used in both black-and white-box attack settings. Literature showed also using conditional GANs to create latent representation for writing types. This usage will allow for a seamless lexical and grammatical transition between various writing styles. In text generation metrics, research trends showed developing successful automated or semi-automated assessment metrics that may include human judgement. Literature showed also research trends of designing and developing new memory models that increase performance and memory utilization efficiency without validating real-time constraints. Many research efforts evaluate different defense model approaches and algorithms.

D.; Sternberg, M. J. E.","1992","Many attempts have been made to solve the problem of predicting protein secondary structure from the primary sequence but the best performance results are still disappointing. In this paper, the use of a machine learning algorithm which allows relational descriptions is shown to lead to improved performance. The Inductive Logic Programming computer program, Golem, was applied to learning secondary structure prediction rules for α/α domain type proteins. The input to the program consisted of 12 non-homologous proteins (1612 residues) of known structure, together with a background knowledge describing the chemical and physical properties of the residues. Golem learned a small set of rules that predict which residues are part of the α-helices—based on their positional relationships and chemical and physical properties. The rules were tested on four independent non-homologous proteins (416 residues) giving an accuracy of 81% (±2%). This is an improvement, on identical data, over the previously reported result of 73% by King and Sternberg (1990, J. Mol. Biol., 216, 441–457) using the machine learning program PROMIS, and of 72% using the standard Gamier-Osguthorpe-Robson method. The best previously reported result in the literature for the α/α domain type is 76%, achieved using a neural net approach. Machine learning also has the advantage over neural network and statistical methods in producing more understandable results.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Based on the published algorithm to estimate the three lengths of the particles from the image pairs (method 1), the average error on the shortest length is around 140% on a test set of particles with different sizes, shapes, and alignment. Therefore, two potential improvements are tested in a simulation setting. The first approach uses an additional projection coupled with an oriented bounding box to estimate the three lengths (method 2). The second approach uses a machine learning model to estimate the three lengths from two projections (method 3). It is shown that method 2 marginally increases the accuracy, while method 3 leads to a significant improvement with an average error of 33% for the shortest characteristic length of particles in the test set and even less for the other lengths. It is shown that this remaining error is caused by the particle alignment with respect to the cameras. Since platelets cannot always be automatically distinguished from quasi-equant particles due to alignment issues, the model was also trained to estimate the three characteristic lengths of quasi-equant particles. The training set and the test set, used for model training and validation, respectively, comprise particles that exhibit quasi-equant, needlelike, and platelike shapes. Several machine learning models are identified and optimized to predict the three particle lengths based on the two projections from the imaging device. Artificial neural networks were chosen because of their superior predictive performance.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

This review focuses on the methodological developments of one such machine learning techniqueâ€”latent class analysisâ€”and how it has contributed to distinguishing asthma and wheezing subtypes in childhood. It also gives a clinical perspective, presenting the findings of studies from the past 5 years that used this approach.

The approach has been implemented to use supervised machine learning to identify traits such as reoccurring patterns, shocks and trends that the workloads exhibit and account for those traits in the forecast.

Solutions based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) have been presented to manage cloud infrastructure, however, these tend to be centralized and suffer in their ability to maintain Quality of Service (QoS) for data centres with thousands of nodes. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning management policy, which can run decentralized, and achieve fast convergence towards efficient resource allocation, resulting in lower SLA violations compared to centralized architectures. To address some of the common challenges in applying RL to cloud resource management, such as slow learning and state/action management, we use parallel learning and reduction of the state/action space. We apply a decision making approach to optimize the migration of a VM and choose a target node to host the VM in such a way that brings response time within SLA level. We have also demonstrate unique, multi-level reinforcement learning cooperation, that further reduces SLA violations. We use simulation to evaluate and demonstrate our proposal in practice, and compare the results obtained with an established heuristic, demonstrating significant improvement to SLA violations and higher scalability.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

High dimensional data with a small number of samples is of critical importance for identifying biomarkers and conducting feasibility and pilot work, however it can lead to biased machine learning (ML) performance estimates. Our review of studies which have applied ML to predict autistic from non-autistic individuals showed that small sample size is associated with higher reported classification accuracy. Thus, we have investigated whether this bias could be caused by the use of validation methods which do not sufficiently control overfitting. Our simulations show that K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) produces strongly biased performance estimates with small sample sizes, and the bias is still evident with sample size of 1000. Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data. The results suggest how to design robust testing methodologies when working with small datasets and how to interpret the results of other studies based on what validation method was used.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

The aim of this study is the spatial prediction of landslide using hybrid machine learning models including bagging (BA), random subspace (RS) and rotation forest (RF) with alternating decision tree (ADTree) as base classifier in the northern part of the Pithoragarh district, Uttarakhand, Himalaya, India. To construct the database, ten conditioning factors and a total of 103 landslide locations with a ratio of 70/30 were used. The significant factors were determined by chi-square attribute evaluation (CSEA) technique. The validity of the hybrid models was assessed by true positive rate (TP Rate), false positive rate (FP Rate), recall (sensitivity), precision, F-measure and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). Results concluded that land cover was the most important factor while curvature had no effect on landslide occurrence in the study area and it was removed from the modelling process. Additionally, results indicated that although all ensemble models enhanced the power prediction of the ADTree classifier (AUCtraining = 0.859; AUCvalidation = 0.813); however, the RS ensemble model (AUCtraining = 0.883; AUCvalidation = 0.842) outperformed and outclassed the RF (AUCtraining = 0.871; AUCvalidation = 0.840), and the BA (AUCtraining = 0.865; AUCvalidation = 0.836) ensemble model.

Identifying all the essential genes of an animal species can reveal critical functions that are needed during the development of the organism.  To inform studies of mouse development, we developed a supervised machine learning classifier based on phenotype data from mouse knockout experiments. We used this classifier to predict the essentiality of mouse genes lacking experimental data. Validation of our predictions against a blind test set of recent mouse knockout experimental data indicates a high level of accuracy (>80%). We also validated our predictions for other mouse mutagenesis methodologies, demonstrating that the predictions are accurate for lethal phenotypes isolated in random chemical mutagenesis screens and embryonic stem cell screens. The biological functions that are enriched in essential and non-essential genes have been identified, showing that essential genes tend to encode intracellular proteins that interact with nucleic acids. The genome distribution of predicted essential and non-essential genes was analysed, demonstrating that the density of essential genes varies throughout the genome.  A comparison with human essential and non-essential genes was performed, revealing conservation between human and mouse gene essentiality status. Our genome-wide predictions of mouse essential genes will be of value for the planning of mouse knockout experiments and phenotyping assays, for understanding the functional processes required during mouse development, and for the prioritisation of disease candidate genes identified in human genome and exome sequence datasets.

When such hypothesis specification is difficult a priori, we propose instead to expose subjects to a variant of the original strategic task that should induce processing it in a way consistent with the postulated model. It is then possible to use machine learning pattern recognition techniques to check if the associated eye-patterns are similar to those recorded during the original task.

A more holistic road asset management approach enhanced by data-informed decision making through effective condition assessment, distress detection, future condition predictions can significantly enhance maintenance planning, prolonging asset life. Recent technology innovations such as Digital Twins have great potentials to enable the needed approach for road condition predictions and a proactive asset management. To this end, machine learning techniques have also demonstrated convincing capabilities in solving engineering problems. However, none of them has been considered specifically within digital twins context. There is therefore a need to review and identify appropriate approaches for the usage of machine learning techniques within road digital twins.This paper provides a systematic literature review of machine learning algorithms used for road condition predictions and discusses findings within the road digital twin framework. The results show that existing machine learning approaches are to some extent, suitable and mature to stipulate successful road digital twin development. Moreover, the review whilst identifying gaps in the literature, indicates several considerations and recommendations required on the journey to road digital twins, and suggests multiple future research directions based on the review summaries of machine learning capabilities.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

D.; Draper, J.; Beale, M. H.","Aug 2010","Metabolite fingerprinting of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants with known or predicted metabolic lesions was performed by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared, and flow injection electrospray-mass spectrometry. Fingerprinting enabled processing of five times more plants than conventional chromatographic profiling and was competitive for discriminating mutants, other than those affected in only low-abundance metabolites. Despite their rapidity and complexity, fingerprints yielded metabolomic insights (e.g. that effects of single lesions were usually not confined to individual pathways). Among fingerprint techniques, 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance discriminated the most mutant phenotypes from the wild type and Fourier transform infrared discriminated the fewest. To maximize information from fingerprints, data analysis was crucial. One-third of distinctive phenotypes might have been overlooked had data models been confined to principal component analysis score plots. Among several methods tested, machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely support vector machine or random forest (RF) classifiers, were unsurpassed for phenotype discrimination. Support vector machines were often the best performing classifiers, but RFs yielded some particularly informative measures. First, RFs estimated margins between mutant phenotypes, whose relations could then be visualized by Sammon mapping or hierarchical clustering. Second, RFs provided importance scores for the features within fingerprints that discriminated mutants. These scores correlated with analysis of variance F values (as did Kruskal-Wallis tests, true and false-positive measures, mutual information, and the Relief feature selection algorithm). ML classifiers, as models trained on one data set to predict another, were ideal for focused metabolomic queries, such as the distinctiveness and consistency of mutant phenotypes.

This approach involves partitioning the flow domain into regions of flow physics called zones, training one ML model in each zone, then validating and testing them on their respective zones. The approach was demonstrated with the tensor basis neural network (TBNN) and another neural net called the turbulent kinetic energy neural network (TKENN). These were used to predict Reynolds stress anisotropy and turbulent kinetic energy respectively in test cases of flow over a solid block, which contain regions of different flow physics including separated flows. The results show that the combined predictions given by the zonal TBNNs and TKENNs were significantly more accurate than their corresponding standard non-zonal models. Most notably, shear anisotropy component in the test cases was predicted at least 20% and 55% more accurately on average by the zonal TBNNs compared to the non-zonal TBNN and RANS, respectively. The Reynolds stress constructed with the zonal predictions was also found to be at least 23% more accurate than those obtained with the non-zonal approach and 30% more accurate than the Reynolds stress predicted by RANS on average. These improvements were attributed to the shape of the zones enabling the zonal models to become highly locally optimized at predicting the output.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

It offers the prospect of mass customization, flexible production, on-demand and decentralized manufacturing. However, a number of challenges stem from not only the complexity of manufacturing systems but the demand for increasingly complex and high-quality products, in terms of design principles, standardization and quality control. These challenges build up barriers to the widespread adoption of AM in the industry and the in-depth research of AM in academia. To tackle the challenges, machine learning (ML) technologies rise to play a critical role as they are able to provide effective ways to quality control, process optimization, modelling of complex systems, and energy management. Hence, this paper employs a systematic literature review method as it is a defined and methodical way of identifying, assessing, and analysing published literature. Then, a keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis are employed for analysing relevant literature. Several aspects of AM, including Design for AM (DfAM), material analytics, in situ monitoring and defect detection, property prediction and sustainability, have been clustered and summarized to present state-of-the-art research in the scope of ML for AM.

Developing machine learning (ML) approaches for requirements classification has attracted great interest in the RE community since the 2000s.Objective:This paper aims to address two related problems that have been challenging real-world applications of ML approaches: the problems of class imbalance and high dimensionality with low sample size data (HDLSS). These problems can greatly degrade the classification performance of ML methods.Methods:The paper proposes HC4RC, a novel ML approach for multiclass classification of requirements. HC4RC solves the aforementioned problems through semantic-role based feature selection, dataset decomposition and hierarchical classification.

The machine learning model that forms the basis behind this work was intended to surrogate a traditional engineering model used in the UK nuclear industry. Previous performance of this model has been hampered by poor performance due to limited training data. Here, we demonstrate that through a combination of additional techniques, model performance can be significantly improved. We show that each of the aforementioned techniques have utility in their own right and in combination with one another. However, we see them best applied when used to fine-tune existing models. Five pre-trained surrogate models produced prior to this study were further trained using an augmented dataset and with our custom loss function. Through the combination of all three techniques, we see an improvement of at least 38% in performance across the five models.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

A.; Zhang, L.; Muñoz, C. Q. G.; Márquez, F. P.

This paper presents a novel delamination classification approach for reliability monitoring systems in wind turbine blades. It is based on the feature extraction of a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input system (NARX) and linear auto-regressive model (AR). A novelty in this paper is NARX as a Feature Extraction method for wind turbine blade delamination classification. Further, the NARX feature is demonstrated to be significantly better than linear AR feature for blade damage detection, and NARX can describe the inherent nonlinearity of blade delamination correctly. A real case study considers different levels of delamination employing ultrasonic guided waves that are sensitive to delamination. Firstly, the signals obtained are filtered and de-noised by wavelet transforms. Then, the features of the signal are extracted by NARX, and the number of features is selected considering the Neighbourhood Component Analysis as main novelties. Finally, six scenarios with different delamination sizes have been performed by supervised Machine Learning methods: Decision Trees, Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neighbours and Ensemble Classification.

This paper presents the Metis+ framework that supports the discovery of business problems using problem hypotheses. Metis+ consists of essential modeling concepts, semantic reasoning methods, and processes for ensuring that potential business problems are analyzed in the context of business goals, hypothesized problems are systematically and explicitly mapped to relevant data features in a data set, and supervised machine learning models are built to get insights into problem hypotheses. Semantic reasoning methods are then utilized to validate or invalidate hypothesized problems. The Metis+ framework is illustrated with a loan case study in the PKDD’99 Financial Data Set.

"Machine learning validation of EEG+tACS artefact removal","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/machine-learning-validation-of-eegtacs-artefact-removal","Kohli, S.; Casson, A. J.","2019","Motivation: Electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during Transcranial Alternating Current Simulation (tACS) is highly desirable in order to investigate brain dynamics during stimulation, but is corrupted by large amplitude stimulation artefacts. Artefact removal algorithms have been presented previously, but with substantial debates on their performance, utility, and the presence of any residual artefacts. This paper investigates whether machine learning can be used to validate artefact removal algorithms. The postulation is that residual artefacts in the EEG after cleaning would be independent of the experiment performed, making it impossible to differentiate between different parts of an EEG+tACS experiment, or between different behavioural tasks performed. Methods: Ten participates undertook two tasks (nBack and backwards digital recall) during simultaneous EEG+tACS, exercising different aspects of working memory. Stimulation during no task and sham conditions were also performed. A previously reported tACS artefact removal algorithm from our group was used to clean the EEG and a Linear Discriminant Analysis was trained on the cleaned EEG to differentiate different parts of the experiment. Results: Baseline, baseline during tACS, working memory task without tACS, and working memory task with tACS data segments could be differentiated with accuracies ranging from 65-94%, far exceeding chance levels. EEG from the nBack and backwards digital recall tasks could be separated during stimulation, with an accuracy exceeding 72%. If residual tACS artefacts remained after the EEG cleaning these did not dominate the classification process. Significance: This helps in building confidence that true EEG information is present after artefact removal. Our methodology presents a new approach to validating tACS artefact removal approaches.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

This paper investigates the sum rate maximization problem of mmWave-NOMA systems under the constraints of the total transmission power and users’ predefined rate requirements. The formulated optimization problem is a non-linear programming problem and, thus, is non-convex and challenging to solve, especially when the number of users becomes large. Sparked by the correlation features of the users’ channels in mmWave-NOMA systems, we develop a K-means based machine learning algorithm for user clustering. Moreover, for a practical dynamic scenario where the new users keep arriving in a continuous fashion, we propose a K-means based on-line user clustering algorithm to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, to further enhance the performance of the proposed mmWave-NOMA system, we derive the optimal power allocation policy in a closed form by exploiting the successive decoding feature. Simulation results reveal that: 1) the proposed machine learning framework enhances the performance of mmWave-NOMA systems compared to the conventional user clustering algorithms; 2) the proposed K-means based on-line user clustering algorithm provides a comparable performance to the conventional K-means algorithm and strikes a good balance between performance and computational complexity.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

As these machine learning tools become more widespread, it is becoming imperative that scientists and researchers become familiar with them, both in terms of understanding the tools and the current limitations of artificial intelligence, and more importantly being able to critically separate the hype from the real potential. This article presents a classroom exercise aimed at first-year science and engineering college students, where a task is set to produce a correlation to predict the normal boiling point of organic compounds from an unabridged data set of >6000 compounds. The exercise, which is fully documented in terms of the problem statement and the solution, guides the students to initially perform a linear correlation of the boiling point data with a plausible relevant variable (the molecular weight) and to further refine it using multivariate linear fitting employing a second descriptor (the acentric factor). Finally, the data are processed through an artificial neural network to eventually provide an engineering-quality correlation. The problem statements, data files for the development of the exercise, and solutions are provided within a MATLAB environment but are general in nature.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

L.; Silva, A. F.; Vincent, M.; Popelier, P.","2017","We present an innovative method for predicting the dynamic electron correlation energy of an atom or a bond in a molecule utilizing topological atoms. Our approach uses the machine learning method Kriging (Gaussian Process Regression with a non-zero mean function) to predict these dynamic electron correlation energy contributions. The true energy values are calculated by partitioning the MP2 two-particle density-matrix via the Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA) procedure. To our knowledge, this is the first time such energies have been predicted by a machine learning technique. We present here three important proof-of-concept cases: the water monomer, the water dimer and the van der Waals complex H2…He. These cases represent the final step towards the design of a full IQA potential for molecular simulation. This final piece will enable us consider situations in which dispersion is the dominant inter-molecular interaction. The results from these examples suggest a new method by which dispersion potentials for molecular simulation can be generated. ","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

The multipole moments predicted by the Kriging models are used in the calculation of atom-atom electrostatic interaction energies. Charge transfer is treated in the same way as dipolar polarisation and the polarisation of higher rank multipole moments.

In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been important for the artform. This is because ML helps process complex biometric datasets from GIs when predicting musical actions (termed performance gestures). ML allows musicians to create novel interactions with digital media. Wekinator is a popular ML software amongst artists, allowing users to train models through demonstration. It is built on the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) framework, which is used to build supervised predictive models. Previous research has used biometric data from GIs to train specific ML models. However, previous research does not inform optimum ML model choice, within music, or compare model performance. Wekinator offers several ML models. Thus, we used Wekinator and the Myo armband GI and study three performance gestures for piano practice to solve this problem. Using these, we trained all models in Wekinator and investigated their accuracy, how gesture representation affects model accuracy and if optimisation can arise. Results show that neural networks are the strongest continuous classifiers, mapping behaviour differs amongst continuous models, optimisation can occur and gesture representation disparately affects model mapping behaviour; impacting music practice.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Formation of a particulate pollution event or haze episode (HE) involves many factors, including meteorology, emissions, and chemistry. Understanding the direct causes of and key drivers behind the HE is thus essential. Traditionally, this is done via chemical transport models. However, substantial uncertainties are introduced into the model estimation when there are significant changes in the emissions inventory due to interventions (e.g., the COVID-19 lockdown). Here we applied a Random Forest model coupled with a Shapley additive explanation algorithm, a post hoc explanation technique, to investigate the roles of major meteorological factors, primary emissions, and chemistry in five severe HEs that occurred before or during the COVID-19 lockdown in China. We discovered that, in addition to the high level of primary emissions, PM2.5 in these haze episodes was largely driven by meteorological effects (with average contributions of 30-65 μg m-3 for the five HEs), followed by chemistry (∼15-30 μg m-3). Photochemistry was likely the major pathway of formation of nitrate, while air humidity was the predominant factor in forming sulfate. Our results highlight that the machine learning driven by data has the potential to be a complementary tool in predicting and interpreting air pollution.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is the approach that explores the interaction between a human and a robot, during the completion of a common objective, at the cognitive and physical level. In HRC works, a cognitive model is typically built, which collects inputs from the environment and from the user, elaborates and translates these into information that can be used by the robot itself. Machine learning is a recent approach to build the cognitive model and behavioural block, with high potential in HRC. Consequently, this paper proposes a thorough literature review of the use of machine learning techniques in the context of human-robot collaboration. 45 key papers were selected and analysed, and a clustering of works based on the type of collaborative tasks, evaluation metrics and cognitive variables modelled is proposed. Then, a deep analysis on different families of machine learning algorithms and their properties, along with the sensing modalities used, is carried out. Among the observations, it is outlined the importance of the machine learning algorithms to incorporate time dependencies. The salient features of these works are then cross-analysed to show trends in HRC and give guidelines for future works, comparing them with other aspects of HRC not appeared in the review.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Pore network extraction is implemented using a watershed segmentation algorithm on 12 three-dimensional porous rock images. The permeabilities of all throats are calculated using the LBM and substituted in the pore network model instead of using the cylindrical formulation for throat's permeability based on the Hagen{Poiseuille equation. Solving the LBM for every throat results in an accurate representation of  flow but the algorithm is computationally expensive. In order to minimize the computational costs, LBM is used to model the steady-state incompressible fluid flow through 9,333 dierent throat images and an Articial Neural Network(ANN) is trained to mimic the trend of throat's permeabilities based on thecross{sectional images. To this end, we extract several morphological featuresof the throats cross{sectional images and search for the best describing feature.It is found that the averaged distance map of the throat images is highly correlated with the LBM-based permeability of throats to the extent that even asimple empirical correlation can reasonably describe the relationship betweenthese two parameters. Finally, we compare the absolute permeability of samplesobtained by full LBM with the presented hybrid method. Results show that the proposed method provides an accurate estimation of permeability witha considerable reduction in the computational CPU time.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

The mapping requires overlaying the spatial effects of multiple factors that contribute to the occurrence of landslide events (rain- fall, land cover, distance to roads, lithology, and slope) and this process requires assigning weights to the different factors contributing to landslides. This study introduces a new statistical approach for quantifying the weights used in landslide susceptibility mapping and their associated uncertainty. The proposed approach combines machine learning (random forest classification) with large-scale sen- sitivity analysis to derive the uncertainty ranges of weights used in landslide susceptibility mapping. The study demon- strates the approach for a case study of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and Sylhet divisions of Bangladesh to understand the implications of weight uncertainty for road susceptibility to landslides. The case study results show that distance to roads is the most influential factor to determine the like- lihood of the occurrence of landslide events, followed by the land cover type. Given weight uncertainty, the percent- age of road lengths in the study area under extremely high susceptibility to landslides ranges from around 20 to 38 per- cent. The tolerance level to weight uncertainty is a crucial determinant of investment costs and is ultimately a critical element for decision making to relevant institutions and affected stakeholders. A conservative selection of weights from within the uncertainty range (a weight combination that results in the highest susceptibility) means that the risk is minimized but with a high investment cost.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

This article has two objectives. First, it clarifies which aspects of English Law are relevant in order to regulate the use of ML in clinical research on psychosis prediction. It is argued that its lawful implementation will depend upon the legal requirements regarding the balance between potential harms and benefits, particularly with reference to: (i) any additional risks introduced by the use of ML for data analysis and outcome prediction; and (ii) the inclusion of vulnerable research populations such as minors or incapacitated adults. Second, this article investigates how clinical prediction via ML might affect the practice of risk assessment under mental health legislation, with reference to English Law. It is argued that there is a potential for virtuous applications of clinical prediction in psychiatry. However, reaffirming the distinction between psychosis risk and risk of harm is paramount. Establishing psychosis risk and assessing a person's risk of harm are discrete practices, and so should remain when using artificial intelligence for psychiatric assessment. Evaluating whether clinical prediction via ML might benefit individuals with psychosis will depend on which risk we try to assess and on what we try to predict, whether this is psychosis transition, a psychotic relapse, self-harm and suicidality, or harm to others.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

FFLUX models are constructed by applying the kriging machine learning method to the topological energy partitioning method, interacting quantum atoms (IQA). The effect of varying parameters in the construction of the FFLUX models is analyzed, with the most dominant effects found to be the structure of the molecule and the number of conformations used to build the model. Using these models, the optimization of a variety of small organic molecules is performed, with sub kJ mol-1 accuracy in the energy of the optimized molecules. The FFLUX models are also evaluated in terms of their performance in describing the potential energy surfaces (PESs) associated with specific degrees of freedoms within molecules. While the accurate description of PESs presents greater challenges than individual minima, FFLUX models are able to achieve errors of <2.5 kJ mol-1 across the full C-C-C-C dihedral PES of n-butane, indicating the future possibilities of the technique.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

We present a new approach using unsupervised machine learning to generate informed priors for retrieval of exoplanetary atmosphere parameters from transmission spectra. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to efficiently compress the information content of a library of transmission spectra forward models generated using the PLATON package. We then apply a k-means clustering algorithm in PCA space to segregate the library into discrete classes. We show that our classifier is almost always able to instantaneously place a previously unseen spectrum into the correct class, for low-to-moderate spectral resolutions, R, in the range R = 30-300 and noise levels up to 10 per cent of the peak-to-trough spectrum amplitude. The distribution of physical parameters for all members of the class therefore provides an informed prior for standard retrieval methods such as nested sampling. We benchmark our informed-prior approach against a standard uniform-prior nested sampler, finding that our approach is up to a factor of 2 faster, with negligible reduction in accuracy. We demonstrate the application of this method to existing and near-future observatories, and show that it is suitable for real-world application. Our general approach is not specific to transmission spectroscopy and should be more widely applicable to cases that involve the repetitive fitting of trusted high-dimensional models to large data catalogues, including beyond exoplanetary science....","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

The developed VML model may not predict faults accurately if applied on other identical machines or a machine with different operation conditions or both. Therefore, the current research is on the development of a VML model by optimising the vibration parameters based on the dynamics of the machine.

EIT reconstruction is a non-linear and ill-posed inverse problem. Consequently, the non-linearity results in a high computational cost of solution, while regularisation and the most informative measurements must be used to overcome ill-posedness. To build the foundation of future research into EIT applications for 2D materials, such as graphene, we designed and implemented a novel approach to measurement optimisation via a machine learning adaptive electrode selection algorithm (A-ESA). Furthermore, we modified the forward solver of a python-based EIT simulation software, pyEIT, to include the complete electrode model (CEM) and employed it on 2D square samples (Liu B et al 2018 SoftwareX 7 304–8; Somersalo E et al 1992 SIAM J. Appl. Math. 52 1023–40). In addition, the deep D-Bar U-Net convolutional neural network architecture was applied to post-process conductivity map reconstructions from the GREIT algorithm (Hamilton and Hauptmann 2018 IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 37 2367–77; Adler et al 2009 Physiol. Meas. 30 S35). The A-ESA offered around 20% lower reconstruction losses in fewer measurements than the standard opposite–adjacent electrode selection algorithm, on both simulated data and when applied to a real graphene-based device. The CEM enhanced forward solver achieved a 3% lower loss compared to the original pyEIT forward model. Finally, an experimental evaluation was performed on a graphene laminate film. Overall, this work demonstrates how EIT could be applied to 2D materials and highlights the utility of machine learning in both the experimental and analytical aspects of EIT.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Given a timely prediction of a dementia outcome in patients, appropriate mitigating interventions can be applied to reduce risk. However such prediction facilities need to be made available to wider populations, and these facilities cannot rely on specialised, costly and invasive testing (such as neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid collection, etc which constitute important instruments used in diagnosis), for interventions to have a meaningful quantitative impact. Hence an emerging need exists for the wider application of prognostic measures which can be  deployed using lower cost data sources such as longitudinal records routinely  collected by general practices. This paper proposes an efficient prediction modelling approach to the risk of dementia, using CPRD data collected from GP practices in UK, and based on machine learning in particular the Gradient  Boosting Machines model combined with a survival model such as the Cox  Proportional Hazard, encapsulated in a semi-supervised learning and model calibration methodology.

In this paper, machine learning (ML) is used for a real-time selection process on preventive actions, such as topology reconfiguration and islanding, aiming to reduce the risk of cascading failures. Training data is obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of cascading failures triggered by extreme events. The trained ML-based decision-making process uses only predictors that are readily available prior to an extreme event, such as event location and intensity, network topology and load, and requires no further time-consuming simulations. The proposed decision-making process is compared to time-consuming but ideal decision-making and fast but trivial decision-making. Demonstrations on the German transmission network show that the proposed ML-based selection process efficiently prevents the uncontrolled propagation of cascading failures and performs similarly to an ideal decision-making process whilst being computationally three orders of magnitude faster.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

For this medical cell recognition problem, there are three different feature sections, namely cytology morphology, nuclear chromatin pathology and region intensity. The challenges of this problem come from feature combination s and classification accurately and efficiently. Thus, we propose an efficient abnormal cervical cell detection system based on multi-instance extreme learning machine (MI-ELM) to deal with above two questions in one unified framework. MI-ELM is one of the most promising supervised learning classifiers which can deal with several feature sections and realistic classification problems analytically. Experiment results over Herlev dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms three traditional methods for two-class classification in terms of well accuracy and less time.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"
"Human-Robot Collaboration and Machine Learning: A Systematic Review of Recent Research","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/human-robot-collaboration-and-machine-learning-a-systematic-revie-2","Semeraro, F.; Griffiths, A.; Cangelosi, A.","11 Jul 2022","Technological progress increasingly envisions the use of robots interacting with people in everyday life. Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is the approach that explores the interaction between a human and a robot, during the completion of an actual physical task. Such interplay is explored both at the cognitive and physical level, by respectively analysing the mutual exchange of information and mechanical power. In HRC works, a cognitive model is typically built, which collects inputs from the environment and from the user, elaborates and translates these into information that can be used by the robot itself. HRC studies progressively employ machine learning algorithms to build the cognitive models and behavioural block that elaborates the acquired external inputs. This is a promising approach still in its early stages and with the potential of significant benefit from the growing field of machine learning. Consequently, this paper proposes a thorough literature review of the use of machine learning techniques in the context of human-robot collaboration. The collection,selection and analysis of the set of 45 key papers, selected from the wide review of the literature on robotics and machine learning, allowed the identification of the current trends in HRC. In particular, a clustering of works based on the type of collaborative tasks, evaluation metrics and cognitive variables modelled is proposed. With these premises, a deep analysis on different families of machine learning algorithms and their properties, along with the sensing modalities used, was carried out. The salient aspects of the analysis are discussed to show trends and suggest possible challenges to tackle in the future research. ","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

We find strong evidence to support ML forecasting power dominating an extended CHAR and all other HAR-family of models using evaluation measures such as MSE, QLIKE, MDA and RC values. The LOB-ML has very strong forecasting power and adding News sentiment variables to the data set only improves the forecasting power marginally. However, the good forecasting performance of ML models is relevant only for normal volatility days (i.e. 90% of the out-of-sample period). Throughout the study, we find a persistent trade-off between normal vs jump day forecasting; one model serves well for normal days performs poorly for jump days, and vice versa.

Several research studies have been published over the last decade on this topic. However, most of the studies are data driven, and the vibration-based ML (VML) model is generally developed on a typical machine. The developed VML model may not predict faults accurately if applied on other identical machines or a machine with different operation conditions or both. Therefore, the current research is on the development of a VML model by optimising the vibration parameters based on the dynamics of the machine. The developed model is then blindly tested at different machine operation conditions to show the robustness and reliability of the proposed VML model.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Previous studies have proposed various data-driven methods to investigate the relationship between building energy consumption and hundreds of potential influencing features. However, it is difficult to include all potential features in one single model since either some data could be unavailable or the model would be too complex. To identify the critical features, this study develops a data-driven random forest (RF) based framework with a dataset of Taipei City, consisting of 24,764 buildings in 881 city-blocks, to model the relationship between city-block-level building-oriented features and building energy consumption. The RF model is found to outperform other machine learning models including logistic regression, k-nearest neighborhood, support vector machine, and decision tree models in the predictive accuracy of the classification problem. Seven critical features related to the built year of buildings, building gross floor area, building density, and the ratio of commercial buildings in the block are identified from the 59 city-block-level building-oriented features. The developed framework could refine the features adopted in regional building energy models, and policymakers and city planners would get practical implications from the identified critical features.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

This requires an automatic framework that can quickly and efficiently provide classification labels for several new object classification challenges. Using data describing 11 types of variable stars from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Surveys (CRTS), we illustrate how to capture the most important information from computed features and describe detailed methods of how to robustly use Information Theory for feature selection and evaluation. We apply three Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and demonstrate how to optimize these classifiers via cross-validation techniques. For the CRTS dataset, we find that the Random Forest (RF) classifier performs best in terms of balanced- accuracy and geometric means. We demonstrate substantially improved classification results by converting the multi-class problem into a binary classication task, achieving a balanced-accuracy rate of 99 per cent for the classification of δ-Scuti and Anomalous Cepheids (ACEP). Additionally, we describe how classification performance can be improved via converting a `at-multi-class' problem into a hierarchical taxonomy. We develop a new hierarchical structure and propose a new set of classification features, enabling the accurate identification of subtypes of cepheids, RR Lyrae and eclipsing binary stars in CRTS data.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

However, in domains like financial 24 education, effective instruction requires frequent, personalized feedback given at the point of 25 decision, which makes it time-consuming for experts to provide and thus prohibitively costly. 26 We address this by demonstrating an automated feedback mechanism that allows amateur 27 decision-makers to learn what information to attend to from one another, rather than from an 28 expert. In the first experiment, eye-movements of N=100 subjects were recorded while they 29 repeatedly performed a standard behavioral finance investment task. Consistent with previous 30 studies, we found that a significant proportion of subjects were affected by decision bias. In the 31 second experiment, a different group of N=100 subjects faced the same task but, after each 32 choice, they received individual, machine-learning-generated feedback on whether their pre-33 decision eye-movements resembled those made by Experiment 1 subjects prior to good 34 decisions. As a result, Experiment 2 subjects learned to analyze information similarly to their 35 successful peers, which in turn reduced their decision bias.

These rules can be used to predict an unknown secondary structure from a known primary structure. The symbolic induction method used by PROMIS was specifically designed to produce rules that are meaningful in terms of chemical properties of the residues. The rules found were compared with existing knowledge of protein structure: some features of the rules were already recognized (e.g. amphipathic nature of α-helices). Other features are not understood, and are under investigation. The rules produced a prediction accuracy for three states (α-helix, β-strand and coil) of 60% for all proteins, 73% for proteins of known a domain type, 62% for proteins of known β domain type and 59% for proteins of known α/β domain type.

C.; Marinho, S.; Simpson, A.; Custovic, A.; Buchan, I. E.","8 May 2014","Background: There is increasing recognition that asthma and eczema are heterogeneous diseases. We investigated the predictive ability of a spectrum of machine learning methods to disambiguate clinical sub-groups of asthma, wheeze and eczema, using a large heterogeneous set of attributes in an unselected population. The aim was to identify to what extent such heterogeneous information can be combined to reveal specific clinical manifestations. Methods. The study population comprised a cross-sectional sample of adults, and included representatives of the general population enriched by subjects with asthma. Linear and non-linear machine learning methods, from logistic regression to random forests, were fit on a large attribute set including demographic, clinical and laboratory features, genetic profiles and environmental exposures. Outcome of interest were asthma, wheeze and eczema encoded by different operational definitions. Model validation was performed via bootstrapping. Results: The study population included 554 adults, 42% male, 38% previous or current smokers. Proportion of asthma, wheeze, and eczema diagnoses was 16.7%, 12.3%, and 21.7%, respectively. Models were fit on 223 non-genetic variables plus 215 single nucleotide polymorphisms. In general, non-linear models achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than other methods, especially for asthma and wheeze, less for eczema, with areas under receiver operating characteristic curve of 84%, 76% and 64%, respectively. Our findings confirm that allergen sensitisation and lung function characterise asthma better in combination than separately. The predictive ability of genetic markers alone is limited. For eczema, new predictors such as bio-impedance were discovered. Conclusions: More usefully-complex modelling is the key to a better understanding of disease mechanisms and personalised healthcare: further advances are likely with the incorporation of more factors/attributes and longitudinal measures. © 2014 Prosperi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

Kinetic analysis lies at the core of mechanistic elucidation by allowing direct testing of mechanistic hypotheses from experimental data. Traditionally, kinetic analysis has relied on the use of initial rates14, logarithmic plots and, more recently, visual kinetic methods15-18, in combination with mathematical rate law derivations. However, the derivation of rate laws and their interpretation requires numerous mathematical approximations, and as a result they are prone to human error and are limited to reaction networks with only a few steps operating under steady state. Here we show that a deep neural network model can be trained to analyze ordinary kinetic data and automatically elucidate its corresponding mechanism class, without any additional user input. The model identifies a wide variety of classes of mechanisms with outstanding accuracy, including mechanisms out of steady-state, such as those involving catalyst activation and deactivation steps, and performs excellently even when the kinetic data contains substantial error or only a few time points. Our results demonstrate that artificial intelligence-guided mechanism classification is a powerful new tool that can streamline and automate mechanistic elucidation. We are making this model freely available to the community and we anticipate this work will lead to further advances in the development of fully automated organic reaction discovery and development.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

E.; Bian, J.","13 Jul 2020","Big data, high-performance computing, and (deep) machine learning are increasingly becoming key to precision medicine—from identifying disease risks and taking preventive measures, to making diagnoses and personalizing treatment for individuals. Precision medicine, however, is not only about predicting risks and outcomes, but also about weighing interventions. Interventional clinical predictive models require the correct specification of cause and effect, and the calculation of so-called counterfactuals, that is, alternative scenarios. In biomedical research, observational studies are commonly affected by confounding and selection bias. Without robust assumptions, often requiring a priori domain knowledge, causal inference is not feasible. Data-driven prediction models are often mistakenly used to draw causal effects, but neither their parameters nor their predictions necessarily have a causal interpretation. Therefore, the premise that data-driven prediction models lead to trustable decisions/interventions for precision medicine is questionable. When pursuing intervention modelling, the bio-health informatics community needs to employ causal approaches and learn causal structures. Here we discuss how target trials (algorithmic emulation of randomized studies), transportability (the licence to transfer causal effects from one population to another) and prediction invariance (where a true causal model is contained in the set of all prediction models whose accuracy does not vary across different settings) are linchpins to developing and testing intervention models.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

A. N.; Sonke, J. J.; van Herk, M.; Alderliesten, T.","9 May 2019","Current state-of-the-art medical deformable image registration (DIR) methods optimize a weighted sum of key objectives of interest. Having a pre-determined weight combination that leads to high-quality results for any instance of a specific DIR problem (i.e., a class solution) would facilitate clinical application of DIR. However, such a combination can vary widely for each instance and is currently often manually determined. A multi-objective optimization approach for DIR removes the need for manual tuning, providing a set of high-quality trade-off solutions. Here, we investigate machine learning for a multi-objective class solution, i.e., not a single weight combination, but a set thereof, that, when used on any instance of a specific DIR problem, approximates such a set of trade-off solutions. To this end, we employed a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to learn sets of weight combinations for three breast DIR problems of increasing difficulty: 10 prone-prone cases, 4 prone-supine cases with limited deformations and 6 prone-supine cases with larger deformations and image artefacts. Clinically-acceptable results were obtained for the first two problems. Therefore, for DIR problems with limited deformations, a multi-objective class solution can be machine learned and used to compute straightforwardly multiple high-quality DIR outcomes, potentially leading to more efficient use of DIR in clinical practice.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

As a part of the evaluation of model performance and error analysis, the prediction accuracy differences of these three models in training, validation and testing sets were discussed, and the influence weight of each input parameter on results was analyzed by permutation feature importance (PFI) index. Results showed that all models revealed good prediction performance for the overall database. BPNN model had the largest number of instances where the error percentage was within ±20%. SVM model showed the highest generalization capability and most stable prediction accuracy among all three. Out of different variables investigated, SiO2 content in FA had the highest influence on strength, followed by Al2O3 content and activator content/concentration.

A.","11 Apr 2008","Background: Availability of information about transcription factors (TFs) is crucial for genome biology, as TFs play a central role in the regulation of gene expression. While manual literature curation is expensive and labour intensive, the development of semi-automated text mining support is hindered by unavailability of training data. There have been no studies on how existing data sources (e.g. TF-related data from the MeSH thesaurus and GO ontology) or potentially noisy example data (e.g. protein-protein interaction, PPI) could be used to provide training data for identification of TF-contexts in literature. Results: In this paper we describe a text-classification system designed to automatically recognise contexts related to transcription factors in literature. A learning model is based on a set of biological features (e.g. protein and gene names, interaction words, other biological terms) that are deemed relevant for the task. We have exploited background knowledge from existing biological resources (MeSH and GO) to engineer such features. Weak and noisy training datasets have been collected from descriptions of TF-related concepts in MeSH and GO, PPI data and data representing non-protein-function descriptions. Three machine-learning methods are investigated, along with a vote-based merging of individual approaches and/or different training datasets. The system achieved highly encouraging results, with most classifiers achieving an F-measure above 90%. Conclusions: The experimental results have shown that the proposed model can be used for identification of TF-related contexts (i.e. sentences) with high accuracy, with a significantly reduced set of features when compared to traditional bag-of-words approach. The results of considering existing PPI data suggest that there is not as high similarity between TF and PPI contexts as we have expected. We have also shown that existing knowledge sources are useful both for feature engineering and for obtaining noisy positive training data. © 2008 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"

C.","29 Jul 2020","Aim: We aim to compare machine learning with neural network performance in predicting R0 resection (R0), length of stay > 14 days (LOS), major complication rates at 30 days postoperatively (COMP) and survival greater than 1 year (SURV) for patients having pelvic exenteration for locally advanced and recurrent rectal cancer. Method: A deep learning computer was built and the programming environment was established. The PelvEx Collaborative database was used which contains anonymized data on patients who underwent pelvic exenteration for locally advanced or locally recurrent colorectal cancer between 2004 and 2014. Logistic regression, a support vector machine and an artificial neural network (ANN) were trained. Twenty per cent of the data were used as a test set for calculating prediction accuracy for R0, LOS, COMP and SURV. Model performance was measured by plotting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUROC). Results: Machine learning models and ANNs were trained on 1147 cases. The AUROC for all outcome predictions ranged from 0.608 to 0.793 indicating modest to moderate predictive ability. The models performed best at predicting LOS > 14 days with an AUROC of 0.793 using preoperative and operative data. Visualized logistic regression model weights indicate a varying impact of variables on the outcome in question. Conclusion: This paper highlights the potential for predictive modelling of large international databases. Current data allow moderate predictive ability of both complex ANNs and more classic methods.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"
"Machine learning approach for crude oil price prediction with Artificial Neural Networks-Quantitative (ANN-Q) model","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/machine-learning-approach-for-crude-oil-price-prediction-with-art","Abdullah, S. N.; Zeng, X.","2010","The volatility of crude oil market and its chain effects to the world economy augmented the interest and fear of individuals, public and private sectors. Previous statistical and econometric techniques used for prediction, offer good results when dealing with linear data. Nevertheless, crude oil price series deal with high nonlinearity and irregular events. The continuous usage of statistical and econometric techniques for crude oil price prediction might demonstrate demotions to the prediction performance. Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence approach through combination of historical quantitative data with qualitative data from experts' view and news is a remedy proposed to predict this. This paper will discuss the first part of the research, focusing on to (i) the development of Hierarchical Conceptual (HC) model and (ii) the development of Artificial Neural Networks-Quantitative (ANN-Q) model. © 2010 IEEE.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"
"Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Performance Prediction of the SPEC Benchmarks","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/comparative-analysis-of-machine-learning-models-for-performance-p","Tousimojarad, A.; Luján, M.","11 Jan 2022","Simulation-based performance prediction is cumbersome and time-consuming. An alternative approach is to consider supervised learning as a means of predicting the performance scores of \hlf{Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation} (SPEC) benchmarks. SPEC CPU2017 contains a public dataset of results obtained by executing 43 standardised performance benchmarks organised into 4 suites on various system configurations. This paper analyses the dataset and aims to answer the following questions: I) can we accurately predict the SPEC results based on the configurations provided in the dataset, without having to actually run the benchmarks? II) what are the most important hardware and software features? III) what are the best predictive models and hyperparameters, in terms of prediction error and time? and IV) can we predict the performance of future systems using the past data? We present how to prepare data, select features, tune hyperparameters and evaluate regression models based on Multi-Task Elastic-Net, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron neural networks estimators. Feature selection is performed in three steps: removing zero variance features, removing highly correlated features, and Recursive Feature Elimination based on different feature importance metrics: elastic-net coefficients, tree-based importance measures and Permutation Importance. We select the best models using grid search on the hyperparameter space, and finally, compare and evaluate the performance of the models. We show that tree-based models with the original 29 features provide accurate predictions with an average error of less than 4%. The average error of faster Decision Tree and Random Forest models with 10 features is still below 6% and 5% respectively.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"
"Identification of transcription factor contexts in literature using machine learning approaches","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/identification-of-transcription-factor-contexts-in-literature-usi-2","Yang, H.; Nenadic, G.; Keane, J. A.","11 Apr 2008","Background: Availability of information about transcription factors (TFs) is crucial for genome biology, as TFs play a central role in the regulation of gene expression. While manual literature curation is expensive and labour intensive, the development of semi-automated text mining support is hindered by unavailability of training data. There have been no studies on how existing data sources (e.g. TF-related data from the MeSH thesaurus and GO ontology) or potentially noisy example data (e.g. protein-protein interaction, PPI) could be used to provide training data for identification of TF-contexts in literature. Results: In this paper we describe a text-classification system designed to automatically recognise contexts related to transcription factors in literature. A learning model is based on a set of biological features (e.g. protein and gene names, interaction words, other biological terms) that are deemed relevant for the task. We have exploited background knowledge from existing biological resources (MeSH and GO) to engineer such features. Weak and noisy training datasets have been collected from descriptions of TF-related concepts in MeSH and GO, PPI data and data representing non-protein-function descriptions. Three machine-learning methods are investigated, along with a vote-based merging of individual approaches and/or different training datasets. The system achieved highly encouraging results, with most classifiers achieving an F-measure above 90%. Conclusions: The experimental results have shown that the proposed model can be used for identification of TF-related contexts (i.e. sentences) with high accuracy, with a significantly reduced set of features when compared to traditional bag-of-words approach. The results of considering existing PPI data suggest that there is not as high similarity between TF and PPI contexts as we have expected. We have also shown that existing knowledge sources are useful both for feature engineering and for obtaining noisy positive training data. © 2008 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Machine Learning","University of Manchester"
