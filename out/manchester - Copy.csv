"High-Tech Workers, Management Strategy, and Globalization","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/high-tech-workers-management-strategy-and-globalization","Folz, J.","2008","Based on qualitative interviews with Seattle area high-tech workers, this chapter explores their positioning within and reaction to globalization processes. Looking especially as cost-cutting labor strategies of contingent employment, importation of foreign workers, and the outsourcing of professional high-tech work, it is argued that these are essentially restrictive employment strategies that benefit employers at the expense of employees. While some of the interviewees more or less approved of these practices as logical from the corporate perspective, and were confident that their jobs were too complex to be at risk, most are questioning these processes and some were actively trying to organize in an effort to halt or at least slow down such trends. How and why high-tech workers accommodate or resist management policies and practices they disagree with is analyzed with attention to the impact of ideology.","Tech","University of Manchester"

Oda Nobunaga was the first of three military leaders who all played leading roles in unifying Japan (the other two being Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu). For a long period of time, access to Banshōji was limited to members of Japan’s military and financial elites.As head priest Daitō Gen’yū explains in this video, only around twenty extended family households were affiliated as parishioners of Banshōji before he took office. His tenure marked the construction of “eternal memorial graves” (eitai kuyōbo), an innovative grave model that flourished in response to societal changes in Japan’s rapidly shrinking and aging society. This video introduces several of Banshōji’s indoor graves and shows how different graves represent different aesthetics, needs, and financial plans. Viewers will notice the importance placed on light and the material features involved in making religious beliefs and practices visible and tangible at Banshōji. ","Tech","University of Manchester"

"Learning strategies of high-tech entrepreneurs about business opportunities","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/learning-strategies-of-high-tech-entrepreneurs-about-business-opp","Fayena, I.; Nelson, A.; Rashman, L.; Rensburg, D. J. V.","3 Mar 2020","This two-phase, sequential mixed methods, utilising a qualitative, followed by a quantitative study was conducted with 178 high-tech entrepreneurs based in Israel. The study focuses on how entrepreneurs learn about business opportunities and explores the factors that affect the way they do it. A conceptual model is presented and then empirically tested. The results show that entrepreneurs learn strategically about business opportunities. Six learning strategies were identified as relevant to the process of opportunity identification. Prior knowledge of foreign markets was found as the most significant factor, while cognitive style was found to moderate the strength of the relationships between prior knowledge and the learning strategies. Entrepreneurs can benefit from these findings by recognising that they have a battery of learning strategies, which are relevant to the opportunity identification process. The identification of six learning strategies that are relevant to the process of opportunity identification is unique to this study.","Tech","University of Manchester"

"The productivity impact of R&D investment: are high-tech sectors still ahead?","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/the-productivity-impact-of-rampd-investment-are-high-tech-sectors","Ortega-Argilés, R.; Piva, M.; Vivarelli, M.","3 Apr 2015","Our aim is to investigate the relationship between a firm's R&D expenditures and its productivity, looking at sectoral peculiarities. We use a unique longitudinal database consisting of 1809 US and European manufacturing and service firms over the period 1990–2008. Our main findings can be summarised as follows. Consistently with previous literature, the knowledge stock has a significant positive impact on a firm's productivity. More interestingly, the coefficient turns out to be significantly larger in the R&D-user services and high-tech manufacturing sectors than in the non-high-tech manufacturing sectors. Contrary to the ‘latecomer advantage’ approach, these outcomes suggest that firms in high-tech sectors are still ahead in terms of impact on productivity of R&D investments.","Tech","University of Manchester"

"Is corporate R&D investment in high-tech sectors more effective?","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/is-corporate-rampd-investment-in-high-tech-sectors-more-effective","Ortega-Argilés, R.; Piva, M.; Potters, L.; Vivarelli, M.","18 Jun 2010","This paper discusses the link between R&D and productivity across the European industrial and service sectors. The empirical analysis is based on both the European sectoral OECD data and on a unique micro-longitudinal database consisting of 532 top European R&D investors. The main conclusions are as follows. First, the R&D stock has a significant positive impact on labor productivity; this general result is largely consistent with previous literature in terms of the sign, the significance, and the magnitude of the estimated coefficients. More interestingly, both at sectoral and firm levels the R&D coefficient increases monotonically (both in significance and magnitude) when we move from the low-tech to the medium- and high-tech sectors. This outcome means that corporate R&D investment is more effective in the high-tech sectors and this may need to be taken into account when designing policy instruments (subsidies, fiscal incentives, etc.) in support of private R&D. However, R&D investment is not the sole source of productivity gains; technological change embodied in gross investment is of comparable importance on aggregate and is the main determinant of productivity increase in the low-tech sectors. Hence, an economic policy aiming to increase productivity in the low-tech sectors should support overall capital formation.","Tech","University of Manchester"

"Making the Car “Platform Ready”: How Big Tech Is Driving the Platformization of Automobility","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/making-the-car-platform-ready-how-big-tech-is-driving-the-platfor","Hind, S.; Kanderske, M.; Vlist, F. V. D.","26 Jun 2022","“Big Tech” platform companies like Alphabet (Google), Apple, and Amazon are deeply invested in the future of automobility—from developing car-specific interfaces and self-driving technology to establishing business partnerships with automakers. Far from business-as-usual, we explain how Big Tech is reshaping the traditional automotive industry by making the car “platform ready,” as imposed on the web before it. The article considers how this novel transformation of automobility is increasingly significant for critical scholars of social media, platforms, and platformization, as bespoke forms of mediated, datafied, and platformized, sociality emerge. Specifically, we identify six levels upon which this platformization of automobility is unfolding and through which Big Tech is reorganizing the automotive industry according to platform logics concerning programmability, modularity, connectivity, data collection, and developmental partnerships. We do so by analyzing academic and technical literature, industry reports, and initiatives with a stake in platform automobility. Finally, we suggest directions for further research into Big Tech’s stake in the future of automobility, as these new dynamics begin to reshape the automotive industry at large.","Tech","University of Manchester"
