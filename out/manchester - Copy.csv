Computations agree well with experimental data of the bare rotor but indicate that three-dimensional unsteadiness means that a strictly 2-dimensional idealization produces too high lift and too low drag. The addition of discs, while leading toapparently negative drag coefficients, does not produce the striking rise in lift coefficients that Thom’s experiments had shown. Moreover, the great increase in torque coefficients associated with adding discs seemsto exclude their use in sea-going propulsion applications.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

S.; Wang, J.; Ruxton, T.; Yang, J. B.; Liu, J.","2004","Safety assessment based on conventional methods such as probability risk assessment (PRA) may not be well suited for dealing with innovative systems having a high level of uncertainty, particularly in the feasibility and concept design stages of a maritime engineering system. By contrast, safety models using fuzzy logic approaches employing fuzzy IF-THEN rules can model the qualitative aspects of human knowledge and reasoning processes without employing precise quantitative analyses. Fuzzy-logic-based approaches may be more appropriately used to carry out risk analysis in the initial design stages of large maritime engineering systems. This provides a tool for working directly with the linguistic terms commonly used in carrying out safety assessment. This paper focuses on the development and representation of linguistic variables to model risk levels subjectively. These variables are then quantified using fuzzy set theory. In this paper, the development of two safety evaluation frameworks using fuzzy logic approaches for maritime engineering safety-based decision support in the concept design stage are presented. An example is used to illustrate and compare the proposed approaches. Future risk analysis in maritime engineering applications may take full advantages of fuzzy logic approaches to complement existing ones.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.; Gunasekaran, A.; Tiwari, M. K.","8 Mar 2017","Maritime inventory routing problem is addressed in this paper to satisfy the demand at different ports during the planning horizon. It explores the possibilities of integrating slow steaming policy as mentioned in Kontovas et al. (2011) and Norstad et al. (2011) within ship routing. A mixed integer non-linear programming model is presented considering various scheduling and routing constraints, loading/unloading constraints and vessel capacity constraints. Non-linear equation between fuel consumption and vessel speed has been incorporated to capture the sustainability aspects. Several time window constraints are inculcated in the mathematical model to enhance the service level at each port. Penalty costs are incurred if the ship arrives early before the starting of the time window or if it finishes its operation after the ending of the time window. Costs associated with the violation of time window helps in maintaining a proper port discipline. Now, owing to the inherent complexity of the aforementioned problem, an effective search heuristics named Particle Swarm Optimization for Composite Particle (PSO-CP) is employed. Particle Swarm Optimization – Differential Evolution (PSO-DE), Basic PSO and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are used to validate the result obtained from PSO-CP. Computational results provided for different problem instances shows the superiority of PSO-CP over the other algorithms in terms of the solution obtained.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

After providing an ethnographic account of the contemporary place of the sea in local discourses of Hunchun’s identity, I draw on archival material to analyze the politico-linguistic history of maritime affairs in this part of China and beyond. I examine how the notion yang (ocean/foreign) transformed from being a label of foreign interventions in China to serving as a metaphor for domestic economic progress. The sea is both a distant dream and a source of concrete developmental potential for Hunchun today. It is also an optic through which to observe the town’s future.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

H.","1 Oct 2022","With the rise of global trade, maritime transportation networks have become an indispensable element of logistics networks. Approximately 80% of the global trade volume is transported by sea with the maritime logistics network fueling global economic integration. Due to the uncertainty of the transportation process and the impact of accidents, the reliability analysis of the logistics network is a topic of immense interest. In this paper, we propose an original and novel model to quantitatively analyze the vulnerability of the maritime logistics network by considering the importance of each port in the network. Three centrality measures that consider different topology information of the network are used in this paper to identify the importance of ports. Different information about the network is considered through the joint entropy and the multiscale factor  to evaluate the vulnerability of the logistics network. The Asia–Europe maritime transportation network serves as a real-world example to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed model. The experimental results suggest that the performance of the maritime network is closely related to the heterogeneity of the connectivity pattern and the process of decentralization can reduce the vulnerability of the maritime network.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Predicting climate change impacts on maritime Antarctic soils: A space-for-time substitution study","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/predicting-climate-change-impacts-on-maritime-antarctic-soils-a-s","Horrocks, C. A.; Newsham, K. K.; Cox, F.; Garnett, M. H.; Robinson, C. H.; Dungait, J. A. J.","Feb 2020","We report a space-for-time substitution study predicting the impacts of climate change on vegetated maritime Antarctic soils. Analyses of soils from under Deschampsia antarctica sampled from three islands along a 2,200 km climatic gradient indicated that those from sub-Antarctica had higher moisture, organic matter and carbon (C) concentrations, more depleted δ13C values, lower concentrations of the fungal biomarker ergosterol and higher concentrations of bacterial PLFA biomarkers and plant wax n-alkane biomarkers than those from maritime Antarctica. Shallow soils (2 cm depth) were wetter, and had higher concentrations of organic matter, ergosterol and bacterial PLFAs, than deeper soils (4 cm and 8 cm depths). Correlative analyses indicated that factors associated with climate change (increased soil moisture, C and organic matter concentrations, and depleted δ13C contents) are likely to give rise to increases in Gram negative bacteria, and decreases in Gram positive bacteria and fungi, in maritime Antarctic soils. Bomb-14C analyses indicated that sub-Antarctic soils at all depths contained significant amounts of modern 14C (C fixed from the atmosphere post c. 1955), whereas modern 14C was restricted to depths of 2 cm and 4 cm in maritime Antarctica. The oldest C (c. 1,745 years BP) was present in the southernmost soil. The higher nitrogen (N) concentrations and δ15N values recorded in the southernmost soil were attributed to N inputs from bird guano. Based on these analyses, we conclude that 5–8 °C rises in air temperature, together with associated increases in precipitation, are likely to have substantial impacts on maritime Antarctic soils, but that, at the rates of climate warming predicted under moderate greenhouse gas emission scenarios, these impacts are likely to take at least a century to manifest themselves.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.; Cox, F.; Sands, C. J.; Garnett, M. H.; Magan, N.; Horrocks, C. A.; Dungait, J. A. J.; Robinson, C.","1 Dec 2020","We report a previously undescribed member of the Helotiales that is superabundant in soils at two maritime Antarctic islands under Antarctic Hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica Desv.). High throughput sequencing showed that up to 92% of DNA reads, and 68% of RNA reads, in soils from the islands were accounted for by the fungus. Sequencing of the large subunit region of ribosomal (r)DNA places the fungus close to the Pezizellaceae, Porodiplodiaceae, and Sclerotiniaceae, with analyses of internal transcribed spacer regions of rDNA indicating that it has affinities to previously unnamed soil and root fungi from alpine, cool temperate and Low Arctic regions. The fungus was found to be most frequent in soils containing C aged to 1,000–1,200 years before present. The relative abundances of its DNA and RNA reads were positively associated with soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations and δ13C values, with the relative abundance of its DNA being negatively associated with soil pH value. An isolate of the fungus produces flask-shaped phialides with a pronounced venter bearing masses of conidia measuring 4.5–6(7) × 1.8–2.5 μm, suggestive of anamorphic Chalara. Enzymatic studies indicate that the isolate strongly synthesizes the extracellular enzyme acid phosphatase, and also exhibits alkaline phosphatase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase activities. Ecophysiological measurements indicate optimal hyphal growth of the isolate at a pH of 4.2–4.5 and a water potential of −0.66 MPa. The isolate is a psychrotroph, exhibiting measureable hyphal growth at −2°C, optimal hyphal extension rate at 15°C and negligible growth at 25°C. It is proposed that the rising temperatures that are predicted to occur in maritime Antarctica later this century will increase the growth rate of the fungus, with the potential loss of ancient C from soils. Analyses using the GlobalFungi Database indicate that the fungus is present in cold, acidic soils on all continents. We advocate further studies to identify whether it is superabundant in soils under D. antarctica elsewhere in maritime Antarctica, and for further isolates to be obtained so that the species can be formally described.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

We exploit this recurring natural experiment to estimate the effect that an exogenous change in the money supply has on the real economy. We find that negative money supply shocks caused Spanish real output to decline. A transmission channel analysis highlights slow price adjustments and credit frictions as channels through which money supply changes affected the real economy. Especially large output declines occurred in textile manufacturing against the backdrop of a credit crunch that impaired merchants’ ability to supply their manufacturers with inputs.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Divisions at sea: Class, gender, race, and nation in maritime films of the Second World War, 1939-60","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/divisions-at-sea-class-gender-race-and-nation-in-maritime-films-o","Summerfield, P.","Sep 2011","The configuration of the war at sea in the popular memory of the Second World War has been relatively neglected. In particular, historians have overlooked the division between the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. Yet portrayals of the two navies differed widely. Maritime films both during and after the war followed a well-established tradition of representing the navy as a force of disciplined and respectable men led by gentlemen heroes that reliably defended nation and empire. Such representations rarely acknowledged the existence of the Merchant Navy with its globally recruited and racially mixed workforce and its troubling associations with indiscipline. Yet naval operations largely concerned its protection, and the British war effort depended on the goods it transported. In the context of the leftward drift of wartime politics, the Merchant Navy received rare attention in a 1943 film that nevertheless avoided depicting non-white merchant seaman or disturbing the gender division. After the war the focus of maritime films returned to the Royal Navy. The liminal presence of the Merchant Navy in films of the 1950s was, however, significant. It was, variously, the vector for the expression of British insecurities about the wartime victory, the occasion for the portrayal of the enemy as an honourable foe, and a means to both romanticize, and hint at the fragility of, imperial masculinity. © The Author [2011].

Shifts in ownership from the state to private hands or pious foundations put further stress on the state’s traditional fiscal base. Christ argues that the sultans increased taxation and state intervention in response, and thus that control of the international transit trade turned out to be particularly profitable. In order to tap it more effectively, the Mamluk sultanate reinforced ties with the Venetians in the Mediterranean and the Rasulids in the Red Sea. Relations were grounded in an ambiguous language of gift exchange which allowed for the harmonization of nominal hierarchical difference and de facto bilateral, symbiotic exchange. On the basis of shared trade interests, the Mamluks delegated power over the ‘Two Seas’. This delegation was not perfect though; the Mamluks also sought to establish a direct if only seasonal fiscal presence in the Egyptian gateways of this trade in Alexandria, Upper Egypt and the Hijaz , thus combining delegation on the seas with tighter control in the ports in order to channel the lucrative transit trade through their Cairo power base.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The objective is to ensure continuity of operation at all sites by maintaining adequate inventory levels of all raw materials. We develop a novel multi-grid continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation based (Susarla, Li, & Karimi, 2010) for this chemical logistics problem. Our model allows limited jetties at each site, non-zero transfer times, variable load/unload quantities, transfer task sequencing, etc. In contrast to the literature, it needs no separate estimates for arrivals at each site. Several examples are solved to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed formulation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

L.","2020","In contrast to the situation in plants inhabiting most of the world’s ecosystems, mycorrhizal fungi are usually absent from roots of the only two native vascular plant species of maritime Antarctica, Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis. Instead, a range of ascomycete fungi, termed dark septate endophytes (DSEs), frequently colonise the roots of these plant species. We demonstrate that colonisation of Antarctic vascular plants by DSEs facilitates not only the acquisition of organic nitrogen as early protein breakdown products, but also as non-proteinaceous D-amino acids and their short peptides, accumulated in slowly-decomposing organic matter, such as moss peat. Our findings suggest that, in a warming maritime Antarctic, this symbiosis has a key role in accelerating the replacement of formerly dominant moss communities by vascular plants, and in increasing the rate at which ancient carbon stores laid down as moss peat over centuries or millennia are returned to the atmosphere as CO2.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Comparisons are made between the available experimental and LES data both for the bare cylinder, as employed in Flettner's notable Atlantic crossing, and the variant advocated by Thom in which close-packed discs are distributed along the cylinder. Our results display close agreement with available experimental and LES data other than the results of Thom (1934). We conclude that the addition of discs by the latter led, at the relatively low Reynolds numbers of his experiments, to the boundary layer on the cylinder being thinned to a point at which the boundary layers became laminar or transitional, thus leading to higher lift coefficients than pertain in turbulent flow. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This was made possible through use of a holographic instrument able to image cloud particles at very high resolution and small size (6 μm). The environment in which the observations were conducted was notable for the presence of desert dust advected over the ocean from the Sahara. However, there is no laboratory evidence to suggest that these dust particles can act as ice nuclei at temperatures warmer than about −10 ◦ C, the zone in which the first ice was observed in these clouds. The small ice particles were observed to grow rapidly by vapour diffusion, riming, and possibly through collisions with supercooled raindrops, causing these to freeze and potentially shatter. This in turn leads to the further production of secondary ice in these clouds. Hence, although the numbers of primary ice particles are small, they are very effective in initiating the rapid glaciation of the cloud, altering the dynamics and precipitation produc- tion processes.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Organic aerosol above a tropical rainforest located in Danum Valley, Borneo, Malaysia, a high isoprene emission region, was studied during Summer 2008 using Aerosol Mass Spectrometry and offline detailed characterisation using comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography. Observations indicate that a substantial fraction (up to 15% by mass) of atmospheric sub-micron organic aerosol was observed as methylfuran (MF) after thermal desorption. This observation was associated with the simultaneous measurements of established gas-phase isoprene oxidation products methylvinylketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR). Observations of MF were also made during experimental chamber oxidation of isoprene. Positive matrix factorisation of the AMS organic mass spectral time series produced a robust factor which accounts for an average of 23% (0.18μgm-3), reaching as much as 53% (0.50 μgm-3) of the total oraganic loading, identified by (and highly correlated with) a strong MF signal. Assuming that this factor is generally representative of isoprene SOA, isoprene derived aerosol plays a significant role in the region. Comparisons with measurements from other studies suggest this type of isoprene SOA plays a role in other isoprene dominated environments, albeit with varying significance. © 2011 Author(s).","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Therefore, transportation ferries must be watched closely by local maritime administrators, which involves much manpower. With the use of historical data, this article proposes an intelligent method of integrating artificial potential field with Bayesian Network to trigger deviation warnings for a ferry based on its trajectory, speed and course. More specifically, a repulsive potential field-based model is first established to capture a customary waterway of ferries. Subsequently, a method based on non-linear optimisation is introduced to train the coefficients of the proposed repulsive potential field. The deviation of a ferry from the customary route can then be quantified by the potential field. Bayesian Network is further introduced to trigger deviation warnings in accordance with the distribution of deviation values, speeds and courses. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by the historical data of a chosen ferry on a specific route. The testing results show that the approach is capable of providing deviation warnings for ferries accurately and can offer a practical solution for maritime supervision.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

M.; Mingham, C. G.; McLean, D. A.; Bandar, Z.

The methods most commonly used for the prediction of time-averaged overtopping volumes are parametric regression and numerical modelling. In this paper overtopping volumes are predicted using artificial neural networks. This approach is inherently non-parametric and accepts data from a variety of structural configurations and sea-states. Two different types of neural network are considered: multi-layer perceptron networks and radial basis function networks. It was found that the radial basis function networks considerably outperform both the multi-layer perceptron networks and the curve-fitting (parametric regression) regime, and approach bespoke numerical simulations in accuracy. Unlike numerical simulation, the neural network approach gives generic prediction across a range of structures and sea-states and therefore incurs considerably less computational cost.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Whether trading wool across the Channel to Europe, seeking spices in South Asia or importing sugar from the Caribbean, shipping was an essential resource. Yet, to undertake these trades, merchants required naval supplies – finished ships, timber to build them and stores to fill them – that were not always easily accessible. This challenge was particularly apparent in the early seventeenth century for trading corporations whose specific needs demanded innovative approaches to the naval supply problem. This article examines the responses of English corporations to the challenge of supplying its international shipping by focusing on activities on each side of the Atlantic. First, it assesses the development of the East India Company’s docks at Blackwall and Dundaniel, before turning to a detailed study of ship-building and supply in Virginia and New England. In doing so, this article highlights the importance of naval supply to Britain’s north Atlantic empire, both in terms of the rhetorical support for empire and the economic incentives of participants. This reveals how traditional interpretations of Britain’s naval development have too often focused on state-driven activities (particularly from the very end of the seventeenth century) and failed to examine the complex, sometimes chaotic attempts by private individuals and corporations to overcome the naval supply challenges common to this early period of globalisation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The numerical model requires two adjustable parameters: the bed friction coefficient and a wave breaking parameter. Excellent agreement was achieved between the numerical predictions of solitary wave transformation and run-up at a plane beach with two sets of high-quality laboratory measurements: one a large number of experiments in a wave flume by Synolakis, the other in the UK Coastal Research Facility. A parameter study investigated the effect of uniform offshore water depth, bed friction and bed slope on solitary wave run-up. A uniform water depth may be associated with a continental shelf region. The non-dimensional run-up was found to be an asymptotic function of non-dimensional wave amplitude at high and low values of initial wave steepness. Both asymptotes scale as (R/ho) ∼ α(Ao/h o)β where R is run-up (defined as the vertical elevation reached by the wave uprush above still water level), Ao is the offshore wave amplitude and ho is the uniform depth offshore of the beach. The empirical coefficients α and β depend on the beach characteristics. The model is then used to simulate the interaction of a full-scale tsunami event with an idealised beach profile representative of a beach in Eastern Kamchatka.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Furthermore, evidence collected through a survey instrument addressed to shipping companies located in Greece suggests that the choice of MCS is contingent upon the strategy pursued by the shipping companies. Moreover, this paper tests whether shipping companies with an optimal fit between their strategies and their MCS experience superior business performance and a higher perceived usefulness of MCS.

This article argues that it is therefore unsurprising that the sea also impacted on copper workers in the southern Aegean during the Early Bronze Age. Here, the sea was an integral element of the copper production, which is characterized by movement of metal across the sea from one manufacturing stage to the next—often over considerable distances requiring lengthy absences of the workers from their home communities, making metalworkers true maritime specialists alongside the more “typical” traders, fishermen, and seafarers. The distances traveled magnified the symbolic value of the raw materials as the object’s geographic distance became converted into a symbolic value-added “exotic” distance. This value was further enhanced thanks to the mastery of skills required to traverse the sea, an element very different from land and intimately associated with forgetting, disposal, and death.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Based on the marked reduction in seafood consumption after the Mesolithic and the use of marine creatures in funerary iconography in the post-palatial period, it becomes apparent that the sea-then as now-is an inherently ambiguous medium that captures both positive and negative emotions.

K.","4 Dec 2017","This research addresses the sustainability and safety related challenges associated with the complex, practical, and real-time maritime transportation problem, and proposes a multiobjective mathematical model integrating different shipping operations. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is formulated considering different maritime operations, such as routing and scheduling of ships, time window concept considering port's high tidal scenario, discrete planning horizon, loading/unloading operation, carbon emission from the vessel, and ship's draft restriction for maintaining the vessel's safety at the port. The relationship between fuel consumption and vessel speed optimization is included in the model for the estimation of the total fuel consumed and carbon emission from each vessel. Time window concept considered in the problem aims to improve the service level of the port by imposing different penalty charges associated with the early arrival of the vessel before the starting of the time window and vessel failing to finish its operation within the allotted time window. Another practical aspect of the maritime transportation such as high tide scenario is included in the model to depict the vessel arrival and departure time at a port. Two novel algorithms-Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Multiobjective particle swarm optimization have been applied to solve the multiobjective mathematical model. The illustrative examples inspired from the real-life problems of an international shipping company are considered for application. The experimental results, comparative, and sensitivity analysis demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The AVEXIS submersible vehicle used in this study has been designed as a low-cost, potentially disposable, inspection platform that is the smallest of its class and is capable of being deployed through a 150 mm diameter access pipe. To map the gamma-ray environment, a cerium bromide scintillator detector with a small form factor has been incorporated into the AVEXIS to identify radioactive isotopes via gamma-ray spectroscopy. This provides the combined system with the potential to map gamma-ray spectra and particle locations throughout submerged, contaminated facilities, such as Units 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The hypothesis of this research is to determine the sensitivity of the combined system in a submerged environment that replicates the combination of gamma radiation and water submersion but at lower dose rates.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Mixed radiation fields of this type can arise in the context of reactor accidents via, for example, 137Cs (gamma) and 244Cm (neutrons). However, performance degradation of such scintillators, such as EJ-301, is a significant possibility that might limit the use of this technology in accident response applications. The premise behind the high dose rate testing of such a liquid scintillator described in this paper is for fuel debris characterisation at Fukushima Daiichi, which has expected dose rates of up to 1000 Gy/hr in close proximity to fuel debris. The tests carried out for this investigation involved using the 60Co gamma irradiation facility at the Dalton Cumbria Facility, Cumbria, United Kingdom to expose the detector to a similar dose rate to that which is estimated within the primary containment vessel for survivability tests. Radiation hardness tests have rarely been reported for such devices and it is expected that the performance will be dependent on the survival of the window of the photomultiplier tube rather than the liquid scintillant itself. A major advantage of the use of this detector is its physical size, due to the limitations on access into Fukushima reactors physical space is a premium. The research described in this paper presents the results of the dose rate exposure of the detector before signal was lost with the total dose observed providing information on any degradation affecting the performance of the device post-irradiation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The complexity of the global shipping system makes predicting volumes and patterns of long-term future international maritime trade a challenging task which is best explored by building scenarios rather than ‘precise’ forecasts. We present four contrasting scenarios of international maritime trade out to 2050, available in high resolution in terms of the dimensions studied (regions, countries, commodities, decades), which are consistent with high and low levels of global CO2 mitigation and associated climate impacts. The scenarios project trade increasing to between two and four times the 2010 value by 2050. Scenarios characterised by low temperature increases and material intensity lead to the lower bound trade increase with high trade growth in bioenergy commodities. Unfettered production growth across countries, high temperature increases and material intensity lead to a quadrupling of trade across energy, containerised, dry and wet commodities. The estimated range is lower than those in existing scenarios and forecasts in which globalisation is assumed to continue apace. The scenarios which project the highest growth presupposes both limited decarbonisation (in contrast to the Paris Agreement) and continued growth in expanding markets. The scenarios therefore become a valuable policy and decision-making tool to address technological and operational change required of the shipping sector, if it is to deliver mitigation in line with the Paris Agreement.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The precise location of the debris is not known, for example as to whether it remains within the reactor pressure vessel or it has leaked through into the base of the pedestal below. Additionally, the state of the fuel is also in question as to whether this has evolved from within its cladding or if it is intact. The most likely scenario is a combination of all four of these situations. The flooding of the reactor floors immediately following the Fukushima accident adds an extra element of complexity for the detection system, for example requiring it to be submersible and to hold any detector system in water-tight confinement. The research carried out has involved extensive modifications to a previously-designed, low-cost, small-scale AVEXIS submersible inspection vehicle and the incorporation of a variety of radiation detectors. The latter has been designed to allow for mapping and determination of the situation that is present within the primary containment vessels. The challenges addressed with the detection system arise from the high dose rates that have been recorded around the reactor pressure vessels which can be as high as 1000 Gy/hr. In such a harsh environment not only will the radiation detectors struggle to operate but the components that make up the remote-operated vehicle are also likely to suffer radiation damage after only a relatively short period of time. The research presented here evaluates the components comprising the AVEXIS system in terms of their radiation tolerability as well as presenting the combination of detectors to be used in the remote probe for the investigation of the fuel debris.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This article assesses the risk levels of bearing and gearbox, which are the most sensitive components of the ship crane using fuzzy rule–based judgement for common elements and their sources. This will provide the ship crane operators with a means to predict possible impending failure without having to dismantle the crane. Furthermore, to monitor the rate of wear in gearbox and bearing of a ship crane, the ship crane reliability, and a trend to provide an operational baseline of data that will help the engineers to detect abnormal wear rates as they develop, is established. Within the scope of this research, a risk assessment model is developed for determining the risk levels of a crane’s components and recommending solutions using all the diagnostic capability obtainable for effective condition monitoring of the gearbox and bearing in ship cranes.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

As such, refugees are now crossing waters that have become extended sovereign borders. This is manifest in increased maritime surveillance to prevent refugees arriving by boat and landing on Europe’s and Australia’s shores. In this context, materially and symbolically, lighthouses mark out the space between the sea and land and in so doing, delimit these territorial and maritime borders. Although the function of the lighthouse is to warn those at sea of the dangers on the coastline, steering them away from coastal hazards and guiding them through a safe passage, for many sea travellers it can also represent the safety of the land, of arrival. This paper explores the ambiguous roles and effects of lighthouses; uniquely placed as sentinel posts along the coast they can aid military surveillance and control while at the same time enabling humanitarian assistance. It explores these conflicting functions focusing on how the lighthouse, as a border between land and sea, simultaneously protects and excludes offering beacons of hope as well as signalling danger. The paper draws on the arrival of refugees at Korakas lighthouse on the Greek island of Lesvos to illuminate these variable functions.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Emphasis is placed on characterizing ice particle shapes in Tropical Maritime and Mid‐Latitude Continental anvil cirrus, as well as in cirrus formed in situ in the upper troposphere, and subvisible cirrus in the upper tropical troposphere layer. There is a distinctive difference in cirrus ice particle shapes formed in situ compared to those in anvils that are generated in close proximity to convection. More than half the mass in cirrus formed in situ are rosette‐shapes (polycrystals and bullet rosettes). Cirrus formed from fresh convective anvils is mostly devoid of rosette‐shaped particles. However, small frozen drops may experience regrowth downwind of an aged anvil in a regime with RHice > ~ 120%, and then grow into rosette shapes. Identifiable particle shapes in Tropical Maritime anvils that have not been impacted by continental influences typically contain mostly single plate‐like and columnar crystals and aggregates. Mid‐Latitude Continental anvils contain single rimed particles, more and larger aggregates with riming, and chains of small ice particles when in a highly electrified environment. The particles in subvisible cirrus are < ~ 100 μm and quasi‐spherical with some plates and rare trigonal shapes.

In doing so, we scrutinize how notions of urban resilience, climate adaptation, and ecosystem-based infrastructure are influencing contemporary planning practice. Our account from New Orleans and the Mississippi River Delta traces several large-scale hydrological engineering projects with origins in the early 20th century, which aimed to restructure the landscape for more effective maritime transportation, flood protection, and urban drainage. The account then turns to a discussion of a massive and ongoing planning project, which aims to restore the historical dynamics of the Mississippi River Delta, diverting the river into nearby coastal wetlands to provide storm protection for vulnerable communities, most especially New Orleans. Our analysis shows how the development of water infrastructure systems in the region produced cleavages in the region's body politic and eco-hydrology, generating disputes that threaten to slow or obstruct the plan's implementation. The study shows how the forms and discourses of political contention in the present are deeply informed by past decisions regarding the placement, operation, and maintenance of water infrastructures in the region. The conflicts that emerge from these cleavages comprise the primary obstacle facing ecosystem-based strategies aimed at securing New Orleans and other major settlements in the region from storm surges. This raises fundamental challenges for planning practice, which are explored here through a discussion of situational dissensus, conflicting rationalities, and pathways for democratic institutional innovation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Glaciers were much larger and more numerous during the Little Ice Age. Small glaciers even existed as far south as the High Atlas of Morocco and the Sierra Nevada of southern Spain. In more northerly areas, such as the western Balkans, glaciers and permanent snow fields occupied hundreds of cirques on relatively low-lying mountains.

K. R.; Gunasekaran, A.; Subramanian, N.; Tiwari, M. K.","8 Apr 2016","Ship routing and scheduling problem is considered to meet the demand for various products in multiple ports within the planning horizon. The ports have restricted operating time, so multiple time windows are taken into account. The problem addresses the operational measures such as speed optimisation and slow steaming for reducing carbon emission. A Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model is presented and it includes the issues pertaining to multiple time horizons, sustainability aspects and varying demand and supply at various ports. The formulation incorporates several real time constraints addressing the multiple time window, varying supply and demand, carbon emission, etc. that conceive a way to represent several complicating scenarios experienced in maritime transportation. Owing to the inherent complexity, such a problem is considered to be NP-Hard in nature and for solutions an effective meta-heuristics named Particle Swarm Optimization-Composite Particle (PSO-CP) is employed. Results obtained from PSO-CP are compared using PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and GA (Genetic Algorithm) to prove its superiority. Addition of sustainability constraints leads to a 4-10% variation in the total cost. Results suggest that the carbon emission, fuel cost and fuel consumption constraints can be comfortably added to the mathematical model for encapsulating the sustainability dimensions.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

J.","2005","A survey of available mass-balance data shows that glaciers on arctic islands, i.e. mountain glaciers and ice caps in northern Canada, Greenland, Svalbard and the Eurasian islands, share mass-balance characteristics of low annual amplitude and small interannual variability. By contrast, glaciers around the Arctic (e.g. in Alaska, Iceland, mainland Scandinavia and northern Eurasia) can have exceptionally large annual amplitude and interannual variability but otherwise share characteristics with glaciers in lower latitudes. The arctic island glaciers occur in areas with low annual precipitation and high annual temperature variability, i.e. in dry-cold or continental regions. Most glaciers surrounding the Arctic (Alaska, Iceland and Scandinavia) occur in areas with high annual precipitation and low annual temperature variability, i.e. in wet-warm or maritime regions. Earlier mass-balance modelling showed that arctic island glaciers have low sensitivity to temperature changes consistent with their low mass-balance amplitude. However, very large changes in mass balance could occur on arctic island glaciers if the sea ice surrounding the arctic islands were reduced so that the climate of the arctic islands becomes more maritime.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

L.","Apr 2011","For the past 50 years there has been rapid warming in the maritime Antarctic, with concurrent, and probably temperature-mediated, proliferation of the two native plants, Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) and especially Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica). In many terrestrial ecosystems at high latitudes, nitrogen (N) supply regulates primary productivity. Although the predominant view is that only inorganic and amino acid N are important sources of N for angiosperms, most N enters soil as protein. Maritime Antarctic soils have large stocks of proteinaceous N, which is released slowly as decomposition is limited by low temperatures. Consequently, an ability to acquire N at an early stage of availability is key to the success of photosynthetic organisms. Here we show that D. antarctica can acquire N through its roots as short peptides, produced at an early stage of protein decomposition, acquiring N over three times faster than as amino acid, nitrate or ammonium, and more than 160 times faster than the mosses with which it competes. Efficient acquisition of the N released in faster decomposition of soil organic matter as temperatures rise may give D. antarctica an advantage over competing mosses that has facilitated its recent proliferation in the maritime Antarctic. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Using numerical simulation and experimental results it is shown that the content of stator current frequency spectrum of a CRIM, when subject to a stator fault, is highly dependent on the machine's pole pairs/rotor bars number combination. This characteristic results in the appearance of fault specific frequencies in the machine stator current spectrum for a well defined subset of CRIMs. The identified fault specific frequencies may be used for the unambiguous detection of stator failures.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Because the poor suffer the most from that crisis, diakonia, which considers looking after the poor as one of its concerns, can play a critical role. However, instead of focusing exclusively on human interest, this article seeks to conceptualise diakonia as a ministry that has concerns for all creatures whose lives rely on the sea, and the sea itself. I begin with integrating the marine ecological crisis into diakonia by engaging with theological discourses on diakonia to suggest that such an integration is plausible and necessary. This integration leads to a discussion on the emerging discourse of eco-diakonia to argue that the sea should be a recipient of diakonia. Then, based on the encounter between a Christian theology of diakonia and traditional maritime cultures of Indonesia navigated by a Trinitarian pneumatology of creation, I proceed further to argue that the sea should also be perceived as diakonos. These arguments constitute the concept of ‘blue diakonia’: a ministry that acknowledges and supports the sea as an active participant in the Trinitarian Spirit’s work by feeding the poor and giving life to all creatures.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The rapid overseas expansion of European nations began with the maritime centre which Henry the Navigator established at Sagras in Portugal. Four centuries later other searchers after new areas of exploitation-Nasmyth, Bessemer, Stephenson-had immense effect on the growth of the new steam-powered industries and dependent businesses. And so it has gone on ever since-to the development of the new transistor in the Bell Laboratories in 1947, to Alistair Pilkington's invention of float glass in 1952 and beyond. As Denis Loveridge shows in this article, these and many similar revolutionary inventions depend on personal endurance for their successful completion, while their widespread adoption has repercussions over many decades, making it imperative for industries to look ahead. Foresight in this context needs to adopt a wider view than simply that of technological optimism; what is needed is business built on the philosophy of wisdom, on the concept of value, which embraces the wider issues of business and creates achievable visions for its future. © 1988.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This would be achieved by seeding, with copious quantities of seawater cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), low‐level maritime stratocumulus clouds covering these regions or those at the source of incoming currents. Higher cloud droplet density would increase these clouds' reflectivity to incoming sunlight, and possibly their longevity. This approach is therefore a more localized application of the marine cloud brightening (MCB) geoengineering technique promoting global cooling. By utilizing a climate ocean/atmosphere coupled model, HadGEM1, we demonstrate that—subject to the satisfactory resolution of defined but unresolved issues—judicious seeding of maritime stratocumulus clouds might significantly reduce sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in regions where hurricanes develop. Thus artificial seeding may reduce hurricane intensity; but how well the magnitude of this effect could be controlled is yet to be determined.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.","9 Jul 2019","This paper endeavors to explore the sustainable container shipping problem considering fuel bunker management and provide adequate recovery policies for countering disruption within maritime transportation. This paper addresses the environmental concerns related to fuel consumption and carbon emission within shipping operations and simultaneously presents strategies for countering disruption within the maritime transportation domain. Several studies addressed bunker fuel management strategies, but overlooked the need for integrating it with shipping operations. This paper aims to bridge this research gap by proposing a novel mathematical model and presenting a heuristic procedure combined with a variable neighborhood search algorithm for maximizing the shipping company's profitability, while addressing the vessel routing and scheduling decisions, container loading and unloading operations, selection of bunkering ports, and determining bunkered amount for heavy fuel oil and marine diesel oil. Recovery strategies such as port swapping and rescheduling of vessel route are considered to deal with disruptions related to weather adversities. An illustrative example is presented depicting the realistic scenario and providing results associated with ship routes, vessel speed, bunkering ports, bunkered amounts, fuel consumed by the vessel on each sailing leg, arrival and departure time of the ships, etc. Insights obtained from the analysis performed based on the fuel price, ship's bunkering capacity, adverse weather conditions on various routes, port closure, carbon tax, and fuel consumption provide useful information for shipping company managers. Managerial implications are presented with regard to the impact of fuel prices and carbon tax on shipping operation from the perspective of overall operational cost. Moreover, the results provide important policy insights for shipping company managers in terms of possessing alternate vessel route options for normal scenario and disrupted scenarios including weather adversities on sailing leg or port closure.

The results suggest strongly that a simple relationship exists between droplet effective radius and liquid water content in layer clouds with the droplet effective radius proportional to the cube root of the liquid water content. The constant of proportionality is different over oceans and continents. In current global climate models liquid water content is not a predicted variable in convective clouds, and the data strongly suggest that a fixed value of droplet effective radius between 9 and 10 mum should be used for continental clouds more than 500 m deep and 16 mum for maritime cumulus more than 1.5 km deep.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

We measured the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), amino acids and inorganic N in soils under these two vascular plant species, and under mosses and lichens, over a growing season at Signy Island in the maritime Antarctic. We recorded higher concentrations of nitrate, total dissolved nitrogen, DOC, DON and free amino acids in soil under D. antarctica and C. quitensis than in lichen or moss dominated soils. Each vegetation cover gave a unique profile of individual free amino acids in soil solution. Significant interactions between soil type and time were found for free amino acid concentrations and C/N ratios, indicating that vascular plants significantly change the temporal dynamics of N mineralization and immobilization. We conclude that D. antarctica and C. quitensis exert a significant influence over C and N cycling in the maritime Antarctic, and that their recent population expansion will have led to significant changes in the amount, type and rate of organic C and N cycling in soil. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

L.","Jul 2018","Ice volume during the last ten 100 ka glacial cycles was driven by solar radiation flux in the northern hemisphere. Early minima in solar radiation combined with critical levels of atmospheric CO2 drove initial glacier expansion. Glacial cycles between MIS 24-13, whilst at 100 ka periodicity, were irregular in amplitude and the shift to the largest amplitude 100 ka glacial cycles occurs after MIS 16. Mountain glaciers in the mid-latitudes and Asia reached their maximum extents early in glacial cycles then retreated as global climate became increasingly arid. In contrast, larger ice masses close to maritime moisture sources continued to build-up and dominated global glacial maxima reflected in marine isotope and sea-level records. The effect of this pattern of glaciation on the state of the global atmosphere is evident in dust records from Antarctic ice cores where pronounced double peaks in dust flux occur in all of the last eight glacial cycles. Glacier growth is strongly modulated by variations in solar radiation, especially in glacial inceptions. This external control accounts for ~50-60% of ice volume change through glacial cycles. Internal global glacier-climate dynamics account for the rest of the change which is controlled by the geographical distributions of glaciers. ","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Using original scenarios, this paper demonstrates for the first time that it is possible for a nation's shipping to make a fair contribution to meeting global climate change commitments, but that this requires transformation of the sector. The scale and nature of technology change varies depending on the level of demand and how this is satisfied. The scenarios show that to develop successful marine mitigation policy, it is essential to consider the interdependencies between ship speed, level and pattern of demand for services, and the extent and rate of innovation in propulsion technology. Across the scenarios, it is difficult to foresee how deep decarbonisation can be achieved without an immediate, fleet-wide speed reduction; and a land-based energy-system transition strongly influences shipping demand, which in turn, influences the extent of required low-carbon propulsion technology change. Setting the industry on a 2 °C heading requires multifaceted and near-term changes in the shipping sector, but these are unlikely to materialise without a major shift by stakeholders to realise new and innovative deep decarbonisation policies in the coming decade.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The δ13C values are typical of carbonates precipitating in an open lake system with the exception of samples from the very uppermost parts of these sequences which have values more typical of palustrine or tufaceous carbonates and, therefore, indicate the progressive contraction and shrinkage of the lake system overtime. The δ18O values record an initial increase to an early peak at the onset of the Holocene but a subsequent decline in values of such a magnitude that by ca 8000 yrs B.P. the δ18O value of the precipitated carbonate is consistent with carbonates that precipitated at the end of the Loch Lomond Stadial. The early increase and peak in δ18O values is suggested to reflect the climatic amelioration at the onset of the Holocene, as temperatures progressively rose. The decline cannot be explained by any known temperature shifts, however, this “depletion trend” is seen in several other early Holocene lacustrine records from across the British Isles. This decline is suggested to reflect a shift in the seasonality of precipitation from a more seasonal precipitation regime typical of a “continental” climate, with strong seasonal contrasts in rainfall, to a more “maritime” climate which was characterised by consistent levels of rainfall occurring across the year. The relative timing of human activity at Star Carr suggests human occupation occurred after this isotopic decline under “maritime” rather than “continental” climates.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

J.; Zhang, Y.; Raper, S.","2001","The sensitivity of global sea level to increased melting of mountain glaciers and ice caps under warmer temperatures is estimated. This involves estimating the temperature sensitivity of glacier mass balance for grid squares containing glaciers, multiplying by the appropriate glacier area, and summing over all grid squares with glacier cover, excluding Greenland and Antarctica. The temperature sensitivity of mass balance for each grid square is calculated from precipitation in a gridded climatology using a relationship based on degree day modelling for 61 individual glaciers. Smaller mass balance sensitivities occur for dry cold (continental) glaciers and larger sensitivities for warm-wet (maritime) glaciers. The globally averaged mass balance sensitivity is -0.41 m a-1 deg-1 in good agreement with the value found earlier by J. Oerlemans. The global sea level sensitivity is 0.62 to 0.81 mm a 1 deg 1, depending on which value is used for global glacier area.

To support the elicitation of basic probability assignment (BPA), numerous uncertainty measures have been proposed in the recent decades, which take into account nonspecificity and structural conflict (SC) in either the entropy-alike or nonentropy form. This article is focused primarily on developing a generalized belief entropy to measure and quantify the uncertainty of BPA in a consistent and comprehensive way. The definition of the proposed belief entropy involves three components. Specifically, the first component is Shannon's definition of entropy of probability functions which can be interpreted as the measure of discord of the mass function among various focal elements. The second component is the measure of total nonspecificity which is the generalization of Dubois-Prade's definition of nonspecificity measure. Furthermore, the critical component introduced in this article is the utilization of the SC coefficient within an evidence, which fully considers the intersection between each pair of focal elements of the BPA. The characteristics and properties of the new generalized belief entropy are analyzed systematically with theoretical proofs. Finally, the proposed belief entropy is embedded to a three-tuple approach to deal with a practical multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problem to demonstrate its validity and strengths of measuring nonspecificity and SC in uncertain decision making.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

J.; Heymsfield, A. J.; Choularton, T. W.","Oct 2006","A modelling study is presented to look at the potential importance of ice multiplication in a deep Cb cloud observed during the second Egrett Microphysics Experiment with Radiation, Lidar and Dynamics (EMERALD-II). Simulations with both a cloud-resolving model (CRM) and an explicit-microphysics model (EMM) are used. The CRM has a two-moment bulk microphysics scheme and resolved cloud dynamics, while the EMM has detailed size-resolved microphysics, but is driven by the CRM cloud dynamics. The simulations consider the sensitivity of the storms to the rime-splinter, secondary ice production mechanism (or Hallett-Mossop process). Recent literature on modelling this process in Cb clouds suggests that it is of low importance to the cloud glaciation in intense storms. However, until now, numerical simulations in the literature have investigated this process by either switching it on or off in the model microphysics scheme. We show that if the rate of splinter production is doubled from that proposed by Hallett and Mossop's experiment - a reasonable factor - then for this simulated model cloud, there is a large direct impact on anvil glaciation. The approximate net radiative impact of this calculated with the CRM is 10Wm-2. Similar, 'nonlinear' results can also be expected from other ice nucleating mechanisms. Simulations are performed for both continental and maritime cloud condensation nuclei concentrations. In stark contrast to previous literature, we find that the Hallett-Mossop process is more important in the continental ('polluted') case than in the maritime ('clean') case. This is because of the extremely warm cloud base for this particular storm and consequently - because of the rapid production of rain - the scarcity of small cloud droplets for riming in the clean case. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2006.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

How to cope with consistency and consensus under uncertain circumstance are two critical issues in pairwise comparison based GDM problems. In this paper, we firstly propose the model of complete interval distributed preference relation (CIDPR) based on the concept of linguistic distribution with interval symbolic proportions, distribution linguistic preference relation (DLPR) and IDPR. Secondly, the additive consistency index of CIDPR is defined to measure the consistency level of expert’s judgment, and an adjustment algorithm is proposed for converting inconsistent CIDPR to an acceptable consistent level. Thirdly, since trust relation is a critical factor in the generation of experts’ weights and the adjustment of experts’ opinions, consensus reaching process (CRP) is designed to take into account distributed linguistic trust relations under social network analysis (SNA). In the proposed adjustment mechanism, non-consensus individual should modify opinion towards his/her trusted and highly weighted expert. The advantage of the proposed inconsistent CIDPR adjustment model can maximally retain the information in the original distribution, while the CRP has a relatively fast convergent speed and good practicality. An illustrative example of strategic new product selection is conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method and its potential in supporting realistic GDM problems.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

E.; Roberts, M. J.; Garcia-Carreras, L.; Ackerley, D.; Reeder, M. J.; Lock, A. P.; Schiemann, R.","2015","There are some long-established biases in atmospheric models that originate from the representation of tropical convection. Previously, it has been difficult to separate cause and effect because errors are often the result of a number of interacting biases. Recently, researchers have gained the ability to run multiyear global climate model simulations with grid spacings small enough to switch the convective parameterization off, which permits the convection to develop explicitly. There are clear improvements to the initiation of convective storms and the diurnal cycle of rainfall in the convection-permitting simulations, which enables a new process-study approach to model bias identification. In this study, multiyear global atmosphere-only climate simulations with and without convective parameterization are undertaken with the Met Office Unified Model and are analyzed over the Maritime Continent region, where convergence from sea-breeze circulations is key for convection initiation. The analysis shows that, although the simulation with parameterized convection is able to reproduce the key rain-forming sea-breeze circulation, the parameterization is not able to respond realistically to the circulation. A feedback of errors also occurs: the convective parameterization causes rain to fall in the early morning, which cools and wets the boundary layer, reducing the land-sea temperature contrast and weakening the sea breeze. This is, however, an effect of the convective bias, rather than a cause of it. Improvements to how and when convection schemes trigger convection will improve both the timing and location of tropical rainfall and representation of sea-breeze circulations.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

M.; Cardwell, J.","Oct 1996","The properties of the ice phase in a number of cloud types are investigated to improve the ice phase parametrization in atmospheric global-climate models. Frontal clouds over southern England and the sea areas around the British Isles, maritime convective clouds over the North Atlantic, and continental convective clouds over New Mexico and Montana in the USA are studied. Ice concentrations are seen to be several orders of magnitude higher than those which could be attributed to primary nucleation of ice nuclei at cloud-top temperatures. Thus secondary ice multiplication processes must be operating in each cloud type. Evidence suggests that the process of ice splinter production during riming, the Hallett-Mossop process which operates at temperatures around -6 °C, is the dominant mechanism operating. The data analysed are parametrized as phase ratios, the fraction of cloud condensed water found in the liquid phase, and the variation of this phase ratio with temperature is examined. The greatest differences are observed between frontal and convective clouds, although smaller differences between continental and maritime clouds of the same type are also seen. In general, frontal clouds possess very high fractions of ice across a wide range of temperature. In contrast, convective clouds exhibit a wide range of phase ratio across the whole temperature range observed. These differences are attributed to the greater vertical wind velocities present in convective clouds. These parametrizations have been used in the UK Meteorological Office Global Climate Model. They are valid for clouds which span the Hallett-Mossop splinter-production temperature range.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Increased precipitation is predicted under current climate change projections, which will put further pressure on urban populations and infrastructure. Roof greening can be used within flood mitigation schemes to restore the urban hydrological balance of cities. Intensive green roofs, with their deeper substrates and higher plant biomass, are able to retain greater quantities of runoff, and there is a need for more studies on this less common type of green roof which also investigate the effect of factors such as age and vegetation composition. Runoff quantities from an aged intensive green roof in Manchester, UK, were analysed for 69 rainfall events, and compared to those on an adjacent paved roof. Average retention was 65.7% on the green roof and 33.6% on the bare roof. A comprehensive soil classification revealed the substrate, a mineral soil, to be in good general condition and also high in organic matter content which can increase the water holding capacity of soils. Large variation in the retention data made the use of predictive regression models unfeasible. This variation arose from complex interactions between Antecedant Dry Weather Period (ADWP), season, monthly weather trends, and rainfall duration, quantity and peak intensity. However, significantly lower retention was seen for high rainfall events, and in autumn, which had above average rainfall. The study period only covers one unusually wet year, so a longer study may uncover relationships to factors which can be applied to intensive roofs elsewhere. Annual rainfall retention for Manchester city centre could be increased by 2.3% by a 10% increase in intensive green roof construction. The results of this study will be of particular interest to practitioners implementing greenspace adaptation in temperate and cool maritime climates. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This work represents the most comprehensive evaluation of oceanic OM emission inventories to date, by employing aerosol composition measurements obtained from campaigns with wide spatial and temporal coverage. The model underestimates AOD over the remote ocean on average by 0.02 (21 %), compared to satellite observations, but provides an unbiased simulation of ground-based Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations. Comparison with cruise data demonstrates that the GEOS-Chem simulation of marine sulfate, with the mean observed values ranging between 0.22 μg mg-3 and 1.34 μg m-3, is generally unbiased, however surface organic matter (OM) concentrations, with the mean observed concentrations between 0.07 μg mg-3 and 0.77 μg mg -3, are underestimated by a factor of 2-5 for the standard model run. Addition of a sub-micron marine OM source of approximately 9 TgC yr -1 brings the model into agreement with the ship-based measurements, however this additional OM source does not explain the model underestimate of marine AOD. The model underestimate of marine AOD is therefore likely the result of a combination of satellite retrieval bias and a missing marine aerosol source (which exhibits a different spatial pattern than existing aerosol in the model). © 2011 Author(s).","Maritime","University of Manchester"

In situ measurements were made in the outflow from maritime thunderstorms near Kwajalein, part of the Marshall Islands and of thunderstorms with more continental aerosol concentrations both in the United States and near Darwin, Australia over the Tiwi Islands. Images of chain-like aggregates of small ice crystals, some with plate-like shapes were observed with a state-of-the-art microphysics probe in the outflow regions of continental storms that were typically highly electrified, displaying lightning. The 'chains' were not found in the outflow regions of maritime storms that are typically less electrically active. The striking similarity between these images and previous laboratory measurements of ice aggregation in electric fields are remarked upon. This evidence is used to support the theory that chain aggregates of ice crystals may be common in fully glaciated regions of continental thunderstorms, where ice-particle number densities are high, and their presence is due to the electric field alignment of ice crystals with subsequent enhancement of the aggregation process by dipole induction resulting in short-range attractive inter-particle forces. It is not confirmed where in the storm the aggregates were typically formed; however, in the Darwin thunderstorms they were noted to occur with the highest frequency towards the cirrus outflow base when the cirrus base altitude was high, and generally decreased in frequency with increasing distance from the storm. The potential consequences of electrically enhanced aggregation in continental storms and related electric field mechanisms along with the role of homogeneous freezing in intense thunderclouds are discussed. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2005.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

While finding resonance with claims that the hierarchical, state-dominated provision of policing has been uprooted by a move toward a more polycentric, networked mode of governance (Shearing & Wood, 2003; Brodeur, 2010), it is suggested that the emerging security network along the Welsh coastline serves to enhance the policing and surveillance functions of the state. By co-ordinating otherwise disparate institutions, the policing initiative aspires to incorporate a range of agents and agencies in the crime control complex.

This model uses temperature and precipitation to calculate snow accumulation, snow and ice melting, and possible refreezing of meltwater at regular altitude intervals on a glacier. Model parameters are still somewhat uncertain and are established for individual glaciers by tuning the model mass balance as a function of altitude to fit observed data. The model has been applied to 37 glaciers in different parts of the world so far and some details are given for Storglaciaren to illustrate the approach. The sensitivity of modelled mass balance to a +1°C temperature increase shows a wide range for the 37 glaciers from about 0.1 to 1.3 m water a-1.

Initially, the probability of a monitoring target being a real moving vessel is estimated using the records of manual operations and the Evidential Reasoning (ER) rule. Subsequently, the bridges, piers and other encountering vessels in a waterway are characterized as collision potential fields using an Artificial Potential Field (APF) model, and the corresponding coefficients can be trained in terms of the historical vessel distributions. As a result, the positional collision potential of any monitoring vessel can be obtained through overlapping all the collision potential fields together. The probabilities of authenticity and the collision potential are further formulated as two pieces of evidence on which the Dempster’s rule of combination is used to reason the collision probability of a monitoring target. The vessels associated with high collision probabilities can be highlighted for supervisors’ attention, as they potentially pose high risks to safety.

For the first time, a lidar network monitored continent-scale haze air masses for several years (since 2000).

The particle optical depth and PBL height increased with increasing distance from the North Atlantic. Mean summer PBL heights were 1.9-2.8 km at the continental sites of Leipzig, Belsk, and Minsk.

The standard deviation of net balance is strongly correlated with the mass-balance amplitude (half the difference between winter and summer balances) for 60 glaciers, so the amplitude can be estimated from net balance standard deviation for the other 55 glaciers where winter and summer balances are unavailable. The observed and calculated mass-balance amplitudes for the 115 glaciers show contrasts between the Arctic and lower latitudes, and between maritime and continental regions. The interannual variability of mass balance means that balances must be measured for at least a few years to determine a statistically reliable mean balance for any glacier. The net balance of the Greenland ice sheet is still not accurately known, but its standard deviation is here estimated to be about ±0.24 m a-1, in agreement with other Arctic glaciers. Mass-balance variability of this magnitude implies that the ice sheet can thicken or thin by several metres over 20-30 years without giving statistically significant evidence of non-zero balance under present climate.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

We verify the tuned model by comparing modelled accumulation with winter balance where this has been measured (presently for 180 glaciers). The modelled accumulation naturally depends upon the vertical lapse rate (VLR) for temperature and the degree-day factor (DDF) for snowmelt. Both are somewhat uncertain in high-mountain areas, but modelled accumulation and measured winter balance are in reasonable agreement for most glaciers. The degree-day model predicts a non-linear relation between accumulation and summer temperature at the ELA as assumed by many workers, but we find a family of curves rather than a single universal curve. Maritime glaciers with low annual temperature range have proportionally more accumulation than continental glaciers with high annual temperature range for a similar summer mean temperature. Averages of winter balance for the five main geographical regions where mass-balance data are available agree well with annual accumulation from the degree-day model.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Design, Setting, and Participants A 2×2 factorial phase 3 randomized clinical trial among 320 patients requiring pleurodesis in 16 UK hospitals from 2007 to 2013. Interventions Patients undergoing thoracoscopy (n = 206; clinical decision if biopsy was required) received a 24F chest tube and were randomized to receive opiates (n = 103) vs NSAIDs (n = 103), and those not undergoing thoracoscopy (n = 114) were randomized to 1 of 4 groups (24F chest tube and opioids [n = 28]; 24F chest tube and NSAIDs [n = 29]; 12F chest tube and opioids [n = 29]; or 12F chest tube and NSAIDs [n = 28]). Main Outcomes and Measures Pain while chest tubewas in place (0-to100-mmvisual analog scale [VAS] 4 times/d; superiority comparison) and pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months (failure defined as need for further pleural intervention; noninferiority comparison; margin, 15%). Results Pain scores in the opiate group (n = 150) vs the NSAID group (n = 144) were not significantly different (mean VAS score, 23.8mmvs 22.1 mm; adjusted difference,-1.5 mm; 95%CI,-5.0 to 2.0 mm; P =.40), but the NSAID group required more rescue analgesia (26.3%vs 38.1%; rate ratio, 2.1; 95%CI, 1.3-3.4; P =.003). Pleurodesis failure occurred in 30 patients (20%) in the opiate group and 33 (23%) in the NSAID group, meeting criteria for noninferiority (difference,-3%; 1-sided 95%CI,-10% to; P =.004 for noninferiority). Pain scores were lower among patients in the 12F chest tube group (n = 54) vs the 24F group (n = 56) (mean VAS score, 22.0mmvs 26.8 mm; adjusted difference,-6.0 mm; 95%CI,-11.7 to-0.2 mm; P =.04) and 12F chest tubes vs 24F chest tubes were associated with higher pleurodesis failure (30% vs 24%), failing to meet noninferiority criteria (difference,-6%; 1-sided 95%CI,-20% to P =.14 for noninferiority). Complications during chest tube insertion occurred more commonly with 12F tubes (14%vs 24%; odds ratio, 1.91; P =.20). Conclusions and Relevance Use of NSAIDs vs opiates resulted in no significant difference in pain scores but was associated with more rescue medication. NSAID use resulted in noninferior rates of pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months. Placement of 12F chest tubes vs 24F chest tubes was associated with a statistically significant but clinically modest reduction in pain but failed to meet noninferiority criteria for pleurodesis efficacy.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

J.","2008","Several authors relate accumulation (or precipitation) at the glacier equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) to summer mean temperature using exponential or power-law functions. I analyze the accumulation-temperature relation at the ELA with a degree-day model using data from the 1992 paper by A. Ohmura and others. The dataset includes estimates at the ELA of winter balance and of 'winter balance plus summer precipitation' which represent respectively low and high estimates of annual accumulation, which is seldom measured. The Ohmura dataset only lists summer mean temperature, but I recover monthly temperatures for the whole year for 66 of the glaciers by assuming sinusoidal temperature variation through the year and using annual temperature range from a gridded climatology. Monthly degree-day sums are then estimated from monthly mean temperature and summed to give annual totals so degree-day factors for melting snow at the ELA are obtained. The degree-day factors fall close to those reported in the literature for glacier snowmelt, with averages of 3.5 ± 1.4 and 4.6 ± 1.4 mm d-1 K-1 for low- and high-accumulation estimates on the 66 glaciers. The degree-day model gives a family of accumulation-temperature curves that depend upon the annual temperature range, representing the contrast between maritime and continental climates.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Algal filaments have been observed growing within the matrix of a polymer sealant. Growth has been observed tunnelling within and adhered to the surface of the sealant. This degradation mechanism will weaken the material bond as a direct result of the physical activity of an organism, resulting from its growth. Loss of material, either through biodeterioration or through other mechanical means, such as tidal action, is not the primary cause of degradation, but it should be considered with associated environmental conditions, to exacerbate the condition.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Current arguments favour the latter. However, significant last glacial ice-rafted debris (IRD) exists in NW Pacific ocean cores, which must have been sourced from a major ice sheet somewhere bordering the North Pacific. The origin of this IRD is addressed through a combination of marine core analysis, iceberg trajectory modelling and remote sensing of glacial geomorphology. We find compelling evidence for two stages of glaciation centred on the Kamchatka area of maritime southeast Russia during the last glacial, with ice extent intermediate in size between previous maximum and minimum reconstructions. Furthermore, a significant increase in iceberg flux precedes, and accompanies, a substantial marine core ash deposit at around 40 ka BP. We speculate that rapid decay of the first stage of the ice sheet may have triggered substantial volcanic activity.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The principal sources of NOx emissions in Galicia and their associated uncertainty have been calculated in this paper. The results prove that industrial and mobile sources produce 90% of the emissions, principally due to road transport, power and cogeneration plants. Use of fertilizers or fuels for residential purposes, burning of agricultural waste, soils, fires and lightning are minor sources of emissions. In the case of fires, in regions specially affected like Galicia, attention must be paid to variations in number and type of burnt areas from one year to another, because it can significantly change total NOx emissions. The emissions produced by agricultural, fishery and forest vehicles and machines as well as by maritime and railway traffic are the main focus of uncertainty due to the lack of specific data for Galicia like type, age and power of the machines. Other important focuses of uncertainties are the emissions from soils and fires owing to the absence of a more specific methodology.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.; Garnett, M. H.; Robinson, C. H.; Cox, F.","18 May 2018","Different organic compounds have distinct residence times in soil and are degraded by specific taxa of saprotrophic fungi. It hence follows that specific fungal taxa should respire carbon of different ages from these compounds to the atmosphere. Here, we test whether this is the case by radiocarbon (14C) dating CO2 evolved from two gamma radiation-sterilised maritime Antarctic soils inoculated with pure single cultures of four fungi. We show that a member of the Helotiales, which accounted for 41–56% of all fungal sequences in the two soils, respired soil carbon that was aged up to 1,200 years BP and which was 350–400 years older than that respired by the other three taxa. Analyses of the enzyme profile of the Helotialean fungus and the fluxes and δ13C values of CO2 that it evolved suggested that its release of old carbon from soil was associated with efficient cellulose decomposition. Our findings support suggestions that increases in the ages of carbon respired from warmed soils may be caused by changes to the abundances or activities of discrete taxa of microbes, and indicate that the loss of old carbon from soils is driven by specific fungal taxa.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The regions are: Axel Heiberg Island in Arctic Canada; Svalbard; northern Scandinavia; southern Norway; the Alps; the Caucasus; and New Zealand. We estimate the average equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) for each half-degree latitude/longitude grid square from the median elevations of glaciers within the square and we extrapolate temperature from the UEA/CRU (Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia) gridded climatology. Using the degree-day model, we calculate annual accumulation at the ELA, equal to ablation at the ELA, and other quantities like summer mean temperature, length of melt season, balance gradients and the sensitivity of mass balance to temperature and/or precipitation changes. Glaciers can be characterized on a scale from cold-dry (Axel Heiberg Island) to warm-wet (New Zealand) corresponding to the contrast between maritime and continental climates. Mass-balance sensitivities to temperature and/or precipitation changes are relatively small for dry-cold climate and relatively high for warm-wet climate. We could extend the approach to other glacier regions but we note that there are large areas for which ELA data are not available as they are still not covered by the World Glacier Inventory.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

However, all engineered barriers can degrade and subsystems can interact in a complex manner, which can make it challenging to assess how close a system is to a dangerous failure overall. Analyses after major incidents often show – with the benefit of hindsight – that a number of ‘weak signals’ of impending disaster were present, but these were only useful when analysed holistically.
In early 2018, the "Discovering Safety" programme was launched. This programme is being delivered through the Thomas Ashton Institute and combines the strengths of the Health & Safety Executive and the University of Manchester and is supported and funded by Lloyd’s Register Foundation. The programme addresses occupational safety issues together with process safety and allied technical safety topics. The focus of this programme is on using new data analysis techniques to extract valuable intelligence that will enable the prevention and mitigation of accidents, and improve 'plateaued' safety performance. A key project within the programme is the "Loss of Containment Insights" project. The project aims to create a source of intelligence by using data analytical tools on HSE's existing datasets relating to onshore loss of containment events and their precursors.
This paper outlines the stakeholder interactions which led to the development of the project, the approach taken, strengths and weaknesses of RAMS intelligence in the process sector and elsewhere and then proposals for next steps together with summary findings from data analysis carried out in 2018/19. A key goal surrounding the publication of the paper is to gain constructive feedback from process industry specialists to ensure that the project is successful and the outputs useful to industry.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The open source software Fire Dynamics Simulator with Evacuation (FDS+EVAC), used in building egress analyses, was adapted to include these behavioural and event information such as familiarity with ship layout, ship rotation and lifeboats boarding. Simulation results on the case study confirmed similarities between ships and buildings evacuations, underlining the effectiveness of wayfinding solutions to improve passengers’ evacuation flows and routes selection.

Of 78 near-cloud regions analyzed, 68% and 45% had enhanced volumes of submicron particles and supermicron particles, respectively. In addition, 35% of these regions had supermicron particles removed, presumably by precipitation. In 61% of the cases the enchancement in volume occurred over the size range from 0.1 to 50 μm whereas only submicron volumes were enhanced in 35% of the cases. In regions near clouds that were formed in air of maritime origin the frequency of volume enhancement decreased with increasing altitude and was twice as frequent on the dissipating side of clouds compared to the growing side. No such differences were found in the regions near clouds formed in air originating from the land. The frequency and average magnitude of volume enhancement are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with previous observational and theoretical studies that relate enhancements in particle mass to the uptake by cloud droplets of SO2 accompanied by additional growth by droplet coalescence. © 2005 Author(s).

Actions to reduce its emissions are therefore an important element of global efforts to combat climate change. This article re-assesses the international shipping sector’s initial greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets against the Paris Agreement goals. The analysis is based upon the latest data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and International Maritime Organization (IMO) and uses the concept of carbon budgets to evaluate proportionate 1.5°C emissions pathways for the sector. The consequences of the resulting Paris-compliant pathways for shipping’s existing mitigation targets and strategy are discussed. The article concludes that significantly stronger short- and longer-term targets need to be set for the sector to be compatible with the Paris Agreement’s goals: 34% reductions on 2008 emissions levels by 2030, and zero emissions before 2050, compared with the sector’s existing target of a 50% cut in CO by 2050. Crucially, strengthening the target by the IMO’s strategy revision date of 2023 is imperative. The long asset lifetimes of ships and shipping infrastructure limit the speed of transition such that a delay of even a few years will dictate an untenable rate of decarbonization and increased risk of pushing the already challenging Paris goals out of reach","Maritime","University of Manchester"

C. B.; Braithwaite, R. J.","2009","Glacier volume response time is a measure of the time taken for a glacier to adjust its geometry to a climate change. It has been previously proposed that the volume response time is given approximately by the ratio of glacier thickness to ablation at the glacier terminus. We propose a new conceptual model of glacier hypsometry (area-altitude relation) and derive the volume response time where climatic and topographic parameters are separated. The former is expressed by mass balance gradients which we derive from glacier-climate modelling and the latter are quantified with data from the World Glacier Inventory. Aside from the well-known scaling relation between glacier volume and area, we establish a new scaling relation between glacier altitude range and area, and evaluate it for seven regions. The presence of this scaling parameter in our response time formula accounts for the mass balance elevation feedback and leads to longer response times than given by the simple ratio of glacier thickness to ablation at the terminus. Volume response times range from decades to thousands of years for glaciers in maritime (wet-warm) and continental (dry-cold) climates respectively. The combined effect of volume-area and altitude-area scaling relations is such that volume response time can increase with glacier area (Axel Heiberg Island and Svalbard), hardly change (Northern Scandinavia, Southern Norway and the Alps) or even get smaller (The Caucasus and New Zealand). © 2009 Author(s).","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Accordingly, any significant shift in the size and shape of the global energy system has important consequences for shipping, which underpins international trade and supports economic development. The Paris Agreement requires an acceleration of the drive towards energy system decarbonisation. Yet, the International Maritime Organisation’s understanding of the future is more in line with the high-carbon scenarios analysed here. This paper is a first comprehensive and global assessment of implications of fundamental changes to global and regional energy systems for international shipping, under-researched in energy scenarios consistent with deep decarbonisation. It concludes that, despite uncertainties (particularly with negative emission technologies), fossil fuel trade by the middle of the century will almost certainly be significantly lower under low-carbon than under high-carbon scenarios, and (for oil and coal) lower than in 2012. As to bioenergy and captured carbon dioxide, while their supply is expected to increase during a low-carbon transition, worldwide shipped trade in these commodities will not necessarily grow, based on the analysis in this paper. In other words, if the low-carbon futures envisioned in the Paris Agreement materialise, energy-related shipping will likely decline (by a quarter for oil and by 50% for coal in the median <2°C scenarios by 2050), with significant ramifications for policies and regulation in the shipping sector and international trade","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This means that the system includes automated parameter selection and operator advice and guidance. Central to this knowledge-enhanced framework is an encyclopedia that is used to store all information pertaining to the current system operation and can be used by all of the imaging modules and computational runtime components.

Here we report on marine aerosols (PM1) over the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, in terms of their physical, chemical, and cloud droplet activation properties. Two predominant pristine air masses and aerosol populations were encountered: modified continental Antarctic (cAA) comprising predominantly sulphate with minimal sea-salt contribution and maritime Polar (mP) comprising sulphate plus sea-salt. We estimate that in cAA air, 75% of the CCN are activated into cloud droplets while in mP air, 37% are activated into droplets, for corresponding peak supersaturation ranges of 0.37–0.45% and 0.19–0.31%, respectively. When realistic marine boundary layer cloud supersaturations are considered (e.g. ~0.2–0.3%), sea-salt CCN contributed 2–13% of the activated nuclei in the cAA air and 8–51% for the marine air for surface-level wind speed < 16 m s−1.

D.; Woodward, J. C.","Sep 2008","Recent research in the mountains of the Mediterranean has attempted to establish the timing of the maximum extent of glaciers during the last cold stage. Several dating methods have been utilised and new dating frameworks have emerged in key areas. In several places, multiple dating techniques (radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence, U-series) applied to glacial and associated sediments suggest that local glacier maxima preceded the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 18 14C ka BP/21 cal. ka BP) by at least several thousand years. Studies in Spain, the Pyrenees, the Maritime Alps and Turkey utilising cosmogenic isotope analyses (10Be and 36Cl), have yielded glacial geochronologies with maxima that correlate closely with the marine isotope record of ice volume and the global LGM. In some cases, the use of different geochronological techniques has led to conflicting evidence for the timing of the local last glacier maxima in the same area. From a palaeoclimate perspective, glacier-climate reconstructions for the local last glacier maxima in the mountains of central Italy, northern Greece and western Turkey indicate that climate was wet and cold. In Italy and Greece the local glacier maxima preceded the driest part of the last cold stage - as indicated by palaeoecological records - by several thousand years. For western Turkey, however, recent cosmogenic exposure ages combined with glacier modelling suggest a local last glacier maximum characterised by cold and wet conditions coinciding with the global LGM. The available evidence indicates that a dichotomy is emerging, not only in our understanding of the timing of glaciation across the Mediterranean, but also in the palaeoclimatic interpretations derived from glacial and palaeoecological records.

Marked variations in the large scale structure of the cloud field were observed during the experiment on both day-to-day and on diurnal timescales. In the remote maritime region the model is shown to have a good representation of synoptically induced variability in both cloud cover and marine boundary layer depth. Satellite observations show a strong diurnal cycle in cloud fraction and liquid water path in the stratocumulus with enhanced clearances of the cloud deck along the Chilean and Peruvian coasts on certain days. The model accurately simulates the phase of the diurnal cycle but is unable to capture the coastal clearing of cloud. Observations along the 20° S latitude line show a gradual increase in the depth of the boundary layer away from the coast. This trend is well captured by the model (typical low bias of 200 m) although significant errors exist at the coast where the model marine boundary layer is too shallow and moist. Drizzle in the model responds to changes in liquid water path in a manner that is consistent with previous ship-borne observations in the region although the intensity of this drizzle is likely to be too high, particularly in the more polluted coastal region where higher cloud droplet number concentrations are typical. Another mode of variability in the cloud field that the model is unable to capture are regions of pockets of open cellular convection embedded in the overcast stratocumulus deck and an example of such a feature that was sampled during VOCALS-REx is shown. © 2010 Author(s).","Maritime","University of Manchester"

S.","Jun 2005","The main objective of this paper is to propose a framework for modelling, analysing and synthesizing system safety of engineering systems or projects on the basis of a generic rule-based inference methodology using the evidential reasoning (RIMER) approach. The framework is divided into two parts. The first one is for fuzzy rule-based safety estimation, referred to as a fuzzy rule-based evidential reasoning (FURBER) approach. The second one is for safety synthesis using the evidential reasoning approach. In the FURBER framework, parameters used to define the safety level, including failure rate, failure consequence severity and failure consequence probability are described using fuzzy linguistic variables; a fuzzy rule base designed on the basis of a belief structure is used to capture uncertainty and nonlinear relationships between these three parameters and the safety level; and the inference of the rule-based system is implemented using the evidential reasoning algorithm. Then the following steps involve synthesizing safety at higher levels of an engineering system to integrate all possible causes to a specific technical failure, or estimates made by a panel of experts. The synthesis is also based on the evidential reasoning approach. The final step describes the analysis and interpretation of the final synthesized safety of a system. The above framework has been applied to modelling system safety of an offshore and marine engineering system: the floating production storage offloading (FPSO) system. A series of case studies of collision risk between a FPSO and a shuttle tanker due to technical failure during a tandem offloading operation is used to illustrate the application of the proposed model.

M.; Choularton, T. W.; Inglis, D. W. F.; Dore, A. J.; Fowler, D.","May 2003","Long-term monitoring of rain and cloud water has been carried out at a high level site within the urban plume downwind of Manchester in north-west England. Samples have been taken weekly at Holme Moss. The site experiences significant orographic cloud cover, resulting in enhancement of rainfall volume via the seeder-feeder process. Samples are analysed for major ions, with the results being interpreted in the light of the effects of the seeder-feeder enhancement and reductions in UK emissions of pollutants. Rainfall volume enhancement is dependent on the spatial and temporal extent of orographic cloud at the site, with resultant consequences on ionic strength in the samples. Large rainfall amounts are associated with longer cloud duration and lower cloud base. Rain passing through the cloud scavenges proportionately more larger droplets, resulting in relatively lower ionic concentration. Coupled with increased washout upwind, this limits the amount of deposition, with some ions showing a decrease in deposition at high rainfall amounts. Clear downward trends are seen in sulphate concentration in rain and cloud water, with both emissions reduction and the dilution effect of increasing rainfall being responsible. Less significant downward trends are observed for nitrate, although this is in line with national patterns of deposition. Deposition at Holme Moss for all ions is dominated by the prevailing, predominantly maritime, southwesterly airflow, although for non-marine ions there are significant contributions from the industrial areas of Yorkshire to the east, and to a lesser extent the Birmingham conurbation to the south. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

(ii) A subsequent "heat low" phase which coincided with a marked and rapid westward shift in the Saharan heat low towards its mid-summer climatological position and advection of a deep hot, dusty air layer from the central Sahara (the "Saharan residual layer"). This transition affected the entire western-central Sahara. Dust advected over SS2 was primarily from episodic low-level jet (LLJ)-generated emission in the northeasterly flow around surface troughs. Unlike Fennec SS1, SS2 does not often experience cold pools from moist convection and associated dust emissions. The diurnal evolution at SS2 is strongly influenced by the Atlantic inflow (AI), a northwesterly flow of shallow, cool and moist air propagating overnight from coastal West Africa to reach SS2 in the early hours. The AI cools and moistens the western Saharan and weakens the nocturnal LLJ, limiting its dust-raising potential. We quantify the ventilation and moistening of the western flank of the Sahara by (i) the large-scale flow and (ii) the regular nocturnal AI and LLJ mesoscale processes.

They are (1) a safety based decision support system using artificial neural network techniques, (2) a safety optimisation framework using Taguchi concepts, and (3) a multiple criteria decision approach applied to safety and cost synthesis. Such approaches provide the safety analyst with more flexibility and may be more appropriate in situations where satisfactory results cannot be obtained using other methods. A risk estimation framework incorporating artificial neural networks (ANNs) is described with two case studies demonstrating its use. Some suggestions are made for further research and development on ANN techniques in the context of maritime safety assessment. The possibility to pool records on notation fields such as system data, function information and casualty or defect data in an agreed and standardised database structure is discussed. A safety optimisation framework using the Taguchi concepts is described with an example demonstrating its use. The Taguchi concepts are described and discussed. Orthogonal arrays are used to study multiple parameters simultaneously with a minimum of time and resources to produce an overall picture for more detailed safety based design and operational decision making. The signal-to-noise ratio is employed to measure quality, in this case, risk level. The outcomes produced using the described framework may provide the fundamental knowledge for safety analysts to make safety based design and operation decisions. A new safety and cost modelling approach is described and demonstrated by an example. Three typical multiple criteria decision analysis methods for safety and cost synthesis are described. Their potential for use in safety base decision making is discussed. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This study proposed a novel technique to enhance hydration and carbonation at both the exterior and core sections of RMC concrete via a synergistic combination of microbial carbonation process (MCP) with nucleation seeding (S). The production of CO32− ions via the introduction of urease-producing bacteria to catalyze the hydrolysis of urea enabled self-carbonation of RMC, leading to the formation of HMHCs under ambient conditions. Improvements in CO2 dissolution and formation of brucite with a low crystallinity further stimulated HMHC formation under accelerated carbonation conditions. The simultaneous use of MCP and S resulted in dense microstructures composed of HMHCs with improved morphologies, translating into strengths that were >3 times of the control (62 vs 20 MPa).","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The strength of this aerosol–cloud model is in its ability to explicitly resolve all the known modes of heterogeneous cloud droplet activation and ice crystal nucleation. The model links cloud particle activation with the aerosol loading and chemistry of seven different aerosol species. These improvements to the model resulted in more accurate prediction especially of droplet and ice crystal number concentrations in the upper troposphere and enabled the model to directly sift the aerosol indirect effects based on the chemistry and concentration of the aerosols. In addition, continental and maritime cases were simulated for the purpose of validating the aerosol–cloud model and for investigating the critical microphysical and dynamical mechanisms of aerosol indirect effects from anthropogenic solute and solid aerosols, focusing mainly on glaciated clouds. The simulations showed that increased solute aerosols reduced cloud particle sizes by about 5 μm and inhibited warm rain processes. Cloud fractions and their optical thicknesses were increased quite substantially in both cases. Although liquid mixing ratios were boosted, there was however a substantial reduction of ice mixing ratios in the upper troposphere owing to the increase in snow production aloft. These results are detailed in the subsequent parts of this study.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

V.; Nunn, A. J.; Davies, R. J. O.","11 Aug 2011","BACKGROUND: More than 30% of patients with pleural infection either die or require surgery. Drainage of infected fluid is key to successful treatment, but intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy did not improve outcomes in an earlier, large, randomized trial. METHODS: We conducted a blinded, 2-by-2 factorial trial in which 210 patients with pleural infection were randomly assigned to receive one of four study treatments for 3 days: double placebo, intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and DNase, t-PA and placebo, or DNase and placebo. The primary outcome was the change in pleural opacity, measured as the percentage of the hemithorax occupied by effusion, on chest radiography on day 7 as compared with day 1. Secondary outcomes included referral for surgery, duration of hospital stay, and adverse events. RESULTS: The mean (±SD) change in pleural opacity was greater in the t-PA-DNase group thanin the placebo group (-29.5±23.3% vs. -17.2±19.6%; difference, -7.9%; 95% confidenceinterval [CI], -13.4 to -2.4; P = 0.005); the change observed with t-PA alone and with DNase alone (-17.2±24.3 and -14.7±16.4%, respectively) was not significantly differentfrom that observed with placebo. The frequency of surgical referral at 3 months was lower in the t-PA-DNase group than in the placebo group (2 of 48 patients [4%] vs. 8 of 51 patients [16%]; odds ratio for surgical referral, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.87; P = 0.03) but was greater in the DNase group (18 of 46 patients [39%]) than in the placebo group (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.30 to 9.75; P = 0.01). Combined t-PA-DNase therapy was associated with a reduction in the hospital stay, as compared with placebo (difference, -6.7 days; 95% CI, -12.0 to -1.9; P = 0.006); the hospital stay with either agent alone was not significantly different from that with placebo. The frequency of adverse events did not differ significantly among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intrapleural t-PA-DNase therapy improved fluid drainage in patients with pleural infection and reduced the frequency of surgical referral and the duration of the hospital stay. Treatment with DNase alone or t-PA alone was ineffective.

Aircraft and ozonesonde field measurements weretaken in two phases - the first in November/December 2005 to study pre-monsoondeep convection (so-called Hector storms over the Tiwi Islands off the northern coast)and the second in January/February 2006 to study monsoon convection. In both phasesACTIVE collaborated with two other simultaneous international campaigns at Darwin- the EU SCOUT-O3 project in November/December and the US/Australian TWP-ICEproject during the monsoon period. For ACTIVE, the high altitude Australian Egrettaircraft and lower altitude NERC Airborne Research and Survey Facility (ARSF),Dornier-228 aircraft were employed to measure chemical and aerosol species in theinflow and outflow of tropical storms. This paper discusses the inflow climatology ofsuch species, which include aerosol size and composition, CO, O3, VOCs and CFCs,measured at low altitude (less than 10000 ft) by the Dornier as a function of the evolvinglocal and regional meteorology. The chemical and aerosol background is seen tobe strongly delineated by changes in the prevailing meteorology, as well as by singularevents such as the influence of inland biomass burning. In general, we observe fourcontrasting periods to the background convective inflow: the first of which consists of arelatively polluted and highly variable biomass-burning period throughout November,followed by a second, less variable, moderately polluted phase throughout December,characterised by regular deep convection in the afternoon over the Tiwi Islands andfrequent large-scale squall lines over the Darwin area in both cases. The third and forthphases include a very clean active (and inactive) monsoon period throughout Januaryand a monsoon break period in February, during which the boundary layer backgroundshows a slow return to a more pre-monsoon state. The climatologies presented herewill provide a useful dataset of the Darwin region and a valuable resource for modelsimulation of chemical and aerosol transport by deep convection in the region, andhence links to improved understanding of TTL composition and dynamics.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

In thinking through the fate and transformations of French Colonial Week, from an outdoor public spectacle, to a pale replica of Empire-Day school celebrations (Journée scolaire de la France d’Outre-mer), I will focus on two aspects specific to cyclical vectors of pro-Empire propaganda in Europe more broadly: the transnational context within which they developed between the wars, and their recursive nature. After an account of the event’s foreign origins, devolved organisational model and regionally-inflected public celebratory practices, I will examine more closely the two most enduring and wide-reaching traditions that it produced: the Colonial-Week radio broadcasts and school campaigns. Reading La Semaine coloniale française through this comparative and diachronic framework, I will reflect on social, political and logistic reasons why it never coalesced into as ritualised and widely-observed a festival as Empire Day in Britain.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This study synthesises selected aircraft, ship and surface site observations from VOCALS-REx to statistically summarise and characterise the atmospheric composition and variability of the Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) and Free Troposphere (FT) along the 20Â° S parallel between 70Â° W and 85Â° W. Significant zonal gradients in mean MBL sub-micron aerosol particle size and composition, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and ozone were seen over the campaign, with a generally more variable and polluted coastal environment and a less variable, more pristine remote maritime regime. Gradients in aerosol and trace gas concentrations were observed to be associated with strong gradients in cloud droplet number. The FT was often more polluted in terms of trace gases than the MBL in the mean; however increased variability in the FT composition suggests an episodic nature to elevated concentrations. This is consistent with a complex vertical interleaving of airmasses with diverse sources and hence pollutant concentrations as seen by generalised back trajectory analysis, which suggests contributions from both local and long-range sources. Furthermore, back trajectory analysis demonstrates that the observed zonal gradients both in the boundary layer and the free troposphere are characteristic of marked changes in airmass history with distance offshore ĝ€" coastal boundary layer airmasses having been in recent contact with the local land surface and remote maritime airmasses having resided over ocean for in excess of ten days. Boundary layer composition to the east of 75Â° W was observed to be dominated by coastal emissions from sources to the west of the Andes, with evidence for diurnal pumping of the Andean boundary layer above the height of the marine capping inversion. Analysis of intra-campaign variability in atmospheric composition was not found to be significantly correlated with observed low-frequency variability in the large scale flow pattern; campaign-average interquartile ranges of CO, SO2 and O3 concentrations at all longitudes were observed to dominate over much smaller differences in median concentrations calculated between periods of different flow regimes. The campaign climatology presented here aims to provide a valuable dataset to inform model simulation and future process studies, particularly in the context of aerosol-cloud interaction and further evaluation of dynamical processes in the SEP region for conditions analogous to those during VOCALS-REx. To this end, our results are discussed in terms of coastal, transitional and remote spatial regimes in the MBL and FT and a gridded dataset are provided as a resource. © 2011 Author(s).","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Two spectroscopic techniques Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) and Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS), together with a glass coil/Hantzsch reaction/fluorescence technique, were employed for measurements of atmospheric formaldehyde of the order of a few hundred pptv. The better agreement was observed between the fluorescence and DOAS instruments. Two DOAS instruments were compared to the glass coil/Hantzsch reaction/fluorescence technique at a semi-polluted site on the North Norfolk coast, U.K., where concentrations of formaldehyde were observed at levels up to 4 ppbv. A very good agreement was observed between the two instruments. The glass coil/Hantzsch reaction/fluorescence and the TDLAS instruments were also deployed simultaneously in order to measure indoor air inside a mobile laboratory located at the Imperial College Silwood Park site near Ascot, U.K. The doors of the mobile laboratory were left open in order to obtain the background formaldehyde concentrations. Closing them afterwards allowed us to observe the increase in concentrations as a result of indoor emissions. The agreement between the two instruments was outstanding (correlation coefficient was 99%). The results from this study showed that of the four instruments included in this intercomparison the glass coil/Hantzsch reaction/fluorescence technique proved the most suitable for continuous measurements of formaldehyde in the background atmosphere.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

These are presented and the behaviour of recently formed ultra-fine particles is discussed. No ultrafine particles were observed in maritime air masses, however 3 to 7 nm particles were frequently observed at enhanced concentrations when the wind direction was from the land. Their formation was favoured at lower temperatures, when 1 ppbv or more of SO2 was present and in air masses that had not been aged extensively. On days when enhanced ultra-fine particle concentrations were observed, 3 nm particles increased sharply in the morning, approximately 30 to 90 minutes after the UV solar flux first increased. By early afternoon the ultra-fine particle concentration had returned to background levels. Rapid measurements of 5 nm particles showed no correlation with turbulence parameters, although the boundary layer mixing scales were similar to growth times of freshly nucleated particles to 5 nm diameter. However, ultra-fine particle concentrations do correlate with the availability of sulphuric acid vapour. A delay of approximately an hour between the increase of H2SO4 in the morning and a large increase in ultra-fine particle concentrations is due to the growth of particles to observable sizes, not the nucleation process itself. An analysis of the timescales for growth showed that coagulation may be important immediately the particles have nucleated but its effectiveness reduces as number concentration falls. Conversely, growth by condensation is initially slow due to the Kelvin effect but increases in importance as the particles reach observable sizes.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The campaign used two high-altitude aircraft - the Russian M55 Geophysica and the Australian Grob 520 Egrett, which can reach 20 and 15 km, respectively - complemented by upward-pointing lidar measurements from the DLR Falcon and low-level aerosol and chemical measurements from the U.K. Dornier-228. The meteorology during the campaign was characterized mainly by premonsoon conditions - isolated afternoon thunderstorms with more organized convective systems in the evening and overnight. At the beginning of November pronounced pollution resulting from widespread biomass burning was measured by the Dornier, giving way gradually to cleaner conditions by December, thus affording the opportunity to study the influence of aerosols on convection. The Egrett was used mainly to sample in and around the outflow from isolated thunderstorms, with a couple of survey missions near the end. The Geophysica-Falcon pair spent about 40% of their flight hours on survey legs, prioritizing remote sensing of water vapor, cirrus, and trace gases, and e remainder on close encounters with storm systems, prioritizing in situ measurements.

Against this back drop, the slow progress by the International Maritime Organization to tackle shipping emissions has led the EU to threaten sub-global policies by 2013. However, if national governments take heed of the scientific evidence underpinning the global 2°C temperature target enshrined within the Copenhagen Accord, all greenhouse gas emitting sectors need to decarbonise to a very high degree within the coming two decades. Although the global nature of the shipping sector likely requires global policy solutions, this does not exclude the potential for individual nations to reduce shipping emissions within their scope of influence. This paper investigates opportunities and barriers around accounting for shipping within national emissions inventories and national mitigation policy aimed at shipping. Nations have significant influence over emissions in national waters, the movement of freight into that nation and the type of fuel sold and could develop sub-global policies aimed at these aspects accordingly. Whilst several apportionment regimes offer scope for both measuring and monitoring the effectiveness of these sub-global policies, the regime used within UNFCCC arguably underestimates the ‘fair’ proportion of shipping activity attributable to the UK. Those methods that closely relate to the aspects that nations can influence tend towards the higher estimates. Therefore, even if the UK Government does not wish to implement national mitigation policy aimed at shipping, its current national budgets and targets need to be reassessed in light of the higher estimates for the CO2 emissions from UK shipping, particularly as they could be up to six times higher than currently recorded. If one of the higher figures is considered appropriated, the UK’s 2050 target and the stringency of cuts from other sectors will need to be adjusted to remain consistent with the CCC’s carbon budgets and the UK’s 2°C commitments under the Copenhagen Accord.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

C.; Collett, J. L.; Moore, K. F.; Sherman, D. E.","Apr 2000","The ACE-2 HILLCLOUD experiment was carried out on the island of Tenerife in June-July 1997 to investigate the interaction of the boundary layer aerosol with a hill cap cloud forming over a ridge to the north-east of the island. The cloud was used as a natural flow through reactor to investigate the dependence of the cloud microphysics and chemistry on the characteristics of the aerosols and trace gases entering cloud, and to simultaneously study the influence of the physical and chemical processes occurring within the cloud on the size distribution, chemical and hygroscopic properties of the aerosol exiting cloud. 5 major ground base sites were used, measuring trace gases and aerosols upwind and downwind of the cloud, and cloud microphysics and chemistry and interstitial aerosol and gases within the cloud on the hill. 8 intensive measurement periods or runs were undertaken during cloud events, (nocturnally for seven of the eight runs) and were carried out in a wide range of airmass conditions from clean maritime to polluted continental. Polluted air was characterised by higher than average concentrations of ozone (> 50 ppbv), fine and accumulation mode aerosols (> 3000 and > 1500 cm-3, respectively) and higher aerosol mass loadings. Cloud droplet number concentrations N, increased from 50 cm-3 in background maritime air to > 2500 cm-3 in aged polluted continental air, a concentration much higher than had previously been detected. Surprisingly, N was seen to vary almost linearly with aerosol number across this range. The droplet aerosol analyser (DAA) measured higher droplet numbers than the corrected forward scattering spectrometer probe (FSSP) in the most polluted air, but at other times there was good agreement (FSSP = 0.95 DAA with an r2 = 0.89 for N <1200 cm-3). Background ammonia gas concentrations were around 0.3 ppbv even in air originating over the ocean, another unexpected but important result for the region. NO2 was present in background concentrations of typically 15 pptv to 100 pptv and NO3. (the nitrate radical) was observed at night throughout. Calculations suggest NO3. losses were mainly by reaction with DMS to produce nitric acid. Low concentrations of SO2 (~30 pptv), HNO3 and HCl were always present. HNO3 concentrations were higher in polluted episodes and calculations implied that these exceeded those which could be accounted for by NO2 oxidation. It is presumed that nitric and hydrochloric acids were present as a result of outgassing from aerosol, the HNO3 from nitrate rich aerosol transported into the region from upwind of Tenerife, and HCl from sea salt aerosol newly formed at the sea surface. The oxidants hydrogen peroxide and ozone were abundant (i.e., were well in excess over SO2 throughout the experiment). Occasions of significant aerosol growth following cloud processing were observed, particularly in cleaner cases. Observations and modelling suggested this was due mainly to the take up of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and ammonia by the smallest activated aerosol particles. On a few occasions a small contribution was made by the in-cloud oxidation of S(IV). The implications of these results from HILLCLOUD for the climatologically more important stratocumulus Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) clouds are considered.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.","Mar 2020","This paper studies a novel sustainable ship routing problem considering a time window concept and bunker fuel management. Ship routing involves the decisions corresponding to the deployment of vessels to multiple ports and time window concept helps to maintain the service level of the port. Reducing carbon emissions within the maritime transportation domain remains one of the most significant challenges as it addresses the sustainability aspect. Bunker fuel management deals with the fuel bunkering issues faced by different ships, such as selection of bunkering ports and total bunkered amount at a port. A novel mathematical model is developed capturing the intricacies of the problem. A hybrid particle swarm optimization with a basic variable neighborhood search algorithm is proposed to solve the model and compared with the exact solutions obtained using Cplex and other popular algorithms for several problem instances. The proposed algorithm outperforms other popular algorithms in all the instances in terms of the solution quality and provides good quality solutions with an average cost deviation of 5.99% from the optimal solution.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

J.; Choularton, T. W.; Gallagher, M. W.; Bower, K. N.; Flynn, M. J.; Whiteway, J. A.","Oct 2006","The Hector thunderstorm is studied with a numerical cloud-resolving model. Special attention is given to modelling the mixed-phase and glaciated cloud microphysical processes (along with the implications of aerosols) and their influence on the resulting microphysical and dynamical storm structure. Radiative impacts are also calculated. Simulations are performed for a typical storm case from the EMERALD-II convective cloud experiment in November and December 2002. It is found that, for intense thunderstorms, aerosol indirect effects are generally modified from recently proposed theoretical considerations. Specifically, the proposed 'glaciation' indirect effect, resulting from increasing ice nuclei concentrations, is small for intense convection. More importantly, increasing ice number concentrations results in a 'collection' indirect effect (where aggregation and accretion processes lead to precipitation) rather than the 'glaciation', Bergeron-Findeisen process. There is a 'thermodynamic' indirect effect for Hector, as increasing the cloud droplet number concentration from maritime to continental values resulted in a suppression of the heterogeneous freezing process. However, for extreme continental cases, liquid and raindrop freezing by collection processes acquires higher importance; hence there is an optimal value for strong cumulonimbus development. The 'glaciation' indirect effect is found to be similar to increasing the rate of ice production by the Hallett-Mossop process. Another aspect of this study shows that there is a significant impact of microphysics on cloud dynamics, and so studying aerosol-cloud effects must also consider dynamical feedback, a strong component of which arises from the latent heat released during homogeneous freezing. The important indirect effects may be well described by recent theory for smaller, more common stratiform and cumulus clouds; however, in the tropics, the importance of Hector-type storms cannot be ignored as they, and other similar storms, provide a mechanism for the production of widespread cirrus and the release of a large amount of precipitation. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2006.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

I.; McFiggans, G.; Gallagher, M. W.; Beswick, K. M.; Bower, K. N.; Choularton, T. W.","27 Nov 2000","Particle size distribution measurements were made at a coastal site in the United Kingdom. These are presented, and the behavior of recently formed ultrafine particles is discussed. No ultrafine particles were observed in maritime air masses; however, 3 to 7 nm particles were frequently observed at enhanced concentrations when the wind direction was from the land. Their formation was favored at lower temperatures, when 1 ppbv or more of SO2 was present and in air masses that had not been aged extensively. On days when enhanced ultrafine particle concentrations were observed, 3 nm particles increased sharply in the morning, approximately 30 to 90 min after the UV solar flux first increased. By early afternoon the ultrafine particle concentration had returned to background levels. Rapid measurements of 5 nm particles showed no correlation with turbulence parameters, although the boundary layer mixing scales were similar to growth times of freshly nucleated particles to 5 nm diameter. However, ultrafine particle concentrations do correlate with the availability of sulphuric acid vapor. A delay of approximately an hour between the increase of H2SO4 in the morning and a large increase in ultrafine particle concentrations is due to the growth of particles to observable sizes, not the nucleation process itself. An analysis of the timescales for growth showed that coagulation may be important immediately after the particles have nucleated but its effectiveness reduces as number concentration falls. Conversely, growth by condensation is initially slow due to the Kelvin effect but increases in importance as the particles reach observable sizes.

Here, we established BCAS3 loss-of-function variants as causative for a neurodevelopmental disorder. We report 15 individuals from eight unrelated families with germline bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in BCAS3. All probands share a global developmental delay accompanied by pyramidal tract involvement, microcephaly, short stature, strabismus, dysmorphic facial features, and seizures. The human phenotype is less severe compared with the Bcas3 knockout mouse model and cannot be explained by angiogenic defects alone. Consistent with being loss-of-function alleles, we observed absence of BCAS3 in probands' primary fibroblasts. By comparing the transcriptomic and proteomic data based on probands' fibroblasts with those of the knockout mouse model, we identified similar dysregulated pathways resulting from over-representation analysis, while the dysregulation of some proposed key interactors could not be confirmed. Together with the results from a tissue-specific Drosophila loss-of-function model, we demonstrate a vital role for BCAS3 in neural tissue development.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Properties of small cirrus ice crystals from commercial aircraft measurements and implications for flight operations","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/properties-of-small-cirrus-ice-crystals-from-commercial-aircraft-","Beswick, K.; Baumgardner, D.; Gallagher, M.; Raga, G.; Minnis, P.; Spangenberg, D.; Volz-Thomas, A.; Nedelec, P.; Wang, K.","13 Oct 2015","Measurements of cloud ice crystal size distributions have been made by a backscatter cloud probe (BCP) mounted on five commercial airliners flying international routes that cross five continents. Bulk cloud parameters were also derived from the size distributions. As of 31 December 2014, a total of 4399 flights had accumulated data from 665 hours in more than 19 000 cirrus clouds larger than 5 km in length. The BCP measures the equivalent optical diameter (EOD) of individual crystals in the 5–90 µm range from which size distributions are derived and recorded every 4 seconds. The cirrus cloud property database, an ongoing development stemming from these measurements, registers the total crystal number and mass concentration, effective and median volume diameters and extinction coefficients derived from the size distribution. This information is accompanied by the environmental temperature, pressure, aircraft position, date and time of each sample. The seasonal variations of the cirrus cloud properties measured from 2012 to 2014 are determined for six geographic regions in the tropics and extratropics. Number concentrations range from a few per litre for thin cirrus to several hundreds of thousands for heavy cirrus. Temperatures range from 205 to 250 K and effective radii from 12 to 20 µm. A comparison of the regional and seasonal number and mass size distributions, and the bulk microphysical properties derived from them, demonstrates that cirrus properties cannot be easily parameterised by temperature or by latitude. The seasonal changes in the size distributions from the extratropical Atlantic and Eurasian air routes are distinctly different, showing shifts from mono-modal to bi-modal spectra out of phase with one another. This phase difference may be linked to the timing of deep convection and cold fronts that lead to the cirrus formation. Likewise, the size spectra of cirrus over the tropical Atlantic and Eastern Brazil differ from each other although they were measured in adjoining regions. The cirrus crystals in the maritime continental tropical region over Malaysia form tri-modal spectra that are not found in any of the other regions measured by the IAGOS aircraft so far, a feature that is possibly linked to biomass burning or dust. Frequent measurements of ice crystal concentrations greater than 1×105 L−1, often accompanied by anomalously warm temperature and erratic airspeed readings, suggest that aircraft often experience conditions that affect their sensors. This new instrument, if used operationally, has the potential of providing real-time and valuable information to assist in flight operations as well as providing real-time information for along-track nowcasting.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Development of regional characterization factors for aquatic eutrophication","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/development-of-regional-characterization-factors-for-aquatic-eutr","Gallego Schmid, A.; Rodríguez, L.; Hospido, A.; Moreira, M. T.; Feijoo, G.","Jan 2010","Background, aim, and scope: Life cycle assessment (LCA) has traditionally been considered a site-independent tool, but nowadays, there is a trend towards making LCA more site-dependent. Site-dependent characterization factors have been calculated for regional impact categories such as acidification, terrestrial and aquatic eutrophication, and smog. Specifically, for aquatic eutrophication, characterization factors have been proposed for large geographical areas (mainly European and North American countries). Those factors are not detailed enough for countries which present large geographical, climatic, and economical variability such as Spain. Therefore, this work aims to calculate the characterization factors and the normalization reference for aquatic eutrophication at a regional level, using Galicia (NW Spain), a region with increasing problems of eutrophication, as a case study. Finally, the comparison of the factors obtained here with literature values will be used to analyze the influence of spatial differentiation with increasing coverage of the causality chain. Materials and methods: Particular ecological and economic reasons justify the estimation of characterization factors in Galicia taking into account the specific characteristics of three different ecosystems: Atlantic Ocean, freshwaters, and rias (a specific ecosystem that takes place when a river valley is submerged by a rise in sea level). Taking into account that the state of the art does not allow the calculation of an exhaustive effect factor, the work was focused on the calculation of transport and equivalency factors. Results: Both the principal pathways of transport and the sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were considered to calculate the characterization factors, and from them, the normalization reference was also obtained. An analysis on uncertainty identified the estimations of fractions of NHx-N and NOx-N deposited on maritime waters, land, and freshwaters and the fraction of N and P deposited in the soil that reaches water ecosystems, as the more uncertain values. Discussion: As the rias are both N- and P-limited ecosystems, which is a characteristic of coastal and brackish waters in general, the approximation followed in this study to establish characterization factors for the rias can be applied to these types of ecosystems elsewhere (e.g., fiords in Norway) in order to better define aquatic eutrophication impact. By comparing the results obtained with those available in the literature, it is clear that the application of transport factors in the calculation of characterization factors leads to a more realistic definition of aquatic eutrophication, especially when P inputs to the soil are present. When varying the spatial differentiation (continent, country, or region), characterization factors do not vary significantly; however, this variation is likely to increase as long as the definition of the causality chain is improved as it has been reported for other impact categories. In this sense, the equations used in this study can be adapted when those effect factors became available, being flexible and suitable for future applications in other regions. Conclusions: This study describes the process to calculate aquatic eutrophication characterization factors at a more detailed scale than country, with the particularity of differentiating three different aquatic ecosystems, considering for the first time the rias. The results show the importance of including transport factors in the calculation of characterization factors for aquatic eutrophication, while spatial differentiation is less important at this level of sophistication in terms of coverage of the causality chain. Recommendations and perspectives: The estimation of effect and damage factors is regarded as the next step in the sophistication of this category. On the other hand, the significance of transport factors makes their estimation for other regions than Europe and North America (the only available at the moment) also desirable.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The tested models range from the regional to the global scale, and include numerical weather prediction (NWP), chemical transport, and chemistry-climate models. Idealised tracers were used in order to prevent the model's chemistry schemes from influencing the results substantially, so that the effects of modelled transport could be isolated. We find large differences in the vertical transport of very short-lived tracers (with a lifetime of 6 h) within the tropical troposphere. Peak convective outflow altitudes range from around 300 hPa to almost 100 hPa among the different models, and the upper tropospheric tracer mixing ratios differ by up to an order of magnitude. The timing of convective events is found to be different between the models, even among those which source their forcing data from the same NWP model (ECMWF). The differences are less pronounced for longer lived tracers, however they could have implications for modelling the halogen burden of the lowermost stratosphere through transport of species such as bromoform, or short-lived hydrocarbons into the lowermost stratosphere. The modelled tracer profiles are strongly influenced by the convective transport parameterisations, and different boundary layer mixing parameterisations also have a large impact on the modelled tracer profiles. Preferential locations for rapid transport from the surface into the upper troposphere are similar in all models, and are mostly concentrated over the western Pacific, the Maritime Continent and the Indian Ocean. In contrast, models do not indicate that upward transport is highest over western Africa.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

In sub-Saharan Africa, several domestic and commensal animals were introduced from Asia in the pre-modern period; however, the timing and nature of these introductions remain contentious. One model supports introduction to the eastern African coast after the mid-first millennium CE, while another posits introduction dating back to 3000 BCE. These distinct scenarios have implications for understanding the emergence of long-distance maritime connectivity, and the ecological and economic impacts of introduced species. Resolution of this longstanding debate requires new efforts, given the lack of well-dated fauna from high-precision excavations, and ambiguous osteomorphological identifications. We analysed fau-nal remains from 22 eastern African sites spanning a wide geographic and chronological range, and applied biomolecular techniques to confirm identifications of two Asian taxa: domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) and black rat (Rattus rattus). Our approach included ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis aided by BLAST-based bioinformatics, Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) collagen fingerprinting, and direct AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) radiocarbon dating. Our results support a late, mid-first millennium CE introduction of these species. We discuss the implications of our findings for models of biological exchange, and emphasize the applicability of our approach to tropical areas with poor bone preservation.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The Aerosol and Chemical Transport in tropical conVEction (ACTIVE) aircraft campaign was conducted from November 2005 to February 2006 from Darwin, Australia, to characterize the influence of both monsoonal and localized land-based deep convection on the composition of the TTL. This paper summarizes the composition of the potential inflow to such convection in terms of aerosol particle size and composition, carbon monoxide, and ozone, as measured in the lowest 4 km of the atmosphere by the NERC Domier-228 aircraft during 28 flights in different meteorological regimes over the course of ACTIVE. Six contrasting periods are identified in the boundary layer background as a result of the prevailing meteorology and sources of pollution. The campaign began with a relatively polluted and variable biomass burning season in November, followed by a transition to the monsoon season through December with much less burning. A clean maritime flow dominated the wet-active, and dry-inactive, monsoon period in January; it was followed by a monsoon break period in February, with a return to continental flow and a more premonsoon background state. Deep convective systems, capable of transporting boundary layer air to the TTL, were observed daily outside of the monsoon periods. The chemical composition of submicron aerosols in the premonsoon periods was dominated by a mix of fresh and aged organic material with significant black carbon, well-coffelated with carbon monoxide indicating a common burning source, while marine aerosol during the monsoon changed markedly between the wet and dry phases. High concentrations of coarse-mode aerosols were also observed in the monsoon: the clean, marine air masses and high surface winds imply that sea salt may be the dominant aerosol type under these conditions. The climatology presented here will provide a valuable data set for model simulation of chemical and aerosol transport by deep convection in the Darwin region.

Measurements of carbon monoxide, ozone, aerosol size/composition, and non-methane hydrocarbons were made from aircraft, flying north from Darwin, Australia as part of the Aerosol and Chemical Transport In tropical conVEction (ACTIVE) campaign. A chemical equator, defined as a sharp gradient in the chemical background, was found not to be coincident with the Intertropical Convergence Zone during this period. A pronounced interfacial region was identified between 8.5 and 10°S, where tracer mixing ratios increased rapidly within the boundary layer, e.g. CO from 40 ppbv to 160 ppbv within 0.5° latitude (50 km), with inhibited inter-hemispheric mixing. These measurements are discussed in context using a combination of meteorological and Earth-observing satellite imagery, back trajectory analysis and chemical model data with the conclusion that air flowing into and subsequently uplifted by the active convection of the Tropical Warm Pool (TWP) region in the Western Pacific is likely to be highly polluted, and will perturb the composition of the Tropical Tropopause Layer. The main source of CO and other pollutants within the TWP region is expected to be biomass burning, with extensive fires in North Sumatra and Thailand during this period. The sharp gradient in composition at the chemical equator seen here results from extensive burning to the north, contrasting with pristine maritime air advected from the Southern Indian Ocean by a strong land-based cyclone over the Northern Territory of Australia.

Ascorbic acid (100 mg L-1) was applied through the rooting medium, or as seed soaking or as foliar spray to non-stressed and salt stressed plants of wheat. Salt stress-induced reduction in growth was ameliorated by exogenous application of ascorbic acid through different ways. However, root applied AsA caused more growth enhancement under saline conditions. Leaf ascorbic acid, catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were also maximal in salt stressed plants of both cultivars treated with AsA through the rooting medium. Furthermore, leaf ascorbic acid, CAT, POD, and SOD activities were higher in salt stressed plants of 'S-24' than those of 'MH-97'. Root applied AsA caused more enhancements in photosynthetic rate. Root applied AsA caused more reduction in leaf sodium (Na+) compared with AsA applied as a seed soaking or foliar spray.

M.; Van Hellemond, J.","1 Jan 1997","INTRODUCTIONThere is ample evidence in literature that aerosol is not only deposited but seems to be emitted under certain conditions (e.g. Gallagher et al., 1997). Processes that could potentially lead to production of new particles or the growth of existing particles include the interaction of ammonium aerosol with ammonia and acidic gases. As a result of the differences in surface / atmosphere exchange rates and mechanisms of ammonia, acidic gases and aerosols the surface flux of ammonia can disturb the equilibria of NH 4 NO 3 and NH 4 Cl leading to aerosol evaporation or condensation.Investigations into the growth and production of aerosols in situ in the atmosphere (gas-to-particle conversion, gtpc) are important in many respects. The partitioning of total NH x between the aerosol and the gas phase influences the rate of the surface / atmosphere exchange of NH x (e.g., if gtpc provides an efficient sink of gaseous NH 3 , this could enhance emission) and the range of transport (as a secondary and slowly deposition species NH 4 + aerosol is transported over longer distances than NH 3 ). Aerosols play an important role in global and climatic processes, both directly through radiative forcing and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei, and it is therefore of importance to investigate and quantify the processes of their formation and destruction. Except for coagulation, the growth mechanisms of aerosols and the production and here gtpc of ammonia could provide one of the key mechanisms.Theoretical studies have been performed to model the concentration profiles of NH 3 , HNO 3 , HCl, NH 4 NO 3 and NH 4 Cl as modified by their interaction. Quantitative predictions, however, are extremely difficult because the equilibrium products and chemical time-scales involved are largely unknown and highly dependent on the composition and size distribution of the aerosol. Moreover, there are very few data sets of simultaneous surface / atmosphere fluxes of aerosols and gaseous species involved.MEASUREMENTSA joint field campaign was performed in May / June 1996 near Elspeet, NL, over heathland and focused on the simultaneous measurements of all parameters necessary to assess the mechanisms and quantify effects of ammonia / aerosol interactions. During the 4 week campaign the usual micrometeorological parameters were measured (friction velocity, sensible and latent and soil heat fluxes, net radiation, PAR, temperature, relative humidity, wind direction). Wet denuders (ECN, NL) were used at 2 - 3 heights to separate gases and aerosol species. The gases were collected in a suitable stripping solution on the denuder walls, whereas the aerosols passing through the denuders were collected using a steam jet aerosol collector (SJAC). Both collection solutions (containing gases and aerosols) were analyzed online for NH 4 + using a membrane-diffusion-conductivity system and for SO 4 2 - , Cl - and MN 3 - using online anion chromatography (IC). This way continuous measurements of the gradients of particulate ammonium, nitrate, chloride and sulphate were obtained together with fluxes of NH 3 , HCl, HNO 3 and SO 2 . Backup was provided by gradient measurements using batch techniques such as automated rotating wet denuders and filter packs.Particle number concentrations were obtained with an aerodynamic particle sizer (D p = 0.5 - 15 μm) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS, 0.1 - 0.8 μm) the latter of which was used for short periods to measure gradients. Aerosol number fluxes (0.1 - 3 μm) were measured by eddy correlation technique using a fast response optical particle counter (PMS, ASASP-x), but channels above 0.5 μm had to be discarded due to limited counting statistics. Some 12-hr runs with a 7 stage cascade impactor (Berner) provided the chemical composition of the different particle sizes.FIRST RESULTSThe results provide a unique dataset for intercomparison studies of different (partially novel) techniques of measuring the deposition rate of aerosol as well as to study the origin of and composition of particles at this fairly polluted Dutch site. In particular, it gives the opportunity to study the interactions of aerosols with NH 3 and acidic gases: daily variations in the aerosol sizes, formation of ultra-fine aerosol, the attainment of phase equilibria and the influence of gtpc on NH 3 flux measurements.In contrast to previous measurements which had shown considerable NH 3 emission at this heathland site NH 3 was found to be mainly deposited with very short spells of morning emission. Nitric acid and hydrochloric acid were continuously deposited. And the concentrations of both acidic gases and aerosols were fairly variable, indicating the presence of near by sources. NH 4 + and SO 4 2 - aerosols were both found in a very similar size range (average mass median diameter, MMD = 0.25 μm), whereas NO 3 - aerosol was considerably larger (0.60 μm). Ions of probably maritime origin (Na + , Ca 2 + ) showed a MMD of 1.2 - 1.5 μm and chloride one of 0.83 μm. The eddy correlation flux measurements show a strong diurnal variation of the deposition velocity (V d ) with typical values of 2 - 5 mm s - 1 during day- and below 0.2 mm s - 1 at stable and calm night-time conditions. Over the size range in which the number concentration was high enough for data analysis (0.1 - 0.5 μm) the deposition velocity increases monotonously, which is in agreement with other measurements (Gallagher et al., 1997) but in contrast to model results (Slinn, 1982).The analysis of the data with respect to gas-particle interactions is currently ongoing and the results will be presented at the conference.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Exogenously applied ascorbic acid alleviates salt-induced oxidative stress in wheat","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/exogenously-applied-ascorbic-acid-alleviates-salt-induced-oxidati","Athar, H. U. R.; Khan, A.; Ashraf, M.","May 2008","Although ascorbic acid (AsA) is one of the most important and abundantly occurring water soluble antioxidants in plants, relatively little is known about its role in counteracting the adverse effects of salt stress on plant growth. To address this issue that whether exogenous application of ascorbic acid (AsA) through rooting medium could alleviate the adverse effects of salt stress on wheat plants, a hydroponic experiment was conducted under glasshouse conditions using two wheat cultivars, S-24 (salt tolerant) and MH-97 (moderately salt sensitive). Plants of both cultivars were subjected to 0 or 150 mM NaCl solution supplemented with 0, 50, or 150 mg L-1 AsA for 58 days. Imposition of salt stress reduced the growth of both wheat cultivars by causing reduction in photosynthesis, and endogenous AsA level, and enhancing accumulation of Na+ and Cl- coupled with a decrease in K+ and Ca2+ in the leaves and roots of both cultivars thereby decreasing tissue K+/Na+ ratio. However, root applied AsA counteracted the adverse effects of salt stress on the growth of cv. S-24 only, particularly at 100 mg L-1 AsA level. AsA-induced enhancement in growth of salt-stressed plants of S-24 was associated with enhanced endogenous AsA level and CAT activity, and higher photosynthetic capacity, and accumulation of K+ and Ca2+ in the leaves. Although root applied AsA did not improve the growth of salt-stressed plants of MH-97, it enhanced endogenous level of AsA, CAT activity, photosynthetic capacity, and leaf K+ and Ca2+. These findings led us to conclude that root applied AsA counteracts the adverse effects of salt stress on growth of wheat by improving photosynthetic capacity of wheat plants against salt-induced oxidative stress and maintaining ion homeostasis, however, these effects were cultivar specific. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

H.; Athar, H. R.; Ashraf, M.; Hameed, A.","Jul 2007","Modulation of water relations, activities of antioxidant enzymes and ion accumulation was assessed in the plants of two wheat cultivars S-24 (salt tolerant) and MH-97 (moderately salt sensitive) subjected to saline conditions and glycinebetaine (GB) applied foliarly. Different levels of GB, i.e., 0 (unsprayed), 50 and 100 mM (in 0.10% Tween-20 solution) were applied to the wheat plants at the vegetative growth stage. Leaf water potential, leaf osmotic potential and turgor potential were decreased due to salt stress. Salt stress increased the Na+ and Cl- accumulation coupled with a decrease in K+ and Ca2+ in the leaves and roots of both cultivars thereby decreasing tissue K+/Na+ and Ca2+/Na+ ratios. Furthermore, salt stress decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), whereas it increased the activities of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) in both wheat cultivars. However, accumulation of GB in the leaves of both wheat cultivars was consistently increased with an increase in concentration of exogenous GB application under both non-saline and saline conditions. Accumulation of Na+ was decreased with an increase in K+ accumulation upon a consistent increase in GB accumulation under salt stress conditions thereby resulting in better K+/Na+ and Ca2+/Na+ ratios in the leaves and roots. High accumulation of GB and K+ mainly contributed to osmotic adjustment, which is one of the factors known to be responsible for improving growth and yield under salt stress. The activities of all antioxidant enzymes, SOD, CAT and POD were enhanced by GB application in cv. MH-97 under saline conditions, whereas all these except SOD were reduced in cv. S-24. It is likely that both applied GB and intrinsic SOD scavenged ROS in the tolerant cultivar thereby resulting into low activities of CAT and POD enzymes under salt stress. In conclusion, the adverse effects of salt stress on wheat can be alleviated by the exogenous application of 100 mM GB by modulating activities of antioxidant enzymes and changes in water relations and ion homeostasis. Furthermore, effectiveness of GB application on regulation of activities of antioxidant enzymes was found to be cultivar-specific. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

U. R.","May 2008","A greenhouse experiment was conducted to assess whether exogenously applied 24-epibrassionlide (24-epiBL) could alleviate the adverse effects of salt on wheat. Two hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars, S-24 (salt tolerant) and MH-97 (moderately salt sensitive), were grown under control (0 mM NaCl in full strength Hoagland's nutrient solution) or saline conditions (150 mM of NaCl in full strength Hoagland's nutrient solution). After 41 days growth of wheat plants under saline conditions, 24-epiBL was applied as a foliar spray. Four levels of BR were used as 0 (water spray), 0.0125, 0.025, and 0.0375 mg l-1. Application of 24-epiBL increased plant biomass and leaf area per plant of both cultivars under non-saline conditions. However, under saline conditions, improvement in growth due to exogenous 24-epiBL was observed only in S-24. Photosynthetic rate was reduced due to salt stress in both cultivars, but this inhibitory effect was ameliorated significantly by the exogenous application of 24-epiBL. Exogenously applied 24-epiBL also enhanced the photosystem-II efficiency in both cultivars measured as F v /F m ratio. Although the activities of antioxidant enzymes, Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Peroxidase (POD) and Catalase (CAT) were increased due to salt stress in both wheat cultivars, exogenously applied 24-epiBL had a varying effect on the antioxidant system. The activity of SOD remained unaffected in both cultivars due to 24-epiBL application, but that of POD and CAT was promoted in the salt stressed plants of cv. S-24 only. In conclusion, improvement in growth in both wheat cultivars due to foliar applied 24-epiBL was found to be associated with 24-epiBL-induced enhancement in photosynthetic capacity.

In this paper we review the burgeoning, yet still embryonic literature on the BRI. Our aim is to move beyond currently dominant framings of the BRI as a geopolitical or economic strategy that tend to overlook the complex embeddedness of infrastructure. Drawing on theories of planetary urbanization, we argue that the BRI constitutes a form of urbanization that is bound up with the socio‐spatial and ecological restructuring of global capitalism. We illustrate this by mapping and analysing energy projects under the BRI. Overall, we outline a research agenda on the BRI that calls for: 1) a more nuanced analysis of its spatial and scalar politics; 2) approaching the BRI as a distinctly urban question; and 3) a disruption of the dominant China‐centric discussions through critical in‐depth case‐study analysis.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.; Robinson, C. H.","17 Jan 2019","Our understanding of the diversity and community dynamics of soil fungi has increased greatly through the use of DNA‐based identification. Community characterisation of metabolically active communities via RNA sequencing has previously revealed differences between ‘active’ and ‘total’ fungal communities, which may be influenced by the persistence of DNA from non‐active components. However, it is not known how fungal traits influence their prevalence in these contrasting community profiles. In this study, we co‐extracted DNA and RNA from soil collected from three Antarctic islands to test for differences between total and active soil fungal communities. By matching these geographically isolated fungi against a global dataset of soil fungi, we show that widely dispersed taxa are often more abundant in the total community, whilst taxa restricted to Antarctica are more likely to have higher abundance in the active community. In addition, we find that active communities have lower richness, and show a reduction in the abundance of the most dominant fungi, whilst there are consistent differences in the abundances of certain taxonomic groups between the total and active communities. These results suggest that the views of soil fungal communities offered by DNA‐ and RNA‐based characterisation differ in predictable ways.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

In this first essay, we explore the drastic change Britain underwent in the mid-18th century, as agriculture and traditional production methods began to mechanise, increasing productivity to exceed the limits of the land and human strength. For the first time, people witnessed increases in the standard of living within a generation as national wealth soared. It ended centuries of subsistence living in which growth was negligible. As the 19th century dawned, Britain welcomed the steam era, an ignition of modernity, transforming travel, trade and production. We shed light on the wider repercussions of Britain’s economic dominance, highlighting the consequences of rapid urbanisation and assessing the implications of the era of Imperial strength.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The first factor is determined by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), whose nodes represent the blip's characteristics, including the velocity, direction and size. Additionally, the structure and conditional probability tables of the DAG can be learned from verified samples. Subsequently, obstacles in a waterway can be described as collision potential fields using an Artificial Potential Field model, and the corresponding coefficients can be trained in accordance with the historical vessel distribution. Then, the other factor, the positional collision potential of any position is obtained through overlapping all the collision potential fields. For simplicity, only static obstacles have been considered. Eventually, the two factors are characterised as evidence, and the collision probability of a blip is estimated by combining them with Dempster's rule. Through ranking blips on collision probabilities, those that pose high threat to safety can be picked up in advance to remind radar operators. Particularly, a good agreement between the proposed approach and the manual operation was found in a preliminary test.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Then, it is transformed to be multiple pieces of evidence, which are formulated as generalised belief distributions representing the probabilistic relationships between the blip's states of authenticity and the values of its attributes. Subsequently, the ER rule is used to combine these pieces of evidence, taking into account their corresponding reliabilities and weights. Furthermore, based on different objectives and verified samples, weight coefficients can be trained with a non-linear optimisation model. Finally, two field tests of identifying moving vessels from radar images have been conducted to validate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed approach.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Despite this, recent changes to Japan's overall grand strategy and military posture remain incremental and focused on longer-term transformation. We argue that despite a degree of convergence in threat perceptions between the Japanese public and elites—and despite a greater tolerance of debate on controversial security issues—the increased political influence of revisionist conservatives arouses suspicion owing to the interlinkages between their political, social and security agendas. This, in turn, the article argues, complicates moves towards a more robust, responsive and flexible Japanese deterrence posture and an approach to alliance deepening suitable for minimizing contemporary geopolitical vulnerability and risk.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

During Heinrich Stadials, the ocean was chilled by icebergs calved from the great ice sheets. The impact of multiple temperature and precipitation regime changes on Late Pleistocene mountain glaciers and landscape development is poorly understood. Here we analyse 1,118 cosmogenic exposure ages—spanning the last 100,000 years—from glacial landforms on three continents across the Mediterranean. We evaluate their geomorphological context and stratify the record by depositional setting and geographical region. The database includes 300 dated moraines. We show that, despite cold temperatures, Heinrich Stadial aridity caused negative glacier mass balance and repeatedly stalled glacier growth across the Mediterranean. In contrast, relatively warm and humid climates between Heinrich Stadials favoured positive glacier mass balance, resulting in region-wide glacier growth and moraine formation. Our analysis supports climate model simulations of repeated and widespread Heinrich Stadial aridity in the Mediterranean basin during the last cold stage. Heinrich Stadials also saw enhanced supply of coarse debris from valley sides. The cumulative geomorphological impact of these climate shifts saw the largest moraines form at the culmination of the glacial cycle.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

M.; Hess, M.","2013","Contemporary economic globalization as a highly dynamic process has seen substantial changesin its organization, governance, geographies and impacts. These global shifts can be characterizedby – among other aspects – increased functional and geographical fragmentation of productionprocesses, various waves of outsourcing and off-shoring, changing geographies of production andconsumption and associated labour market dynamics. At the same time, nation states and regionaleconomic blocs aim at increasing macro-regional and global integration through bilateral andmultilateral trade and investment negotiations, predicated on transformations in transportation andlogistics technologies that enable the functioning of complex global production networks (GPNs)and link regional, national and supra-national economies. This paper aims to assess theconsequences of what has been termed a ‘logistics revolution’ for economic and social upgradingin global logistics and client sectors. It starts by charting the existing research base and exploringthe structure and dynamics of the global logistics industry, before addressing the potential of andobstacles to economic and social upgrading. The analysis highlights the often-neglectedimportance of logistics as a global industry: a major employer and value generator in its own right,with its own evolving GPNs. It demonstrates the increasingly diverse structure of logisticsoperations and labour markets, creating opportunities for upgrading through innovation and newtechnologies, but at the same time it shows the continued prevalence of ‘low-road’ logistics labourmarkets and workers often struggling to secure labour rights, decent wages and improved workingconditions. These issues are illustrated and discussed for both the global logistics industry itselfand the logistics activities in client sectors such as horticulture, apparel and mobilecommunications. The paper concludes with reflections on the contingent and variegated outcomesof logistics development and avenues for future research.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This resonates well with work on postpolitics, which argues that carefully stage-managed consultation exercises can be part of a repertoire of depoliticising techniques that allow the authorities to present their preferred plans and policies as the only ‘reasonable’ options around which a wide-ranging consensus can be built. The effect is to deny voice to those who dissent and refuse to compromise around an economic and political model that they see as broken. This article explores how governments have responded to criticism of participation by devising more sophisticated ways for ‘enhancing’ participation whilst ensuring it does not disrupt the existing distribution of power.

Particularly, an unequal-distance discretisation method is proposed to reduce the intervals of a blip's characteristics for avoiding the combinatorial explosion problem. Then, the undetermined DAG structure and parameters are learned from manually verified data samples. Finally, based on the probabilities reasoned by the DAG, judgments on blips being moving vessels are determined by an appropriate threshold on a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The unique strength of the proposed methodology includes laying the foundation of targets extraction on original radar images and verified records without making any unrealistic assumptions on objects' states.

W.","20 Dec 2021","Resource recovery industries play a significant role in global sustainable development. Although existing reviews have been undertaken on how such sectors address sustainability, these tend not to consider the interconnections among sustainability dimensions in the macro (national/regional, international), meso (industry) and micro (firm/operation) levels of analysis. Taking ship-recycling as a focal resource recovery industry, this systematic literature review of 286 studies provides a holistic synthesis of six sustainability dimensions, producing a taxonomy of three sustainability challenge (environmental, social and economic) and three enabler (law and policy, technology and management) themes. Studies have to date focused on identifying the challenges, typically in a mono-dimensional manner, with less attention paid to developing enabling solutions. Across the challenge dimensions, sustainability is better regarded at the macro and meso levels of analysis, while remaining challenged and less understood at the micro level operations. Thus, the industry in its current state has been argued to face a ‘multi-level sustainability paradox’. Of the enabler themes, the law and policy investigations in ship-recycling predominantly addressed the macro-level issues in analysing the deficiency of current regulatory mechanisms and offering future ones. Conversely, the comparatively scarce studies on developing technological and management enablers have addressed the micro-level issues more to create environmentally and socially sustainable ship-recycling practices. This review concludes with suggestions for future research that considers a systems view to demonstrate how the sustainability challenges and enablers in ship-recycling are interconnected across various dimensions and levels of analysis – and form self-reinforcing vicious cycles which are more readily addressable through management enablers.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

While its signature ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ (BRI) is often portrayed as a threat by policy makers and media in the West, this article approaches the BRI from the perspective of Beijing. We review Chinese infrastructure investment and show that rather than a monolithic strategy aimed at world domination, the BRI is driven by a range of Chinese stakeholders situated at different scales whose motives vary from achieving strategic geopolitical advantage to profit-maximization. We focus on port investments to demonstrate that the BRI accelerated an ongoing trend of increasing Chinese investment in overseas ports that began in the early 2000s. We subsequently present mini-case studies of port projects Gwadar, Pakistan and Kuantan, Malaysia, which illustrate that large Central Government state-owned enterprises (SOEs) pursue strategic objectives while SOEs situated at the province and city levels are motivated by economic incentives. All Chinese investors embrace the ‘port-park-city’ model pioneered by Shenzhen, and we highlight its potential to foster regional development. We conclude that future research on Chinese infrastructure projects should be relational, multi-scalar and multi-sited.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This paper presents a first and most comprehensive assessment of the social impacts of shale gas production and utilisation for electricity generation, focusing on the UK context. The assessment has been carried out based on 14 indicators, addressing the following social sustainability issues: employment, health and safety, nuisance, public perceptions, local communities, infrastructure and resources. Shale gas is compared to a range of other electricity options, including other fossil fuels, nuclear and renewables. Where appropriate and possible, the social impacts are evaluated on a life cycle basis. The results suggest that extraction and utilisation of shale gas would lead to a range of benefits, including employment opportunities and financial gains by local communities. However, these are limited and countered by a number of social barriers that need to be overcome, including low public support, noise, traffic, strain on infrastructure (e.g. wastewater treatment facilities), land use conflict and availability of regulatory resources. Furthermore, shale gas does not present a notable opportunity for increasing energy security, unless its production increases significantly above current predictions. These findings can be used by policy makers, operators and other shale gas stakeholders with an interest in the social impacts of shale gas development. The results can also be useful for other countries planning to exploit their shale gas reserves.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

In the present work, MSNs modified with quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) and loaded with the biocide Parmetol S15 were synthesized as functional fillers for antifouling/antibacterial coatings. From the family of the MSNs, MCM-48 was selected as a carrier because of its cubic pore structure, high surface area, and high specific pore volume. The QASs used for the surface modification of MCM-48 were dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride and dimethyltetradecyl[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride. The QAS-modified MCM-48 reveals strong covalent bonds between the QAS and the surface of the nanoparticles. The surface functionalization was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, and ζ-potential measurements. Additional loading of the QAS-modified MCM-48 with a commercially available biocide (Parmetol S15) resulted in a synergetic dual antibacterial/antifouling effect. Either loaded or unloaded QAS-modified MSNs exhibited high antibacterial performance confirming their dual activity. The QAS-modified MCM-48 loaded with the biocide Parmetol S15 killed all exposed bacteria after 3 h of incubation and presented 100% reduction at the antibacterial tests against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, the QAS-modified MCM-48 without Parmetol S15 presented 77-89% reduction against the exposed Gram-negative bacteria and 78-94% reduction against the exposed Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, the modified MCM-48 was mixed with coating formulations, and its antifouling performance was assessed in a field test trial in northern Red Sea. All synthesized paints presented significant antifouling properties after 5 months of exposure in real seawater conditions, and the dual antifouling effect of the nanoparticles was confirmed.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Warming is a particular concern for urban areas due to urban densification and the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. To counteract the UHI, one adaptation strategy for urban areas is increasing the proportion of greenspace, such as parks, street tree plantings, and green roofs. This research employed an interdisciplinary approach to measure and model fine-scale microclimate changes due to greenspace and explore the implications for building energy demand in Manchester, UK. Both the modelled and measured microclimate data informed development of a series of weather files for building energy modelling of three commercial building types. For a scenario adding 5% mature trees to the urban case study, the combination of microclimate modelling and data analysis estimated a maximum hourly air temperature reduction of nearly 1.0°C under peak UHI conditions and wind speed reductions up to 1.0 m/s. These results were used to change the weather files in the building energy modelling, which estimated a reduction of 2.7% in July chiller energy due to the combination of reduced UHI peak hours and eight additional trees shading a three-storey shallow plan building. Energy savings increased to 4.8% under a three-day period of peak UHI conditions.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

D.;  & 2 others; Woodward, J. C.; Yıldırım, C.","1 Oct 2018","The relatively warm climate conditions prevailing today in the Mediterranean region limit cold geomorphological processes only to the highest mountain environments. However, climate variability during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene has led to significant spatio-temporal variations of the glacial and periglacial domain in these mountains, including permafrost conditions. Here, we examine the distribution and evolution of permafrost in the Mediterranean region considering five time periods: Last Glaciation, deglaciation, Holocene, Little Ice Age (LIA) and present-day. The distribution of inactive permafrost-derived features as well as sedimentary records indicates that the elevation limit of permafrost during the Last Glaciation was between 1000 m and even 2000 m lower than present. Permafrost was also widespread in non-glaciated slopes above the snowline forming rock glaciers and block streams, as well as meter-sized stone circles in relatively flat summit areas. As in most of the Northern Hemisphere, the onset of deglaciation in the Mediterranean region started around 19-20 ka. The ice-free terrain left by retreating glaciers was subject to paraglacial activity and intense periglacial processes under permafrost conditions. Many rock glaciers, protalus lobes and block streams formed in these recently deglaciated environments, though most of them became gradually inactive as temperatures kept rising, especially those at lower altitudes. Following the Younger Dryas glacial advance, the Early Holocene saw the last massive deglaciation in Mediterranean mountains accompanied by a progressive shift of permafrost conditions to higher elevations. It is unlikely that air temperatures recorded in Mediterranean mountains during the Holocene favoured the existence of widespread permafrost regimes, with the only exception of the highest massifs exceeding 2500-3000 m. LIA colder climate promoted a minor glacial advance and the spatial expansion of permafrost, with the development of new protalus lobes and rock glaciers in the highest massifs. Finally, post-LIA warming has led to glacial retreat/disappearance, enhanced paraglacial activity, shift of periglacial processes to higher elevations, degradation of alpine permafrost along with geoecological changes.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

In recent years, research on the United Kingdom's population has placed greater emphasis on population movement in shaping Britain's story, identifying waves of migrants from elsewhere alongside migration within Britain. One neglected aspect of this narrative, however, is the migration of Scots to England, particularly in the age of the regal and parliamentary union, when the changing political relationship between the two kingdoms had an impact on the scale, geographic spread, and opportunities and obstacles of that migration. While a minority of Scottish migrants were unwelcome, or chose to return home, the overwhelming weight of evidence is for those migrants who remained in England. The focus in this article is on that majority group for whom migration was a positive experience, thus raising questions about why these Scots were so successful and why they faced so little native opposition. That process of segmented assimilation offers an insight into the formation of Britain and the shifting ground of national identity associated with the emerging British state. The Scots, moreover, provide a model for “successful” migration, suggesting that a range of factors—principally, an educated, culturally malleable, and economically responsive migrant population, alongside an institutionally and attitudinally flexible host community—need to be in place in order to optimize the chances of migrant assimilation","Maritime","University of Manchester"

D.","31 Jan 2018","Storms and associated violent wave events have increased in frequency and intensity over the last number of years and this trend is set to continue in line with climate change and sea level rise predictions. Structures located directly landward of coastal structures are at risk from violent wave events and corresponding white-water overtopping. Depending on circumstances, experimental investigations into these effects may be expensive and difficult to undertake. This paper investigates the ability of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), a particle-based simulation method, to model these kinds of violent wave events. With numerical simulations being generally economic and faster to complete, developing a numerical model such as the one proposed in this paper would give designers a powerful tool to help design structures located landward of coastal defences and the defences themselves. The work presented herein is aimed at demonstrating the ability of the SPH method to model violent wave events against vertical seawalls by comparing the results from the numerical model to those obtained experimentally. The pressure envelopes obtained from the numerical and experimental models show general agreement where the mean and median of the uprush velocities from the SPH simulations are within 7% of the experimental data, thus confirming the potential of the SPH approach for this application.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

During 2014-15, a fissure eruption in Holuhraun (Iceland) emitted huge quantities of sulphur dioxide, resulting in significant reductions in liquid cloud droplet size. Using satellite observations and detailed modelling, we estimate a global mean radiative forcing from the resulting aerosol-induced cloud brightening for the time of the eruption of around -0.2 W.m-2. Changes in cloud amount or liquid water path are undetectable, indicating that these aerosol-cloud indirect effects are modest. It supports the idea that cloud systems are well buffered against aerosol changes as only impacts on cloud effective radius appear relevant from a climate perspective, thus providing a strong constraint on aerosol-cloud interactions. This result will reduce uncertainties in future climate projections as we are able to reject the results from climate models with an excessive liquid water path response.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

K.; Rogers, B. D.; Cunningham, L.

A shallow water and Boussinesq model is well suited to the investigation of both near-shore storm waves and tsunami waves. This paper makes use of the model to compare the effect on coastal structures of solitary waves and storm waves. Wave run-up parameters for both types of wave are generated and shown to be in good agreement with experimental data. The equations behind the model were derived assuming a small bed slope and therefore are not suitable for modelling waves interacting with vertical and near-vertical structures. However, the introduction of a reverse momentum term, to take account of a jet of water typical of a breaking wave impacting against a structure, allows wave overtopping volumes to be well predicted, although it had a minor effect on the forces acting on the structure. Comparisons with experimental data, for both solitary waves and storm waves, are presented. Using this model, the difference between the impact, in terms of wave forces and wave overtopping, of tsunami waves and storm waves for a given structure is investigated.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Valley glaciers radiated out from an ice field over the central plateau of the massif. The largest glaciations are likely to be Middle Pleistocene in age. Smaller valley and cirque glaciers formed later and boulders on the moraines of these glacial phases have been dated using 36Cl terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating. These ages indicate a Late Pleistocene age with glacier advance/stabilization at 40–30 ka, glacier retreat at 23–21 ka and advance/stabilization at 13–10 ka. This indicates that the glacial maximum of the last cold stage occurred during Marine Isotope Stage 3, several thousand years before the global Last Glacial Maximum (Marine Isotope Stage 2). The last phase of moraine-building occurred at the end of the Pleistocene, possibly during the Younger Dryas.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

This right presupposes the existence of an impartial judicial body through which litigants can ventilate their grievances. To guarantee access to court and the right to a fair trial, the Constitution establishes a court system for all civil claims. The cultural and religious plurality of the Nigerian state requires the creation of different courts for certain subject matters. This gives way for a potential conflict of jurisdiction. One of such conflicts is seen in the choice of court for questions bordering on personal law. While some legal commentators have considered this issue broadly, there is an aspect that is yet to be addressed. This aspect concerns the appropriate court for customary law questions in states that have refused to establish Customary Courts and a Customary Court of Appeal. The focus of this paper, therefore, is to examine the conundrum arising from the delineation of jurisdictional powers between a State High Court and a Customary Court of Appeal as it affects states that have no customary courts. The paper finds that existing precedents- Supreme Court and Court of Appeal- failed to take cognizance of this practical legal problem thereby creating a problem of access to justice. It argues that a State High Court, as a court of residual jurisdiction and as a forum of necessity, is an appropriate venue for customary personal law disputes in the northern states where customary courts are non-existent.

Strong Protestant interests at court and in the territorial estates within the Empire, it has been argued, prevented the Catholic monarch from joining the military campaign against the Ottomans.  However, I argue that this approach perpetuates an early modern Catholic interpretation that established the narrative of a Christian victory over ‘infidels’ by drawing parallels between Ottoman Muslims and German Lutherans.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

D.","Apr 2017","A substantial proportion of the UK coastline is heavily developed with major population centres such as Liverpool and Edinburgh owing their existence to their coastal location. In recent storms such as that of February 2014, instances of particularly violent wave impacts were observed. The resulting overtopping and associated pressures in these instances resulted in severe flooding and structural damage along the south and south-west coasts of the UK. In general, the buildings most severely affected by these events tend to be residential. In order to understand the response of such structures to these types of events, engineers need to be able to quantify the pressures resulting from the plumes generated by violent wave breaking, hereby termed as white water overtopping. For the design of coastal structures for wave overtopping EurOtop is the design manual currently in use in the UK, along with BS6349. However, both codes do not fully address the issue of white-water overtopping. A Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model was used to simulate an experiment carried out in the Large Wave Flume (GWK) in Hannover.

J.","Sep 2011","Media stories about global warming almost always mention “melting glaciers” and their effects upon global sealevel. The reader might therefore ask why the title of this chapter includes a question mark. It may seem blindingly obvious that global warming will cause a rise in global sealevel with a substantial contribution from melting glaciers, but the reasons are less obvious despite the copious literature. For example, the IPCC assessment reports 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2007 all include many references to published papers on glaciers (IPCC, 2011). These are admirable summaries of who has said what, or who has done what, but they do not explain why. My purpose for the present chapter is to provide a clear narrative on why we expect glacier melting to increase with any change in temperature, whether due to global warming or to natural fluctuations. By its very nature, the why of increased glacier melting must also answer the question of how much extra melting? The present chapter demonstrates empirically that higher melt is associated with higher air temperature. I do this in three stages: (1) correlating daily melt with daily air temperature for some Arctic and/or Greenland locations, (2) linking the results to the wider literature on the degree-method, and (3) showing that recent changes in glacier mass balance in the Alps are consistent with higher air temperatures in and around the Alps.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Thereafter, relationships between the abrasion resistance of concrete with its principal mechanical properties are comparatively examined. It is found that the use of natural coarse aggregates to replace fine aggregates by up to 25% does not significantly affect concrete abrasion performance, but the use of recycled tire rubber aggregates with aspect ratios of 4 to replace 25% of natural coarse aggregates increases the abrasion resistance by up to 64% depending on the test duration. Further, concretes produced with natural rounded coarse aggregates of 10 mm significantly outperformed those with angular 20 mm maximum particle size at all test durations by up to 57%. Finally, for the concrete mixtures tested, results indicate that tensile splitting strength is a superior parameter to compressive strength for predicting the concrete abrasion resistance in the ASTM C1138 test and the relations developed for the concretes tested predicted percentage abrasion loss within the margin of ±0.5%.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

These have suggested existence of different abrasion mechanisms, limitations of existing test methods and inconsistencies on the importance of compressive strength to abrasion resistance of concrete. The objective of this review is to: understand the mechanisms of concrete abrasion-erosion, assess the suitability of existing test methods to simulate field conditions and investigate the relationship between abrasion resistance and compressive strength. It is found that concrete abrasion mechanisms are dependent on both transport modes of abrasive charge and the ratio of coarse aggregate to matrix hardness. The ASTM C1138 (underwater) test method appears to simulate all the critical modes of sediment induced abrasion expected in field conditions and specific energy can be used as a framework to correlate ASTM C1138 test results with field measurements. With the exception of concrete with rubber aggregates, abrasion loss is found to fit a simple power function of its compressive strength, and no significant improvements in abrasion resistance  can be gained by using concretes with compressive strengths exceeding 60 MPa (8.70 ksi). Also, the influence of cementitious additives and coarse aggregate properties is only significant at compressive strengths below the optimal value of 60MPa (8.70 ksi).","Maritime","University of Manchester"

Its construction was initially funded by the European Investment Bank, but it is now part of the backbone of the Turkish Government’s Middle Corridor plan which enhances west-east connectivity and integration with the Caucasus and Central Asia. We show that in contrast to multinational corporations from the OECD that seek to remain footloose, Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) seek to adapt to, apprehend and ultimately shape local institutions. In the case of Turkey this proved difficult given its institutional alignment with the European Union. Thus, while the railway project was completed successfully by a consortium led by a Chinese SOE, Turkey’s dynamic and complex regulatory environment discourages Chinese SOEs in the infrastructure sector.

In the case of motorway building, this requires an understanding of how competing storylines about how both the infrastructure itself and the city it is located in are mobilised and politicised across diverse local geographies and multiple scales as the process proceeds. Our case study focuses on WestConnex, a 33 km motorway being built in Sydney, Australia. Similar to other major transport infrastructure projects, WestConnex morphed over time, growing in ambition, budget, complexity, debate and by enrolling new actors.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

J.","11 Dec 2020","The Younger Dryas (YD) was a period of rapid climate cooling that occurred at the end of the last glaciation. Here, we present the first palaeoglacier-derived reconstruction of YD precipitation across Europe, determined from 122 reconstructed glaciers and proxy atmospheric temperatures. Positive precipitation anomalies (YD versus modern) are found along much of the western seaboard of Europe and across the Mediterranean. Negative precipitation anomalies occur over the Fennoscandian ice sheet, the North European Plain, and as far south as the Alps. This is consistent with a more southerly and zonal storm track, which is linked to a concomitant southern location of the Polar Frontal Jet Stream, generating cold air outbreaks and enhanced cyclogenesis, especially over the eastern Mediterranean. This atmospheric configuration resembles the modern Scandinavian (SCAND) circulation over Europe (a blocking high pressure over Scandinavia pushing storm tracks south and east), and by analogy, a seasonally varying palaeoprecipitation pattern is interpreted.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

The Rarefied Orbital Aerodynamics Research (ROAR) facility is a novel experimental facility designed to simulate these conditions in a controlled environment to characterise the aerodynamic properties of materials. It is built as part of DISCOVERER, a Horizon 2020 project developing the different technologies required to enable the sustainable operation of satellites in VLEO. Because ROAR isn’t intended to perform erosion studies, it differs quite significantly from other atomic oxygen exposure experiments and its characteristics are discussed in this work. ROAR consists of an ultrahigh vacuum system, responsible for generating the free molecular flow conditions, a source of hyperthermal oxygen atoms at orbital velocities, and mass spectrometers; the latter used to characterise the gas-surface interactions, and therefore the material’s aerodynamic performance. This paper includes a description of ROAR’s main components, together with the experimental methodology for materials testing and early results. Among the main parameters to be considered are atomic oxygen flux, beam shape and energy spread, mass resolution, and signal-tonoise ratio.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

"Exploiting resources that are the common heritage of mankind: how could African states benefit from the developing legal framework for deep sea mining?","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/exploiting-resources-that-are-the-common-heritage-of-mankind-how-","Larsen, P.","1 Sep 2018","This paper aims to unpack the potential of Part XI of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law Of the Sea (UNCLOS), that regulates international deep sea mining (DSM), to be used as an instrument for African economic advancement. After accounting for the possibilities and limitations of national mining, capacity building and sponsoring mining licenses respectively, the second part of this paper concludes that the present framework does not substantially benefit African states. It following problematises how ‘benefit sharing’ under the common heritage of mankind principle is used to all the same justify this hazardous industry, and to push the threshold for acceptable harm to the environment, however such harm will affect the least developed first. Following, attempting to ameliorate both the financial and environmental situation for the least developed in consequence of DSM, the last part of this paper proposes a new model for liability and benefit sharing. This model holistically considers liability regulations together with the proposed liability ‘Fund’ and the financial mechanism for redistribution. Revenue earmarked for redistribution will otherwise to great part be redirected to the Fund to fill gaps in liability. This paper for all demonstrates how the present, much lacking ‘equitable’ liability model is flawed. Setting the standard for liability based on Nauru—the smallest (Pacific island) state in the world—does not benefit undeveloped states elsewhere. It enables access for the Pacific island states that are of particular interest to industry. Benefits for other non-industrialised states such as African will likely be via redistribution. This paper therefore proposes a residual liability model with exclusive positive discrimination of developing sponsoring states in Fund cover. Such cover will be premised on the state having fulfilled its due diligence obligation, however, a sponsored contractor cannot be subjected to pay in full. This model sets a comparatively highest standard of liability in DSM that assumed would create stronger incentives for state supervision. The difference is the relative deprivation of the opportunity for industrialised states who do not effectively control their contractors to socialise risk—via ‘equitable’ fund-dumping—whilst reaping the rewards. This financially restrictive model would further hinder the institutionalisation of new exploitation damage to pay for the previous. In conclusion, a win-win for the environment and developing states alike. ","Maritime","University of Manchester"

First, I investigate the disconnect between the present and the past in contemporary Singapore and argue that contemporary Singapore cinema is microcosmic of the nation’s uncomfortable relationship with the past. Drawing from Marc Augé’s work in order to understand this temporal disconnect, I propose to think of the nation as a non-place, where the nation is thought of as a liminal entity. Ultimately, I call for a reconsideration of Singapore cinema through the lens of temporal heterogeneity, suggesting that the notion of the nation as a non-place allows us to not only understand the evolving present of the nation(al) but also cinema’s role in helping access the past.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

In particular, the amount of snow or ice melted at a certain place, during a certain period, is assumed proportional to the sum of positive temperatures (on the Celsius scale) at the same place and in the same period. The amount of melt is linked to this positive degree-day sum by the degree-day factor.

Made in Palermo in the 1130s, it is often known as the mantle of Roger II. Following his coronation in 1130, King Roger II saw the need to ensure the succession of his sons. As part of his strategy to consolidate dynastic succession, Roger invested his sons with important titles in the mainland regions of the kingdom. This article has two parts: the first discusses the materials used to make the mantle, the journeys they took to reach Sicily and the diplomatic and commercial relationships necessary to acquire them. The second part argues that the mantle may have been made for the investiture ceremonies of the king’s sons and examines how the materials and their exoticism shaped the ceremonial meaning of the garment.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
"Seafood businesses’ resilience can benefit from circular economy principles","https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/seafood-businesses-resilience-can-benefit-from-circular-economy-p","Fletcher, C.; St Clair, R.; Sharmina, M.","21 Apr 2021","Seafood is expected to become increasingly important in future food systems and healthy diets. This transition will require the seafood sector to adapt business practices to respond to environmental and social challenges while increasing resilience. Here, we develop the Circular Economy-Resilience Framework for Business Models (CERF-BM) and, through exploring current literature, apply this framework to business models in the seafood sector. We find that the majority of business models incorporate elements of circular economy and resilience in a limited way. The reviewed business models often fail to consider other supply chain actors and, instead, focus on the business itself and its customers. The CERF-BM helps to elucidate this disconnect through assessing business models against company-level actions towards circularity in combination with systems-level resilience mechanisms. To reap the synergies between the circular economy and resilience mechanisms, seafood businesses could extract more value from organic waste and dematerialise their business models.

Starting from the premise that planetary socio-technical transformations in this vein have distinctly national drivers, we focus on the urban agency of Chinese-led investment. The paper explores how different forms of infrastructural development generated by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) affects transformations in the political and material fabric of cities and their host regions. We approach BRI-related infrastructural practice through three interconnected optics–discourse, instruments, and politics–so as to interrogate the articulation of projects linked to the BRI within the material site of the urban. Based on theorisations of infrastructure from an urban perspective and a critical review of literature on the BRI itself, we develop three illustrative case studies at different spatial scales and within different geographic contexts–in Pakistan, Central Europe and the UK. To examine the cases as well as their embeddedness in broader debates on the topic, we use a systematic review methodology relying on a wide variety of sources. We offer comparative and relational perspectives on the manner in which these relatively diverse cases demonstrate China’s role as a global urban actor.","Maritime","University of Manchester"

A new indicator, i.e., Total Drape Angle (TDA), was proposed based on the three-dimensional fabric drape to characterize the ability of a woven fabric to drape. The relationship between TDA and Drape Coefficient (DC) was analyzed to validate the performance of TDA. The result indicated that TDA is more stable and representative than the traditional DC in characterizing the ability of a woven fabric to drape. In addition, the distribution function of drape angle (DADF) of the triangular mesh was employed to describe fabric drape, as well as to bridge the gap between drape configuration and the warp bending rigidity of woven fabric. The result shows that the correlation coefficient between the real value of warp bending rigidity and the predicted warp bending rigidity based on DADF and fabric weight is 0.952.","Maritime","University of Manchester"
